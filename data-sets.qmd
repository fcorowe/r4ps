## Greater Machester land use data

### Availability {.unnumbered}

The dataset is stored on a gpkg file that can be found, within the structure of this project, under:

```{r}
st_LSOA <- st_read("./data/geodemographics/manchester_land_cover_2011.gpkg")
```

### Variables {.unnumbered}

The variables included in this dataset follow the land use classification of the CORINE Land Cover dataset.

### Source & Pre-processing {.unnumbered}

The data was sourced from [What do 'left behind' areas look like over time?](https://github.com/GDSL-UL/APPG-LBA/blob/main/README.md) and cleaned on Python.

## British administrative boundaries (LSOAs, MSOAs and LAs)

### Availability {.unnumbered}

The dataset for the boundaries of the lower-layer super-output areas (LSOAs) within London is stored as a shapefile that can be found under:

```{r}
st_LSOA <- st_read("data/geodemographics-old/LSOA_2011_London_gen_MHW/LSOA_2011_London_gen_MHW.shp")
```

Data for the shapes of the MSOAs must be downloaded from UK's GeoPortal [here](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?q=BDY_MSOA%20DEC_2021&sort=Title%7Ctitle%7Casc). Make sure you download the 2021 version and store it in the `.\data\machine-learning\` folder as a file with the .gpkg extension. We have not included the file in the GitHub repo due to its large size. You can load it with `st_read` and ensure it is in a projection system of choice.

The dataset for the boundaries of the local authority distrits (LADs) for the UK is stored as a shapefile that can be found under:

```{r}
LA_UK <- st_read("./data/networks/Local_Authority_Districts_(December_2022)_Boundaries_UK_BFC/LAD_DEC_2022_UK_BFC.shp")
```

### Variables {.unnumbered}

For each of the 4,835 LSOAs, the following characteristics are available:

```{r}

-   `geometry`: Polygon of LSOA

For each of the 374 LADs, the following characteristics are available:

```{r}
names(LA_UK)
```

-   `LAT`: Location Latitude
-   `GlobalID`: Global Identifier
-   `SHAPE_Leng`: Boundary length
-   `SHAPE_Area`: Area within boundary
-   `geometry`: Polygon of LAD

### Projection {.unnumbered}

The shapes of each LSOA are stored as polygons an expressed in the OSGB36 projection:

```{r}
st_crs(st_LSOA)
```

Similarly, the shapes of each LAD are stored as polygons an expressed in the OSGB36 projection:

```{r}
st_crs(LA_UK)
```

### Source & Pre-processing {.unnumbered}

The boundaries for the LSOAs within London can be found directly from the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/statistical-gis-boundary-files-london) website.

The boundaries for the LADs for the UK can be found on the ONS Open Geography Portal [website](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/search?collection=Dataset&sort=name&tags=all(BDY_LAD%2CDEC_2022)). To filter for the London LADs, i.e. the London boroughs, we run the following line of code:

```{r}
LND_boroughs <- LA_UK %>% filter(grepl('E09', LAD22CD)) 
```

## Twitter migration data for the UK

### Availability

The dataset is stored on a gpkg file that can be found, within the structure of this project, under:

```{r}
st_LSOA <- st_read("./data/networks/internal_migration_uk.csv")
```

### Source and preprocessing

The data was created for the paper [@Wang2022]. The paper includes details on the methodology.

<!-- ### Variables {.unnumbered} -->

<!-- For each of the 52,930 movements recorded on the dataset for the migration flows between US metropolitan areas, the following fields are available: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- names(df_metro) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- All the fields that start with `MSA_Current_` or `MSA_Previous_` refer to the characteristics of the origin and destination metropolican areas. The relevant fields for the analysis in this book are: -->

<!-- -   `Movers_Metro_to_Metro_Flow_Estimate`: Estimate of number of people moving between origin and destination -->

<!-- -   `Movers_Metro_to_Metro_Flow_MOE`: Margin of error for the above estimate -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- where: -->

<!-- -   `OutLA` is the code corresponding to the origin borough -->

<!-- -   `InLA` is the code corresponding to the destination borough -->

<!-- -   `Moves` is the number of internal migration moves within each flow. Note that the numbers are not integers. This is because of the various scaling processes used to produce the dataset, which are described in more detail in the latest methodology document, which can be found [here](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/migrationwithintheuk/datasets/internalmigrationbyoriginanddestinationlocalauthoritiessexandsingleyearofagedetailedestimatesdataset). -->

head(df_dictionary)
```

### Source & pre-processing {.unnumbered}

Data on the the census characteristics for different MSOAs can be downloaded from the [Nomis website](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2021/bulk). Data on the average net household income can be obtained from the [ONS website](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/smallareaincomeestimatesformiddlelayersuperoutputareasenglandandwales).
