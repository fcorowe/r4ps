&amp;#x200B;

So, back story I had my son at 17 with a boy who was not ready to be a father. Fine. I lived with my son's father's grandparents (my son's great grandparents) for a time because my parents were divorcing, and they had space for us. It was all well and good until my son was about one, and I met my now fiancé. We started to do things as a family and the great grandparents started to get mad that the baby wasn't with them as much. They about lost it when I moved out on my own. My son was 4, hadn't heard from his dad in over 3 years, and I got served papers from his father asking for full custody of my son. The paperwork was all filled out in the great grandmother's handwriting \*eye roll\*. They even went so far as to write a letter to the judge detailing every time they agreed to watch my son, and twisted it seem as though I was a flighty, irresponsible mother. Furthest thing from the truth.

Show up for court and in the end they got every other weekend and a day during the week, and a week in the summer. I say they because the father would quite literally just drop my son off with the great grandparents and leave. He is an alcoholic and would often not show up because of that reason, even lost his license for a time and was still driving my son around. ugh. They would try to manipulate my son (who was 4/5 years old at the time) into thinking I was the bad guy because they would wait until the last second before pick up and get him involved in an art project, or bring out a big new shiny toy, and I would have to tell my son we cant stay and play, or take it with us because we had a small apartment, he would cry and they would comfort him. This went on for a some years until the pandemic hit (my son was then 9/10 years old) and my son's father up and fucked off, again. The great grandmother herself suggested my son not be around his father at that time because his father was/is not taking precautions to be safe. He hasn't even texted me asking about my son since May 2020.

However, the great grandparents have wanted to see my son, who is now 13, and I was allowing it for a time, but these people just show over and over their complete lack of respect for me as a parent. We would establish a time for the visit and I would ask my son come home at a certain time. They would wait till the last possible moment and call me to say they started a movie and would be late, or ask if he could spend the night, and if I said no they would be like ""your mom said you cant stay for more fun"". She would text him and make these plans and then not ask me until the last minute and when we had plans already it would be the same deal. I asked them to ask me first, not my son with plans. They then talked about a birthday party for a cousin in front of my son so that it was my son asking me about it, then again they wait till the last minute to make the plans. I tell them we as a family with a child too young to be vaccinated (my daughter) are avoiding large crowds, they take my son to the mall at peak Christmas time. I tell them my son has a fever he cant attend a basketball game, they call him and tell him to ""have his vaccine card ready"" because they are going to try to convince me to let him go any way, then they tell him all the fun things he is going to do there (of course I didn't let him go he was sick). This woman SHOWS UP AT MY HOUSE with out telling me and my sister was home with my daughter, scared the crap out of her, and when I told her not to just show up at my house she said ""well I didn't see any cars in the drive way so I thought it was fine"".  They get on my case all the time saying they ""don't know what my problem is"", but they are my problem and the lack of respect they have for me. The last time they picked my son up they told me they were going to take him to a place near me, but then I find out they took him about 45 min to an hour away and didn't think that that was something they should have clued me in on.

I really don't want to send my son with them any more, its not like he is asking me to go there or see them. Am I overreacting?

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\* EDIT to clarify, we are no longer following the every other weekend court order, haven't since my son's father walked out again. The my son seeing his great grandparents is purely voluntary, because I have no legal obligation to them. Thankfully.","entitledparents",528,528,0,0.99,1,0,0,42

Full article: (boldface is mine)

Lets go with the assumptionas much of a stretch as it may bethat Bed Bath &amp; Beyond manages to pull off its Houdini-like magic trick and gets the financing to continue to stay in business (and out of bankruptcy). Then what?

If you consider the companys original store format in the 1970s and 80sback then it was just Bed &amp; Bathas 1.0, and its 1987 expansion into the Beyond hard goods categories as 2.0, then the private brand era of the past two years was 3.0. On tap is the next version: BBB 4.0.

The beleaguered retailerwhich has secured new funds with the expectation that more are on the wayhas sketched out a new strategy that is long on optimism but short on specifics. In a statement last week, CEO Sue Gove focused on the big picture: This transformative transaction will provide runway to execute our turnaround plan. We continue to put our customers at the center of every decision, positioning Bed Bath &amp; Beyond to meet and exceed their expectations, while resetting our foundation for near- and long-term success.

**On Thursday afternoon, BOH was able to access two calls during which BBB executives provided further details to its suppliersone call was with conventional vendors, and the other one was with direct-to-consumer brands. Most important, they indicated BBB would begin to pay for merchandise in advance or COD depending on the vendors preference. They also said DTC suppliers would start getting paid immediately after BBB was paid by shoppers for orders that are fulfilled directly by the vendor.**

**Executives also said they would be moving to net pricing terms, which would eliminate many of the special charges the store has used in the past to reduce its payments to its suppliers. Its all part of what Gove called the companys new supplier promise. New interim CFO Holly Etlin was blunter when she said BBB was taking the next few months to clean up its act.**

Beyond new payment terms, heres what we know so far about what management has in mind going forward:

Stores: From its high of some 1,500 stores just a few years ago, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is radically slashing its fleet and says it will end up with about 360 stores, plus another 120 BuyBuy Baby locations. All stores in Canadaabout 65 between the two nameplatesare closing as the company exits the country entirely. (Curiously, it has said nothing about its joint venture in Mexico, where it has a handful of locations.) The new U.S. footprint will represent a drastic reduction, with broad swaths of the country having few if any stores left.

E-commerce: The company has not shared what percentage of its overall business is done online, but the last time it did, in the first quarter of 2021, it was 38 percent, albeit during the pandemic conditions when everyone was shopping online. All Bed Bath &amp; Beyond will say now is that the digital channel is expected to rise to a higher proportion of sales with improved channel profitability. Yet none of its statements on how the new funding will be used make mention of investment in its subpar digital operation.

Merchandising: Heres where it gets really vague. We are prioritizing availability of leading national and emerging direct-to-consumer brands our customers know and love, said Gove in a press release, which probably means the company will continue to de-emphasize private label merchandise and bring in more DTC brands. But these are the same national brands Bed Bath &amp; Beyond previously carried in its 2.0 erathe same period of decline that led to the pivot toward private label goods. On the DTC front, the retailer already carries Casper and has started to bring in some other digitally native players, but all of these brands are pursuing physical store distribution on their own as well, and it will be hard for the company to stand out.

Physical format and fulfillment: This one is intriguing. **The Company will also be pursuing asset-light inventory management strategies to drive growth, including vendor-direct-to-consumer, marketplace and the potential for innovative collaborations,** said the release. The vendor-direct strategy for online orders is something BBB has been doing for years, as have most other retailers. (Wayfair, in particular, takes very little ownership of goods, relying on its suppliers to handle fulfillment.) But what does that approach mean for stores? Is the company suggesting leased or consignment departments that vendors run and staff? While that is a component of department store retailing for luxury brands and beauty, theres very little of that in the home space. Only ABC Carpet &amp; Home in New York pursued that strategy in its heyday, and it has never been scaled up to any degree anywhere. **Innovative collaborations could mean just about anythingor, frankly, nothing.**

Operations: Bed Bath &amp; Beyond says it expects to achieve significant cost savings as it drastically reduces the size of the company. Supply chain, technology, expense structure and business processes will continue to be streamlined as the company realigns its operational foundation was how Gove put it. **That process has already begun with serious layoffs at corporate headquarters** in Union, New Jersey, and with hundreds of store-closing sales underway.

Will all of this be enough? And will it be in time? The new financial lifeline investors have extended is not all that long, and in the meantime, current sales have likely been severely diminishedat least one independent source reported that many stores are managing inventory levels off 40 percent from optimum.

All of those bankruptcy headlines cant have helped customer enthusiasmor worker morale, for that matter. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond 4.0 is most certainly a work in progress. Grove has to hope it will indeed result in progress.","BBBY",527,527,0,0.97,0,0,0,48

When my kids were babies, she was the MIL who refused to honor my wishes re: no kissing the baby, no ""fake biting"" the baby. Yes, that was her thing. She wanted the right to fake bite my baby's arm. It was her way to bond. She declined an invitation to attend a birthday party in the park, because celebrating outdoors is beneath her.

Fast forward to the pandemic. As soon as it hit, MIL was isolated due to the fear of covid. She is healthy but age is definitely a factor. So, we respected her wishes and we didn't see her for 18 months, until she was fully vaccinated. Then, she only wanted to see us outdoors! And her excuse was that our children weren't vaccinated yet (at that time, vaccines weren't offered to children).

 We saw her that one time on our deck, where she sat and ate and barely interacted with the kids. 

Since then, my kids got their full vaccines but MIL changed her tune and said the risk to see them was too high.

A few weeks ago, my husband's brother's father-in-law passed away. There was a memorial service held in a tiny hotel reception area. Quite obviously indoors. Packed with people Food was served and masks were only worn when people weren't helping themselves to the buffet. Yes, there was a buffet. But my covid-conscious MIL attended. And she took off her mask to help herself to the buffet. We attended as well. She saw my husband and squeezed his cheeks with her dirty hands, pointed out his bald spot, and asked if the suit he was wearing is the same one from high school (20 years ago. It wasn't). She ran around quacking about her now she's fully vaccinated, times 4, she needs to move on with her life. She's done everything she could.

In the 2+ years since covid hit, my husband had surgery  and had to be off his feet for months. I worked from home, took care of the kids' virtual schooling, and did ALL of the errands that my husband used to help out with. No help from MIL. No concern.

So, my kids have a cello recital. They both worked had. They've won awards in the past. This is important to them. We invited MIL and she declined. It is a much less covid-hazardous event. But my MIL has seen her other son in person, has been inside his home, has attended his father-in-law memorial service. My kids get nothing. 

I am from Ukraine. As an immigrant, though not recent, I have no extended family. My parents died when I was a teen. This is it for grandparents for my kids.

That's it. I just wanted to vent. Give it to me straight. Maybe I'm just delusional.","JUSTNOMIL",520,520,0,0.97,0,0,0,53

Who is **Kendrick Lamar**????? I cant imagine this is worth answering in 2022, but hes a good kid from a MAAD city (a.k.a Section 80) and he taught us how to pimp a butterfly while the whole world said DAMN to even his most untitled and unmastered hits. Do ya googles

As I get a little older (literally today is my birthday) I realize life is about perspective. That one word, changes how you and i give and receive information.

So my perspective is that i heard of Kendrick early. I cant say exactly when. It was the infamous mixtape era for sure. But that time is honestly just a blur of datpiff cover arts and cigarillos minimally filled with weed hoping for a maximum high. I do remember downloading both of his mixtapes. Not on purpose hilariously enough, no i was a music junkie so anything that looked dope got downloaded in mass. It was the *Kendrick Lamar Ep* and *Overly Dedicated.* It just didnt get played. When i finally did, to add more weirdness, i didnt care for overly dedicated. I really dont have to explain, i do think theres too much of that going on these days, but in this case i want to. I vaguely remember why i didnt care for it, but it was mainly that the songs like Michael Jordan etc that i just wasnt as into at the time. Not bad music by any stretch, but at that time i was super backpack. Im talking Ghostface Killah, Mos Def, Lupe, Mood Musik times. So it wasnt often that i played more up tempo or even braggadocios music. I went to college somewhat knowing who he was, but still not really playing his music. I dont think i ever played the Kendrick Lamar Ep, which truly makes me think things happen for a reason because if i had, he would have been one of my favorites from them.

In college i made one really good friend early. He was from California and we were in Kentucky where i was actually born. Somehow we just got each other more than most. The kind of friendship i never ask you do you have weed, only do you wanna smoke when i do. He actually brought up Kendrick again, BUT, and maybe Im the only one that this has happened to, but he played some of the O.D mixtape in a different light and i loved it. Im not sure how but by the time i doubled back to the intro, i was in awe. Im not sure how i missed it, as the display of lyricism and content was enough for me to fully start to appreciate his music. In this same year span, he not only was featured on Mac Miller (another person who i didnt like at first, but once he started talking about drugs and the life i lived i loved it), but Section 80 came out. So, perspective. Section 80 is my good kid MAAD city, if i had to vote for a perfect kendrick album it would be TPAB, and my favorite album to listen to by Kendrick as of now is Mr. Morale and the Big Steppers. Ill explain

***United in Grief*** is an interesting opener. While this is one of my favorite albums of the year, this record in particular may be my least favorite. When I FIRST heard the album I listened to every record no skips. There is no bad music on this album. But this album does introduce an interesting concept. Should music be forever? Pineapple Express is one of my favorite movies, Ive seen it a thousand times and I can quote the entire movie if I wanted to. So by that definition is an amazing movie. But on the other hand, seven pounds changed my life. I have only seen it maybe 6 or 7 times because I love tragedy. But with such a deep impact, its also great. That is what Kendrick is introducing to music. He knew we would all tune into track one at least. So he said all of the things he felt he needed to in a run on sentence type fashion. A line that sticks out to me is **I grieve different**. I never really related to Kendrick. Loved his albums, have been a fan since around 2010, but I didnt relate. This felt like one of those universal lines. Some people take off work and grieve. I bought more weed and cried on my way to work about my grandmother for a week. We ALL grieve different. While he was quiet through the pandemic, he like all of us learned something. In this case, this is the first time Ive heard Kendrick talk about the other side of being who he is. So the statement hits extremely hard because you know Kendrick watched everything that happened, and one of the first thoughts he wanted to share with us when he came back is **I grieve different**.

***N95*** is my album opener. When I pull up this album, Im clicking on this to start my run. I dont listen to the entire album anymore, as I respect it as a piece of art that doesnt need replay value. Yet another example of Kendrick being ahead of the curve. Art doesnt have a singular definition, yet sometimes rap makes it seem like it does. Albums like Testing are crucified for straying too far away from the artists discography. I lived through Yeezus and let me tell you, nobody liked it originally. Dont even get me started on 808s, I specifically recall being ridiculed for liking that weird shit. So in a world where most people are putting on so many different things to fit in, here Kendrick is saying take it off. Not one to waste a moment, the moment hes told you to take off every single thing that youve put on without it really being you, he tells you **ughhh, you ugly as fuck**. Clearly hes had enough time to analyze himself as well as the world 4 times over. It could easily be one of the deepest lines of the record if you think about it. Yes youre ugly. So am I. Thats what makes us beautiful. You could surely take that line at face value and say the cool kid from the mad city is back on his bragging, but I disagree. This record may have more of the traditional Kendrick markers from his albums pre hiatus, but it seems like hes bridging us to something new. Even with all his success in the first half of his career, he still changes and pushes boundaries. **Ohh you worried about a critic, that aint protocol** says it best. With lines like that, its clear to see that if Nas isnt relevant, the kids are being raised wrong.

I told you that I didnt really relate to Kendrick. He was always a cool kid to me, not just because of his music, but the way hes been perceived as well. Ever single person from that era has had at least one negative narrative except Kendrick. Ive spent hours arguing this exact thing with friends. J Cole was quote unquote boring. Big Sean was called corny. Childish was seen as soft. Not saying any of these are true, just proving my point. Ive always debated Kendrick is a mastermind that watched the complaints his classmates received and did extra curricular work to be sure he was never the victim. I was unpopular so I related more to Childish. But when Kendrick said  **I dont know how to feel, like the first time I fucked a white bitch** on ***Worldwide Steppers*** I was instantly transported back to that dorm room when i didnt know how to feel. In was in college, which was the first time i had ever really interacted with white girls. Here i was, asking myself if this was worth the perception that would follow, if i was actually wrong for doing it, could i still be a black leader once people found out all crossed my mind before i even had the condom on. Most people will hear that and not think much of it. But to me, especially with the fact that kendrick had a exact recollection of each time he crossed that line, i believe he too sees it as somewhat of a traumatic event. Not the act itself, but the self questions and self blaming that comes with that for a black man isnt something a wise man can just shrug off.

***Die Hard*** would be the record that i originally started at after several, and i do mean plus 15 listens of the full album from the day prior to release on. Once digested, i started to pick my favorites and Die Hard just captures everything i didnt know that i wanted from Kendrick. This is the first song I knew Id be playing for the foreseeable future due to it containing mantras like **I hope Im not too late, to set my demons straight/I know I made you wait, but how much can you take**?. For a person who has admittedly not achieved as much as I want in life, words like this are golden. Who cant relate to wanting just a bit more time to get everything right? Im 31 and Im learning more from adopting two huskies at once than I can recall in most of my years of school. Its becoming clear he has tapped into what could be seen as universal truths, whereas before you could argue Kendrick was speaking to a specific audience with each album, regardless of how well the album did. Its like Jay-Zs album Reasonable Doubt. If you judge by the lingo and the content on the album, you could argue it was only for high level players and very established drug dealers. Kind of like a memo among a company. But with this album, and maybe for the rest of his career, Kendrick isnt just talking to Compton. Or to black people. Or to the youth of the lost age. Hes talking to the world, which to me, is another mark of his genius. **I hope you see the god in me, I hope you can see, and if its up stay down for me** isnt a complex scheme, but as well all know you can be looked down upon for things you said or done. Here Kendrick is pleading for you to see the divine root in him despite human actions that take place daily. **I get emotional about life/the lost ones keeping me up at night/the world be reminding me its danger/I still risk it all for a stranger/if I told you who I was would you use it against me?/right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me** is extremely profound. I will not use extreme examples here as that could be too controversial and ultimately not worth the metaphor, but lets take Dave Chappelle. As a member of his Reddit for a while I was proud to see how people didnt let media narratives dictate who he was to them. Then the Elon musk incident happened. There were quite a few people who were quick to bash and denounce him because it was cool to do over a single joke he made they didnt care for. Kendricks lyrics make me ask the same question again, is there no kind of system where we can properly account of the all the good deeds someone has done when we finally find a bad one? Will smith was safe. Like for a black guy safe lol. Up until that slap not one public incident or outburst. I think we can all recall how many he should be in jail phrases were thrown around. What is the point of telling people who you are if theyll use it against you? When something happens most people quickly say how they never cared for you anyways. Im not saying that you should blindly agree with things you dont, and neither is Kendrick. No singular action makes you good, nor evil. It is the sum of all actions multiplied by your intentions. But even then, should we as humans be able to definitively say either way? Slink Johnson said it best, let ye WITHOUT sin cast the first stone. **I wonder when I lost my way/been waiting on your call all day/tell me youre in my corner right now/when I fall short Im leaning on you to cry out** further pushes this point. Maybe we all are just one phone call from a fan or loved one away from finding our path again.

With the opening of ***Father Time***, I find myself chuckling. Ive just never really known much of anything about Kendrick. More of an enigma. But for him to say what Ive said to my (ex) girlfriends countless times was hilarious. It serves as yet another glimpse into situations hes been in. I **got daddy issues, thats on me** is a perfect example of the accountability thats present all over the album. In reality, most of us have some issues with how our fathers did, or didnt, raise us. Even though this is an old concept, if people like Kendrick dont reiterate it, its usually lost from one generation to the next, even as far as him identifying to still have those problems at his age is on him. One of my absolute favorite lyrics from the album is **When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused/guess Im not mature as I think, got some healing to do** and its for good reason. This was something I had only talked about with close homies and hadnt heard too much publicly about. If my understand of that beef and the events that took place (like Drake allegedly sleeping with Yes mother in law as well as Ye saying he found Kim in the bed with Chris Paul and there being videos of Drake wearing his jersey shooting shots) I cant understand why he would become cool with a guy like that. Drake literally said on his new album, **linking with the ops, bitch I did that shit for j prince/I did it for the mob ties/feels like seventeen, two Percs, frog eyes/and Ive never been the one to go apologize/me Id rather hit em up one more time** so I was just as confused that anyone would allow someone whos openly duplicitous in their friend circle. Maybe Im not as mature as I should be either because after a beef like that, we dont gotta be enemies. Its enough people dying as it is. But we surely dont have to be friends. And for Kendrick to touch on that it was a huge moment, the kind where you realize even in your most outlandish takes, youre not alone.

I have not listened to Kodak Black, ever. If Im not mistaken when he came out I wasnt as musically accepting, as I was a backpack kid. As open as I am with music, I still have not downloaded a single album of his. So for someone like Kendrick to put his record ***Rich (interlude)*** on his platform, its major. I sat and listened to every bar of Kodaks at least 15 times, which is much more than I would have when left to my own devices. I think tracks like this are important, not just to expand horizons but also build more brotherhood in a business that we invented but do not control. It didnt make me a fan, but it did make me realize he definitely has something to say, which Id argue is more valuable. Fans have expectations but if I think you have something to say I may give you multiple chances to do that.

***Rich Spirit*** is another example of what Kendrick brings this offering. A super catchy hook, with the new mind state courtesy of everything hes been through as well as talks with his therapist. **Rich n\*\*\*a, broke phone/tryna keep the balance, im staying strong** sounds like the words that got him thru the last 5 years of not releasing any music. It shouldnt be undervalued to be the type of artist that can make music other artists will gravitate towards. Kendrick floats effortlessly all over this track, which is absolutely typical. I feel like some things are worth mentioning and some arent. In 2022, if youre not aware of the typical things that Kendrick does, this review probably isnt for you. Im of the beliefs two type of people are coming to this review. People who want to see their favorite album of the year celebrated, or people who didnt like it and want to see why others celebrated it. By the end I hope to answer both. This is the Kendrick that I will take with me for the rest of my life. Realistically this album covers a lot more themes and issues Ill be dealing with moving forward, where as songs like Backseat Freestyle dont hold as much weight as they did when I was in college. This is inevitable. Huge Jay Z fan growing up, but I play only 3-5 of his albums now. In my opinion there should be mutual growth. Human nature is to evolve. Rich spirit showcases some of what we can expect from Kendrick at this stage in his life, and content wise I believe this is as good as it gets. Personal confessions over minimal production will always have a warm place in my heart anyways so maybe Im biased, but when someone is vulnerable and can show their flaws as well as their triumphs, I dont think theres anything better when it comes to music. The original purpose of music was to convey a message, so its great to see thats not lost here

***We Cry Together*** has to be in the top 10 of all time for hip hop love songs. Yes, I said it. Let me be clear. Is this a toxic relationship on display? Absolutely. Its hard to argue that saying fuck you constantly back and forth isnt toxic. BUT. Who is really able to fully pass judgment? Romeo and Juliet is an amazing love story. But how many times have you seen a guy/girl willing to die rather than live without their love? Now how many love stories have you heard of like We Cry Together? Much more common. It reminds me of a 2pac line **they say Jesus is a kind man, but we should understand times in this crime land**. To me, there should always be a variable when you add up any equation that should represent how things change. So if you take away all the judgment, this song is beautiful. Its on the list of songs that I dont often play anymore, which throws back to my original point that Kendrick is introducing two different types of music here. The kind youll keep with you in your pocket, as well as a song you could hear once and it will change your life (Kim anyone?). The dialogue here is also TOP NOTCH. He didnt just do a toxic love song, he did THE toxic love song that anybody could play and get a good glimpse of the gender relations of today. Its even more appropriate that their f**uck yous** turn to **fuck** **mes** once the couple has vented all their negative emotions. Even with the title you have to respect his intelligence to take the typical phrase we love together or we pray together to one of its natural opposites. Thats the truth of life that not every artist touches on. To throw back to an earlier record, hes just **tryna keep the balance** and i couldnt appreciate it more

Im just gonna say this and leave it here. **Shut the fuck up when you hear love talking** is one of the best lines on the album. Hell, in the last 10 years of rap its one of the best rap lines. Why? Everybody remembers, **i am the beast, feed me rappers or feed me beats** right? To me, this line has an equal amount of staying power. Lil wayne was capturing a whole mixtape era with two sentences. So with Kendricks line, i feel like post pandemic, this is equally as important. Personally i think thats why subreddits like r/wholesome or r/brosbeingbros are flourishing. People want to sit silently and watch moments of humanity being as great as we can, because we have all watched the ugly side of humanity for at least the last two years. When i heard this song it instantly put me in such a good mood. Kendrick and summer and two vocals i wouldnt have requested to be overlapped before, but now hearing their chemistry i cant be the only one hoping summer doesnt show up again, especially considering the days when Kendrick, or most of TDE showing up with Jhene or Sza are over. Ghostface showing up is everything to me. He delivers a very potent verse, but its more important to me that a kid from Compton recognizes one of the Wu Tang greats. While the first half of the CD definitely had some moments for me that made it worth the wait for Kendrick, in all honesty i was a little let down my first listen. Not because its bad music, not at all. I just by the highs. *Die Hard*, *N95*, *Rich Spirit*, and ***Purple Hearts*** are such high highs that in comparison every track didnt match up to me. I know what youre thinking, how on earth could this be one of his favorite albums of the year if hes said he only really likes 40% of the first disc? Well&

In case you didnt know, ***Count Me Out*** is one of the best intros in years. Not only that, but this is that record that your favorite, and your favorite, and his favorite all recognize as a kind of hey, this is how well i rap record. Its just top tier lyricism. The way the choir in the background just kind of ushers you down the aisle as Kendrick spills in-between claps feels like an opening to a Devil May Cry or an Elden Ring type game (if they knew how to pick rap music that is). This is one of the rare occasions where, even for Kendrick Lamar, someone who has always had a good flow on any song, showcases one of his best flows ever. @ somebody you want to debate that with as long as it isnt me. Maybe its the way the bass hits underneath Kendrick saying **fuck** **it** **up**. Maybe its the song structure that sounds more like a two verses with a million bridges in-between. **i made a decision, never give you my feelings, fuck with you from..fuck with you from a distance** is a prime example. The way it feels, its like watching the million man march form person by person as Martin Luther King speaks slowly rising in tone until the entire town can hear him. But Im a pot smoking imagineer dont mind me lol. There is no wasted bar here period. **When you was at your lowest tell me where the hoes was at/when you was at your lowest tell me where the bros was at** is definitely not the typical statement from a rapper on top. This kind of self awareness is present all over the album, but not in the way that you feel youve attended a college lecture, but more like you met a wino who had 4:42 minutes of game from all the mistakes hes made to give you. If you can play this record for day ones and just heard him todays then it his the universal chord. The same reason Micheal Jackson could reach the whole world with just his voice. Rich or poor, i doubt theres a single person who cant relate to **you said id feel better if i just worked hard without lifting my head up/that left me fed up/you made me worry/i wanted my best version but you ignored me/then changed the story/then changed the story/**. Thats the beauty of a talent like Kendrick. Even i made the mistake of counting out Kendrick when my friend told me whenever he comes back the world will listen. This record made me realize i couldnt have been more wrong.

One thing Ive always been curious about, is how Kendrick sees himself. I know how the world does. Ive been a huge J Cole fan long enough to have had one or two conversations about who i think is doing the best from that class. Kendrick was more often than not peoples answer. Ive always had an affinity for risk takers and people who will do an entire project in such an artist fashion that people who dont love music cant enjoy it as much as someone like me. 4 Your Eyez Only comes to mind. Youve heard it a million times. If \_\_\_\_ did that, it would have been the biggest thing the world. It seems like a digression, but its not, because this is why Ive always wondered what does Kendrick think. Sure he did control. But does he really think hes the best out? Or does he hear bars like Big Krits verse on 1 Train and wish he could have did that? ***Crown*** kind of answers that. For better or worse, he acknowledges he wears a crown while saying things like **i cant please everybody**. One of the more shocking statements from an artist who, to me, seems to have done exactly that thus far. Sure, there are people who dont like this album or that album. But everybody has at least one Kendrick album they enjoy, unless they dont enjoy him at all. They are in the minority. **They idolize and praise your name across the nation/tap they feet and nod their head for confirmation/promise that youll keep the music in rotation/thats what i call love** could be taken as a brag, but to me it sounds like hes aware of the double standard. When youre of a certain caliber, people love you. But their love comes with the condition that you produce in the same fashion that you have. Dont believe me? Check out r/FrankOcean when you get a chance. Love without expectations isnt something most people have ever received, let alone given. **Heavy is the head that wears the crown/to whom its given, much is required now** further cements my point. **One thing Ive learned, love can change with the seasons** drills home that he overstands how love works, but he doesnt sound fazed. One thing is for sure from this record, Kendrick sees himself as a king of the game, even if its a reluctant title

***Silent Hill*** reminds me of his earlier works. Mainly the hook reminds me of the love hate relationship i have with similar hooks (Hood Politics was corny at first, but then i came to love it after so many listens). This one, however, i jumped straight to loving. The meticulously placed hard hitting bass might have helped, and maybe its Kendrick finding his pocket constantly in such an esthetically pleasing way, but somehow **pushing them all off me like hhuhhhhh** translates instantly even with the extreme animation. Honestly, even with how i initially receive records like this from, i still think its dope that he does it. This is the one glimpse of kendrick we have constantly gotten, and it goes further back than youd think, Cut You Off being one of the earliest examples i can think of. The animated type hooks should be a signature of his and thats dope because its something he enjoys, not something hes doing to make the most pop record ever. THIS Kodak verse did it for me, definitely one of my favorites. If it wasnt for Baby Keems performance, this would have been my favorite feature even over the Ghostface because it came from someone i didnt expect it. Speaking of Keen&

***Savior (Interlude)*** is my favorite interlude. But its not fair at all, because *The Melodic Blue* was one of my favorite projects that year. So when i heard him going in, i was on board. Its lines like **the engineer dead if the drive dont back up** and **my uncle had told me the shit in the movies could only be magic/this year i did 43 shows, and took it all home, to buy him a casket** that show exactly what i mean when i say Im a fan of his. The former being a reference to the Atlanta episode (this isnt confirmed but i dont care lol it fits too well) when they were in the studio with the Clark county guy? His name escapes me but he made the yoohooo record. They sat as he recorded and as he did a freestyle type verse, the engineer said the computer crashed. Clark then proceeds to say dont crash it again if it crashes again, imma crash my foot in your ass. Mind you, its definitely a technical issue, but thats the hilarity. The program ends up crashing again, where Clark takes a walk and his two goons say yall should go home to Darius and PaperBoi which is the universal sign from one black person to another that some illegal shit is about to go down and yall not gonna want to witness it. The second line is what makes Keem great in his own right, he has a different type of awareness thats just as potent as the one Kendrick has found on this album. The idea that a family member would basically tell you that all the stuff in the movies is make believe, only for you to go out on a world tour that would have made him a believer had he lived to see it. Profound perspective delivered in an entertaining way is Keem.

***Savior*** is another high high undeniably. **Are you happy for me** became one of the questions everybody was asking post this albums release, and rightfully so. He said it best, **Kendrick made you think about it, but he is not you savior** If you didnt notice the cover art, he has a crown of thorns with is a well known reference to the story of Jesuss crucifixion. **One protest for you, 365 for me** is the perfect way to say that if he stands up for something, thats his view now. Whereas a person can protest two opposite ideas and nobody says anything. **Smile in my face, but are you happy for me? Im out the way, are you happy for me** sounds like the response to people who said Kendrick should have been front and center when the world needed him. **see the christians say the vaccine mark of the beast/then he caught COVID and prayed to pfizer for relief/then i caught COVID and started to question Kyrie/will i stay organic or hurt in this bed for two weeks?** is suchhhh a potent line. This is the duality of a lot of americans. I refuse to get political. So many people claimed it was this or that. But when their life was in need, their prayers are altered then and only then. Personally i dont believe in this opinion culture where youre asking basketball players about health policies and rappers about socialism as if thats the source of the best info. 9 times out of 10 you get the same answer youd get if you asked a 40 year long teacher of math only about what happened april 1921 in oklahoma. A good guess, but its not his expertise. **The cat is out the bag, i am not your savior/i find it just as difficult to love thy neighbors** needs no explanation. **the struggle for the right side of history/independent thought is like an eternal enemy/capitalist posing as compassions be offending me/yeah suck my dick with authenticity** captures what i dont think a lot of people understand. We are in a herd mentality time, where if you dont agree with the herd, youre wrong. Youre either good or bad, no in-between. The second half of that line directly made me think back to the pandemic year, when crimes by the cops against minorities were at a high, and every company came out and said we stand with you. Mind you, theyre still supporting the people in power. Mind you, they arent actually throwing their weight around to ensure that black lives matter. No, its easier to say these things because youre selling a product and you want to SEEM progressive. Seem being the operative word as most American companies either have blood or racism all over their hands, or both. Its just hard to trust statements from these companies knowing full well when things die down its back to business as usual. My favorite line from this song is **and they like to wonder where Ive been/protecting my soul, in the valley of silence**

***Auntie Diaries*** is probably one of the most divisive records on the album, if not the most. In the times we are in, everybody is sensitive and nothing can be said. I dont really see how we can ever progress as humanity, if every time somebody does a singular thing we dont like, we shut down and ignore them completely. There was a Dave Chappelle joke about the LBGTQ movement on one of his specials where he compared it to people on a car ride. I wont butcher the joke, but it was brilliant. It even spoke to what some may see as tension with african americans and the LGBTQ movement, but again Im paraphrasing We arent mad at your movement, we admire it because youve gotten so much further than we have in a short time. It basically highlights that whatever movement white people are apart of, gets more traction while we are still fighting for equal treatment across the board. I brought this up to hopefully highlight, even with the best intentions, people can still get offended. This is what Ive found to be the case on this record, as i heard many people shaming him for mixing pronouns or the past tense way he spoke, or even phrases like **my auntie is a man now**, while clearly rooted in him explaining he understands the problems the community faces, as well as taking accountability. While its not pleasing for everybody to hear, there was a period where saying somebody was gay was an insult and people used f\*\*\*\*\* constantly for a number of different reasons. This happened. As much as american loves the my hands are clean now approach, the fact still remains a lot of those things were not that long ago. I loved this record because it was an honest discussion on how we saw it from his point of view, and how hes changed. But the world sees records like this as tone deaf. Makes me think back to a coment I made recently. If we censor the Dave Chappelles, what can we expect from further generations but more Kevin Hart?

***Mr. Morale*** contains my second favorite flow for the entire album. The records where Kendricks rapping ability overshadows what he talked about are almost non existent on this album, which while thats refreshing, i also appreciate a silent hill or mr morale existing on such a heavy album. shit on my mind and its heavy/tell you in pieces cuz its way too heavy captures that idea exactly. When you add in lines like transformation, i must had a thousand lives and like 3 thousand wives the picture is clear. Honestly, that could have been the tag line for the entire album, because as this is still the Kendrick we have come to know from a distance over the years, this is the first up close view of his life. It would seem that in the years in-between he went through some hyperbolic time chamber to exponentially increase all his stats in a small amount of time. While he does touch on subjects that are lesser known, the next track is a much more concise journal of those

***Mother I Sober*** is probably the one track that captures everything that Kendrick has been through both before fame, during, and after DAMN. I would basically have to paste every lyric to really capture the depth here, but lines like y**ou havent felt grief until you felt it sober** and then the flip **you havent felt guilt until you felt it sober** punctuate the verses they come from. Truly not a song to be spoiled until you hear the way Kendrick delivers it, its the ultimate example of a song changing your life and perspective even if its just heard once. I, on the other hand gravitate to this album because Ive had so many similar experiences, this song is like a silent last course for an album completely based in being food for thought. **I wish I was somebody, anybody but myself** could not resonate more with me. Kendrick did what he hasnt before with this album to me, and after I discuss mirror Ill explain

***Mirror*** is my favorite record. Its the first record I ever wanted to replay, from literally my first listen I doubled back a few times before hearing the album. I choose me is undeniably one of the most powerful lyrics. I can only speak from experience, and after battling depression and dealing with never truly wanting to be who I was, I finally learned that I had to choose me. I had to make an effort to maintain my sanity above all else. You can be super giving, but you have to know when youre on 5% and dont have any battery to share. The hook is the most simple of the entire album outside of Silent Hill, yet for the purpose of a hook being something youd want to repeat, **I choose me Im sorry** is the highest on the list for me. I found myself grooving in traffic multiple times like I was at a jazz concert with the green incense burning. With some of the final bars of the album, Kendrick doesnt miss saying **I cant live in the matrix/rather fall short of your graces/this time I wont trade places/not about whos right whos wrong/evolve the only known/ask me when Im coming home/blink twice and then Im gone**. This hits hard for me because to me Kendrick has always did music from someone elses perspective. Hes aware of it, and saying this time I cant do that. I choose me. **You wont grow old waiting on me** is another direct response to people demanding his time and presence. Not one to miss the moment, he even has choice words for hip hop herself when he says **She told me she need me the most, I didn't believe her/she even called me names on the post, the world can see it/jokes and gaslightin'/mad at me 'cause she didn't get my vote, she say I'm trifflin/disregardin' the way that I cope with my own vices/maybe, it's time to break it off/runaway from the culture to follow my heart**. Its especially profound that someone would come off a hiatus, to put people back on notice that you just might not be as into it as you were. Hes not saying flat out hes gonna stop, and most likely he has a couple more albums in him before he stops, but its one of the most interesting things said on on the album. It makes you wonder was Kendrick on a break because of x, y or z, or was he testing the waters with stopping all together?

So one of my original points was that I related to this album more than any other Kendrick album. I touched on why randomly here and there, but the main point is that before, all of his albums felt like they were about something or for specific people. You never truly got a view into Kendricks inner workings outside of a bar here or there, or songs like u, so he always had this mystique. If I met Kendrick then, Id probably have referred to him as k. dot or something informal. Thats not to say I didnt like his albums, quite the contrary. TPAB is perfection. But, for me, when I hear an artist being vulnerable and baring all, thats what I relate to the most. Not Jay Z Dirt Off Your Shoulders, but Song Cry or Regrets. I dont have to agree with your every take. For me its just like when you meet somebody. Im not that invested. But once you tell me youre into Star Wars we can have a whole conversation before I realize its been a couple hours. So to me, that makes this the number one album in his discography. If I saw him at the airport, Ill probably say yoooo Kendrick you killed that album! Lol because it feels like he let me into his Tuesday and Thursday therapy session. Which means Kendrick took the pressure, and still found a way to add more layers without disappointing. Which is honestly all we can ask after a long hiatus right? Growth

My brother married this bridezilla last year.

This is a bit long but please bear with me. I will need to start the story with the events that happened 2 years ago.

The wedding should've been 2 years earlier and would have been held in our country but the pandemic happened so they had to reschedule it.

To make this easier let's call the bridezilla, ""Anna"".

Anna was nice to us in the beginning. I only met her once and have been on video calls with her since I am always busy with my job.

When she got comfortable with us, she started to ask us to do some errands for her (to be able to 'help' her and my brother).

The first thing she did was ask my sister to look for wedding decorations and produce wedding invitations and souvenirs according to her desired 'plans'. I am not that aware of what she wants but my sister told me that the materials she wants are very expensive. My sis gave her an estimate and she told her to look for 'cheaper' alternatives. This will go on for weeks and shes not even giving my sister some allowance for petrol. She also wants everything done as soon as possible (like we have no other stuff to do but serve her).

My sister informed me that Anna is kind of a slavedriver. After some time, she asked me to make blueprints for her dream house. I am a busy person that works for a minimum of 12 hrs a day (because of deadlines). I told her this and politely refused the offer to build plans for her. I recommended a trusted friend that can help her with it and was willing to give a discount on the plans. He quoted about $2000 for the plans which are cheaper by $200 (we are from a 3rd world country so it might be too cheap for others) compared to others. She said that it was too much and tried to look for someone else that can do it cheaper.

After that, she rarely communicates with me. After a few months, I heard from my sister that Anna and her architect friend (who 'made' the plans) is talking shit behind my back. Saying that I am ""worthless"" and ""wasted"" my degree in engineering just because I wasn't able to help her with the plans. She probably thought I can give her plans for free too since she's my brother's fiancé. 

They ended up asking my cousin to work on the plans but my cousin discovered that the architectural plans Anna's friend provided were a copy of someone else's work (they literally just changed the title block) so my cousin ended up giving up on that job too.

After a few months, the wedding was rescheduled and since my brother is busy with his work, he will only be able to have 2 weeks off for the wedding. Anna got livid! She forced my brother to go on an extended leave without the employer's approval (meaning he could lose his job). Since she wants to be able to go visit other countries for their honeymoon.

They decided to get married in South Africa. Since Anna isn't earning much, my brother probably ended up paying for everything. But since they recently bought properties, his money is not enough to bring the family with them. Instead, they will only be able to bring the parents and Anna's child. 

Anna wasn't able to provide the necessary documents to be able to get her child's passport though so only my mom and her mom were able to attend the wedding.

My brother provided my mom $2000 allowance so she can buy the stuff she wanted when they arrive. My mom was with them for 2-3 months (mostly at Anna's place). 

After a few weeks, I found out that my mom is going home by herself and that they took her allowance so Anna's sister and her child can go visit other countries too. 

I am okay with my mom going early though since we missed her and she did tell me once that she wants to go home early but she didn't spend much of the money since she was saving it for a few renovations in the house. 

Everything is fine until I found out from my sister that Anna was not feeding my mom properly during their stay at her place (my brother had to leave sometimes since he need to work to be able to recover from the wedding expenses). So while my mom was staying with Anna and her own mother, she would never ask my mom to eat. My mom is very shy and wouldn't get food on her own unless offered. This is a common thing in our country (Anna is aware of this). So then, my mom will only be able to eat when Annas mother offers her food. 

My mom wasn't able to buy her own food too since they took away her allowance as mentioned earlier. Also, Anna has a vibe that she doesn't like people going through her stuff so my mother doesn't look for food in the fridge or pantry.

When they eat out, Anna would ask her mom what she wants and buys it for her. As for my mom, she would pick the cheapest food they have and would not even ask my mother's preference (my mom is not that adventurous when it comes to food and doesnt eat something thats spicy). It's a good thing that we have relatives in that country so there are times that my mother would visit them so she can eat properly.

The bitch also doesnt eat the same food twice a day. If theres leftover food (even if its still good/edible) she would throw it in the trash. Not to mention, she always goes fine dining even if she doesnt earn that much.  
She has also a fear of missing out. Our family loves dogs so she got one too. Poor baby was kept inside a small cage for almost 24hrs a day. She lives alone with the dog so when shes at work and the dog is inside the cage, the dog got so stressed that it started to eat its own sh\*t. Looking at her photos with the dog inside the cage in the background made me think she doesnt care about the poor thing at all. She then gave the dog away (which is a good thing since I heard the dog is getting along well with the new fur parents). Its sad that the dog had to go through a lot of stress though.

My brother and Anna have been married for a year now. I am surprised that he was able to survive. Anyways, I think hes at fault too since he spoiled her so much. He cant say no to her demands. On top of the real estate properties they purchased, he even got her a ride. He told us that Anna paid for it but I doubt that she can afford that on her own (considering the lavish lifestyle she currently has that doesnt match her income).  
My family treat her right every time she comes over to stay at our house for days. Mom cooks her whatever she likes. I really dont get why she had to treat my mom and sister like that.","bridezillas",514,514,0,0.96,0,0,0,48

This is not to discredit very important shortages occurring... it's to highlight one more aspect.

Things to consider:

1. Existing concerns: [There](https://www.eatthis.com/news-grocery-shortages-baby-and-pet-food/) are [murmurs](https://www.petfoodindustry.com/blogs/7-adventures-in-pet-food/post/11087-pet-food-not-immune-to-global-crises-and-issues) about certain brands of [pet foods](https://www.fox29.com/news/canned-pet-food-shortage-continues-amid-supply-chain-woes) disappearing as we speak, and this is only the beginning. It will happen before we know it.

2. Foresight and Prioritization: The Baby Formula shortage is an eye opener. Although this was caused by unrelated circumstances and a single plant closing over contamination issues, the lack of oversight by the FDA is [alarming](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/05/25/baby-formula-shortage-abbott-hearing/). If they don't have the foresight to protect infants, we can be sure all else is not a priority.

3. Alternatives strained: In addition to the shortage of wheat, there will also be a strain on other grain products, as substitutes will be sought to fill the gaps for humans or fields abandoned for wheat. For example, a shortage of [beer and popcorn](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-19/shortages-of-beer-sriracha-popcorn-hit-by-supply-chain-crisis) are currently next in line, as corn and barley are abandoned. This will limit the availability of all ingredients for dog and cat food.

4. Timeline: The wheat collapse is estimated the last week of July. Start preparing now.

If we do experience a petfood shortage, things you can replace in the short term to feed both you and your pet: bulk white rice, canned protein like tuna or chicken, potatoes... 

Edited to add great suggestions from the comments with long shelf life: Canned pumpkin, carrots, corn, green beans, Oatmeal

Keep things plain and avoid high sodium items. Stock up on these things for yourself, and you can share with your pet just in case. Looking for any other suggestions.

Despite husband and I having 0 children, not pregnant, nor planning on having children in the near future, MIL still manages to bring her future grandchildren into the conversation once again. At some point along the way we get onto the topic of newborn rules and things we plan/hope to do once we have a baby. To which I bring up how I do not want anyone kissing my newborn for the first several months of life. 

Thinking this is a very standard expectation when meeting new babies, you can only imagine my surprise when MIL sucks all of the oxygen from the room, clutches her pearls, and lets out the most dramatic and ear piercing yipe from the other end of the table. What?! You want to do what?! WHY!! I have NEVER heard of that! - in the most I know everything because I am a mom kind of tone. To which I begin to explain the risks of hospitalization to a newborn with 0 immune system and am again cut off by,  well I guess I just wont see the baby for the first few months then. As she crosses her arms, rocks back in her chair, and gives that awkward little guilty smile. 

As a background, I am a damn nurse midwife. I was previously a baby nurse in the hospital and also have a masters in childhood development psych. So not only have I seen infants in the ICU due to a kiss from grandma, but I damn well know about it as well. Im kinda an expert in taking care of infants and children and dont need the outdated advice from someone who thinks that because shes raised two children she knows everything there is about newborn health and wellness. 

This might also be a good place to add that this gem of a woman would have Covid exposures during the height of the pandemic and would still attend family dinners with GPIL, despite them being immunocompromised and terrified of Covid at the time. She never even told them she had an exposure, she would just pretend it never happened. So yeah Im a bit concerned when it comes to her kissing my newborn because I know she wouldnt reschedule if she were sick. 

Anyway, I ended up calling her bluff and saying that it was fine, she didnt have to come if she didnt feel comfortable. She didnt like the response but she shut up and it hasnt been brought up again since. 

If youve got advice Ill take it, but otherwise I guess its comforting to know that these MILs will always think they know more than you, no matter what credentials you have =D.","JUSTNOMIL",507,507,0,0.99,1,0,0,138

Hello again, r/hobbydrama! I have too much time on my hands once more, so here's another obscenely long history hobby deep dive. I already explained who most of the relevant people are in my first post, so this time I'll just get right into it, starting from the top with some additional petty bullshit.

#Additional Petty Bullshit 

**The Amalasuintha Problem**

[Amalasuintha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalasuintha) was the ruler of the Ostrogoths from 526 to around 536. She acted as regent for her son, Athalaric, who was about ten years old when he inherited the crown. Athalaric died young in 535, and Amalasuintha tried to stay in power afterwards, but she was quickly assassinated by her cousin Theodahad, whom she had made her co-ruler. In life, Amalasuintha had had a close diplomatic relationship with Justinian, so he used her death as an excuse to declare war on the Ostrogoths and invade Italy (which hed been wanting to do for a while anywayrestoring the empire was his whole deal, after all.) 

In fiction, Amalasuintha is kind of a murky character. A lot of authors assume that her *marrying* Justinian was on the cards at some point, and I have no idea whether this was actually the case historically (probably not), but its practically a given in novels about her, because its dramatic and because it sets the stage for a nice little Betty-and-Veronica love triangle: will Justinian pick the pious, wealthy, well-educated foreign queen whose hand in marriage could grant him access to Italy diplomatically, or the bold, sexy, alluring ex-actress with a storied past who brings no money or political connections to the table? Did *Theodora* kill Amalasuintha out of fear that the Ostrogoth queen would sabotage her relationship for political gain? Historically accurate or not, the sheer drama of it all is unmatched. 

Whether Amalasuintha herself is a sympathetic character varies a lot. Stories focusing on Belisarius tend to make her a bit of an asshole (if they discuss her at all), generally because the author wants the audience focusing on the cool military stuff happening during the wars in Italy and not on the death of the woman whose assassination was the conflicts catalyst. After all, if you make Amalasuintha too nice, people are going to be sad about her inevitable murder, and if youre trying to write a fun military epic, you dont want that. Stories centering on Theodora usually do the same, with the caveat that they tend to emphasize Amalasuinthas privileged background and intellectual failings more than anythingwho better to contrast the ruthlessly efficient ex-prostitute Theodora, who spent a pandemics worth of time eliminating threats to her power while Justinian lay comatose, than a Gothic princess who was ultimately killed by her own co-ruler? Not all stories take this route, though. Half-realized dreams and impossible ambitions are recurring themes in works about Justinian, and some of them list his failure to protect Amalasuintha from being murdered, or his decision to marry a not-very-politically-advantageous commoner like Theodora, as among the first of his many regrets. This is, admittedly, a stretch; theres no indication that Justinian ever regretted marrying Theodora or that he carried a torch for Amalasuintha (wouldnt Procopius have mentioned it if that was the case?). But, again, the rule of drama wins out in the end. And casting Amalasuintha as Justinians long-dead first love whom he failed to save is definitely dramatic. 

In any case, one thing is certain about Amalasuintha: Justinian/Theodora shippers *hate* her. Even when shes portrayed sympathetically, the shippers are always standing on the sidelines, rooting for her death. If she actually wins out in the endwhich happens in a number of alternate history storiestheyll riot, *especially* if the author kills Theodora off or otherwise gives her a hard time. Even stories that give Amalasuntha and Justinian a loveless arranged marriage and let Theodora live in luxury as the emperors beloved mistress still fall victim to shipper fury, though. Their ire extends to other members of Amalasuinthas family, too; her daughter Matasuintha, who wound up marrying Justinians cousin Germanus, is also subject to Ron-the-Death-Eater-style character assassination (granted, some of this is compounded by the general seething hatred this part of the fandom feels for Germanuss family, which is its own mess.) Guy Gavriel Kays Sarantine Mosaic duology (which is more or less an alternate history book where the names are changed) probably wouldve been beloved by the fandom if it werent for the fact that Amalasuinthas expy, Gisel of Bataria, gets a happy ending (she doesnt even hook up with the Justinian character, she just doesnt die!). Theres also an asteroid named after Amalasuintha, so people hate the asteroid, too. Like, theyll sit there and complain about its eccentricity and orbital period and so on. 

(Also, sidenote: there are about fifty million different ways to spell Amalasuintha. Wikipedia lists Amalasuentha, Amalaswintha, Amalasuntha, Amalswinthe, Amalasontha, Amalasiuntha, and Amalsenta, and Im sure there are more. No matter which one you go with, I can guarantee someone will be mad about it and tell you that its wrong. Amalasuintha versus Amalasuntha in particular has caused an insane amount of discourse.) 

**Questionable Crossovers** 

There are a truly astonishing amount of Harry Potter fics featuring Justinian and Theodora, some of which have actually leeched into the mainstream a little bit (I wont link them, you can probably find them if you go hunting for them but please dont harass the authors.) Sometimes various Harry Potter characters are portrayed as their reincarnations or descendants, usually for shipping reasonssome pureblood character is related to Justinian, some muggle-born character is related to Theodora, and their ancestry/soul bond/whatever is used to justify their interclass relationship and/or out-of-character devoted love for one another (dont think too hard about this, it literally never makes any sense.) Other fics have Justinian and Theodora themselves show up as characters, sometimes minor and sometimes major (theres a fic where Theodora invents one of the Forbidden Curses.) This *always* results in heated debates over what their Hogwarts houses would be (Justinian is usually a Slytherin because ambition, Belisarius is usually a Gryffindor because bravery and loyalty, and Theodora is usually a Ravenclaw because scheming, but this is by no means universal) and whether these very Christian historical figures would have approved of witchcraft (probably not.) 

To a lesser extent, all of these people appear occasionally in Percy Jackson fanfiction, typically that which involves time travel. Theodora is frequently portrayed as a daughter of Aphrodite, Belisarius is usually the son of a war god (whether its Ares or Athena depends on how much the author likes him; its Athena if they do and Ares if they dont) and Justinian has, like, a 50/50 chance of being a demigod or just an average loser whos in way over his head. Again, this results in debates over whether their headcanoned godly parentages are right and whether these very Christian historical figures would have appreciated being portrayed as the children of pagan gods (and the answer is, again, probably not.) 

**Justinians fucked up junk**

This is also going to require a bit of context. 

So: Justinian and Theodora never had any children together. Theodora had an illegitimate (well, out-of-wedlock, at least; some sources say she was either legitimized at some point or basically treated as legitimate anyway) daughter, and I have seen people claim that this kid was actually Justinians somehow, but I dont think theres any real evidence for that. Ive also seen articles claim that Theodora did get pregnant with Justinians child at some point, but she miscarried or had a stillbirth, or the baby died in infancy. In any case, there were no surviving children born in the purple during their reign, although they certainly tried their bestthere are plenty of records of Theodora seeking fertility advice from various spiritual and medical authorities, and none of it ever working. That on its own is kind of sad, but, of course, this isnt just the story of one couple desperately wanting a baby and being unable to have one; remember, these people were royalty, so the fact that Justinian never had a son was a Problem. He wound up passing the throne to his nephew, Justin II, whose reign was an unmitigated disastergranted, there were a lot of reasons for that, mostly the aftereffects of the wars and the plague and whatnot, but Justin himself was a bit of a hot mess too, to put it lightly. So what would have happened had Justinian and Theodora managed to conceive a son of their own is the subject of much alternate history speculation. That, combined with the amount of personal and political melodrama authors can milk from the obligatory Infertility Arc"", means that these long-dead monarchs reproductive organs live rent-free in a lot of peoples minds.

Most sources from the time period, as well as many only *slightly* more modern novels, pin all the blame on Theodora, alleging that her, uh, acting prevented her from having any more children after the illegitimate son and daughter she might have maybe had. A lot of this clearly stems more from slut-shaming than anything else, but from a medical standpoint, it *kinda* checks outbeing a prostitute in an era before condoms, STD tests, safe abortions, antibiotics, or the basic concept of washing your hands existed seems like the kind of thing that could screw with a womans ability to carry a pregnancy to term, especially when you consider how young Theodora mustve been for a lot of this. But thats far from the only possible explanation, and more recent authors tend to at least lend credence to the theory that the problem might have laid with Justinian instead (if they dont just handwave the whole issue as something unknowable.) Some writers mention the fact that Justin I never had any children, either, so readers can speculate if it was some kind of genetic thing. Others& do not stay that vague. 

To be more specific, some authors blame Justinians lack of an heir on some undescribed-by-historians medical issue involving his reproductive system, which they invariably pause the narrative to describe in grueling detail. They will devote entire passages to things like gross hematospermia, or testicular torsion, or unexplained lumps and lesions of all kinds. Its happened in fanfiction, but its a real-world phenomenon, too; there are multiple actual, published novels in which the plot grinds to a halt so the writer can include a penis problem subplot. Its a whole thing. Naturally, its inspired a lot of memes, as well as a debate about the true cause of Justinian and Theodoras infertility (which obviously never gets resolved, because both of these people died 1500 years ago having never learned of modern medicine.) 

**Byzantium! The Musical**

Since the dawn of *Hamilton,* historical fiction fans and theater kids alike have been speculating about which other historical figures could potentially carry another showstopping musical, and Theodora, for better or worse, is often at the top of the list. Some of this is clearly just history geeks shoehorning their blorbo-from-their-textbooks into whatever they can, but admittedly, Theodora does meet all of the prerequisitesshes got the love story, the drama, the rags-to-riches climb to power, the worksplus her actual career as an actress should, in theory, lend itself nicely to a biographical musical. Every so often, someone pops up with a big, spectacular idea about a Theodora Show, everyone asks omg, why havent they made this yet? and then it disappears into the aether again because the people proposing it rarely have any musical ability or theater expertise that would enable them to get such a production off the ground. And then, invariably, someone pops up to say that actually, they *did* make a Theodora Musical, at which point the drama starts.

There have actually been a surprising number of off-off-off-Broadway shows about the Byzantine Empire (I counted at *least* six while researching for this post, four of which were about Theodora) but theyre all extremely obscure and mostly forgotten (although I should mention that there was a famous Theodora-centric play written in the 1800s, which the fandom generally ignores for a host of reasons related to inaccessibility, shipping, and historical inaccuracy.) *Byzantium: The Musical* has the dubious distinction of being *slightly* less obscure and forgotten than the others, but that isnt saying much. *Byzantium* debuted in 2005 at the New York Fringe Festival and seemingly has not been performed since. Information about it is scarce; the show apparently wasnt recorded in any capacity, there are very few photos of the production, the website has been down since 2007 and most of it wasnt archived by the Wayback Machine, and the music was based on a concept album that seems to have vanished off the face of the Earth. There are a handful of surviving reviews for it, though, and theyre& uh. Theyre a lot.

From what I can gather, the musicals main plot centered on Justinian and Theodoras famous forbidden-love romance, with an additional subplot in which Justinian scrambles to avoid an arranged marriage to a fictional foreign princess. Belisarius and Antonina appear in some capacity, too, although their roles seem to have been comparatively minor. Most of the reviews were not  positive; critics noted the unimaginative music, the poor choreography, and some of the singers flat voices (although I kind of feel bad repeating those criticisms having never listened to the soundtrack or seen the show myself, to be honest.) Critics also noted some weirder problems, though. Like the leather, which there was apparently a lot of (what does that mean? I do not know.) Oh, and the *repeated references to 9/11.* Pretty much every review mentions how Justinian constantly spouted catchphrases associated with the War on Terror and talked about various military campaigns as if they were wars against radical Islamic terrorists (something which makes no sense for a lot of reasons, but mainly because Islam just flat-out didnt exist yet during Justinians reign.) Im probably making this play sound god-awful, but it does seem to have been more of a you love it or hate it kind of thing than what the reviews suggesta couple of people who actually saw it have lauded it as a campy, hilarious, deliberately ridiculous extravaganza that critics took too seriously. 

In any case, regardless of its actual quality, *Byzantium! The Musical* is remembered todaynearly 20 years after its debutfor two reasons. A.) a post-9/11 Justinian/Theodora romance musical just *sounds* insane, and nobody knows enough about this long-dead show to provide any more context than that, so people repeat it because its funny. And, B.) the existence of this show *really* aggravates the more annoying Belisarius fanboys, who *hate* that their Sigma Male icon was reduced to something as *silly and pedestrian* as being a supporting character in an off-off-off-off-Broadway musical about his bosss love story. Ill elaborate on Belisariuss fandom in a hot second, but all you need to know right now is that a lot of it consists of the absolute worst type of military history enthusiastalt-right-adjacent, homophobic weirdos. They do not like Broadway in general, and they *really* dont like picturing the guy they hero-worship belt a romantic duet on stage. Therefore, *Byzantium!* is the perfect material to get them riled up. Mentioning it offhandedly can instantly derail any discussion by inciting arguments over Belisariuss manliness and whether theater as a medium is inherently un-manly, during which the rest of the fandom pops popcorn and watches from a safe distance. 

**Other Miscellaneous Nonsense** 

Some other random bullshit I came across:

- **Other Theodoras.** There were about a dozen Byzantine women named Theodora. Theodora alone almost always refers to this Theodora, wife of Justinian I, but there were a bunch of others: Theodora Porphyrogenitas, empress and autocrat; Theodora of Khazaria, wife of Justinian II Rhinotmetus (this was not a coincidence, he made her change her name so theyd match the first Justinian and Theodora); Theodora the Blessed, Theodora Palaiologina, and thats only the tip of the iceberg. Naturally, people mix them up *all the time,* and it causes a shitstorm whenever it happens.

- **John.** Procopius accused Theodora of having an illegitimate son named John, whom she allegedly abandoned, mistreated, and hid from Justinian. This is a suspect claim; it isnt mentioned by anyone but Procopius, and most sources I checked seem to agree that the story as relayed in the Anecdota was probably nothing but another rumor spread by those who disliked Theodoras past. Nonetheless, John appears often in books about Theodora, which tend to include complex intrigue subplots about disguising him, granting him power, and/or questioning whether hes an imposter. This always incites debates about whether John existed and whether Theodora was a good mother.

- **Theodora: Slave Empress.** *Theodora: Slave Empress* is the name of a 1954 sword-and-sandal romance movie *very* loosely based on Theodoras life. Its funny for a lot of reasons: John the Cappadocian is the villain and half of his motivation comes from his jealousy at Justinians handsomeness, theres a chariot-racing scene in which Theodora is clearly wearing a modern construction helmet with a visible logo on it, everyone kind of looks like a wax sculpture because of bad lighting and makeup, theres a scene where Justinian throws a javelin into someones chest from across the room like an Olympic athlete, and a good chunk of the plot revolves around it isnt what it looks like! rom-com miscommunication. Nevertheless, the scene where Justinian kisses Theodora on the balcony made it into a YouTube compilation of the most romantic old movie kisses, and from there, it spread to TikTok. This led to kids on TikTok thinking that Justinian and Theodora were made-up fictional characters invented for an old period drama, like Jack and Rose in *Titanic.* 

- **Age gap discourse.** Justinian was about two decades older than Theodora, and Antonina was similarly older than Belisarius. Of course, theres age-gap discourse about it, even though all of these people were adults when they met (and I mean adults by modern standards, not oh its cool because she wouldve been considered an adult back then standards.) For some reason, a lot of books age Antonina down so that shes younger than her husband while simultaneously leaving Justinian and Theodoras twenty-year age gap intact (or making it even widershe was probably in her late twenties when they got married, but Ive seen stories make her as young as 18.) This never goes down well in the fandom, both because its creepy and because a lot of people like the idea of MILF Antonina. 

Okay. Now that the dumb stuff is sorted,

#Oh. Right. The Nazis. 

Unfortunately, at this point, it should go without saying that most online communities dedicated to discussion about Rome are going to have an alt-right problem. Fascists are *obsessed* with Greco-Roman culture, and have been for a very long timehell, its even [in the name](https://www.britannica.com/topic/fasces). There are a few reasons for this, one being that these people tend to interpret Rome as very white, very male, and very superior to every other civilization thats ever existed, generally depicting it as a kind of metaphorical dam holding back the tide of the Dark Ages. This is not a super accurate view of Rome, obviouslyyou have to ignore actual Roman viewpoints on sexuality, race, and ethnicity, the many contributions of Greek and Roman women, and all of the advancements of the so-called Dark Ages in order to make it workbut it persists nonetheless. A lot of alt-right rhetoric makes claims about cultural decline that draw intentional similarities to the fall of Rome, painting various ethnic groups as invading barbarians trying to drag a perfect society into ruin. In the past, the majority of this obsession has focused on the West, but as of late, things have been getting, well... a little more Byzantine. There are many reasons for this, which Ive conveniently gathered into a list:

**Religion** 

Heres the thing about Byzantium: it *was* Rome, but Christian. This was especially true in the centuries immediately following Western Romes collapse when the old Empire was still within living memory and leaders like Justinian saw reconquering that territory as a real possibility. So if you dont like pagans and their icky Jesus-wasnt-born-yet religious beliefs, but you still want to use the iconography and rhetoric associated with Rome, the earliest few centuries of the Byzantine Empire check all of your boxes. 

Compounding the religion issue is the fact that Justinian and Theodora publicly disagreed with one another on certain religious topics, specifically on the divine nature of Christ. Im not going to get into specifics here because early Christian theological discourse is complicated as Hell, but the gist is that Justinian was Orthodox and Theodora was a Monophysitein other words, Theodora was a hereticand they were pretty open about their differences in opinion. This, of course, has resulted in Discourse (not between Justinian and Theodora, weirdly, but between literally everyone else from the sixth century AD to 2023.) Theres discourse over whether Theodora was actually a Monophysite or whether she was just faking it for political gain. Theres discourse over whether Justinian should have tolerated her pro-Monophysite scheming. Theres discourse over whether Justinian himself was secretly a Monophysite, too (he did convert to an extreme form of Monophystism a year before his death, but its unclear whyand Theodora cant be blamed for it, because shed been dead for decades by then.) Theres discourse over whether Theodora and her promotion of heresy single-handedly destroyed the world. Some of the arguments have some basis in history, even tangentially (Procopius does claim that Justinian and Theodora occasionally pretended to be at odds with one another to uncover plots against them or orchestrate certain schemes, only to reveal that theyd been in cahoots the whole time once they accomplished what they wanted.) Others are clearly ahistorical nonsense dreamed up by various religious sects who want to either claim Justinian and/or Theodora as their own or villanize one or both of them (usually Theodora the former prostitute is the easier target.) This religious discourse therefore ends up attracting religious extremists who can argue for forty days and forty nights about every Christian heresy under the sun. 

Aside from your bog-standard Chalcedonian-versus-Monophysite drama, though, theres also Pope Silverius drama. Pope Silverius was a sixth-century pope who was deposed in a plot that Theodora, Belisarius, and Antonina all seemingly had some level of involvement in; he was relatively pro-Goth, and they wanted to replace him with someone more pro-Byzantium. Silverius is a pretty obscure figure, and I doubt many people would care about him if it werent for the fact that Byzantine-obsessed tradcathsTraditional Catholics, essentially Catholic fundieshave *really* connected to his story, in large part because it validates their batshit opinions about Pope Francis. 

The thing about tradcaths is that theyre generally sedevacantists, meaning that they believe the Holy See is vacant and Francis is not the real Popethe real Pope being the now-recently-deceased Pope Emeritus Benedict, who retired from the papacy at 85 and who was not murdered. Map Silverius onto Benedict, and Vigilushis successoronto Francis, and boom! You have a nonsensical metaphor about the government murdering a good Pope and replacing him with an evil Antipope, which aligns conveniently with the beliefs tradcaths hold about Francis and his policies, and which gives them a convenient excuse to blame the state of the world on Theodora, the abortionist whore (despite their involvement, Belisarius and Antonina never seem to get as much flack as Theodora; Antonina is too obscure and Belisarius too well-liked, and again, the former prostitute is the easiest target.) 

**Plague**

As Ive mentioned before, this period of history was marked not only by ambitious legal reforms and reconquests, but also *constant* natural disasters, including a plague pandemic. And, unless you have been living under one hell of a rock for the past three years, there is an ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

Now, COVID-19 and the plague are not remotely similar aside from the fact that theyre both dangerous diseases that can kill youSARS-CoV-2 and *Yersinia pestis* are two totally different organisms with totally different transmission methods, and the cultural and scientific landscape looked *vastly* different in 541 versus today. But people love comparing the two pandemics, and they also love dreaming up braindead hot takes to go with those comparisons.

One endless well of drama is the ongoing debate about whether Theodora would have supported the use of a plague vaccine, if she had known what bacteria or vaccines or germ theory were. Whats funny about this debate is that most people seem to agree on the verdictthat, yes, Theodora would have supported the use of a plague vaccine, if it existed and she knew the underlying biologybut not on whether thats a good or a bad thing. On one hand, youve got people saying that, yes, Theodora would have been happy to have a vaccine, because the plague was a huge miserable catastrophe for the whole empire and she was probably pretty upset when her husband, whom she seemingly loved, contracted it and nearly died. On the other hand, the tradcaths and other alt-right groups argue that Theodora would have supported the vaccine for selfish reasons because vaccines are evil Death Jabs and Theodora was an evil baby-murdering abortionist who had sex sometimes and allegedly enjoyed it. Most of the arguments about Theodoras stance on the vaccine were thinly-veiled debates about the COVID jabthe vast majority of the participants didnt actually believe that this woman who lived and died without ever learning what a bacterium is would have a strong opinion about the matter either way. But debating Theodoras theoretical stance on a theoretical vaccine for a plague that happened hundreds of years ago allowed them to effectively debate COVID without actually debating COVID, so there you go.

**Incels**

Ive said multiple times throughout this two-parter that Belisarius is very popular with self-described sigma males and that sort of manosphere crowd. Belisarius himself isnt really at fault for this; to my knowledge, theres no evidence that he had particularly disgusting opinions about women or anything (I mean, he did live in sixth-century Europe, but you know what I meantheres nothing to indicate that he was uniquely awful given the time period. In fact, hes generally seen as a pretty standup guy.) Its more like his life story is easy to dramatize in a way that a certain type of person tends to connect with. Belisarius is seen as an underappreciated genius who cant catch a breakhes too intelligent, too manly, and too good at his job, so Justinian envies him, and he never finds the success he could have achieved under a better emperor.  Meanwhile, his gold-digging wife cheats on him constantly even though hes basically the worlds most perfect man, but he has to stay married to her, because shes best friends with the empress, whos also a crazy bitch, and theyre always scheming against him for nebulous reasons, because women and their petty jealousies are impossible to comprehend. He remains loyal to the end, but that loyalty never gets rewarded, and hes ultimately blinded/killed/exiled, all because he was too good at everything. Truly a travesty for the ages.

Again, thats not a super realistic view of the real historythe myth that he was blinded and exiled probably isnt even truebut its dramatic, so it persists the same way Amalasuintha/Justinian romance persists. And that combination of too smart for everyone and bitch wife is mean because women like abusing nice guys appeals very strongly to incels and incel-esque corners of the internet, to whom Belisarius is a patron saint. (Not that hes actually a saint. Justinian and Theodora are canonized saints in Eastern Orthodoxy, Belisarius is not. People get very mad about that, too.) So Belisarius has a decently-sized following of resentful manchildren who believe the world is against them and they cant find a partner/a job/personal fulfillment because theyre Too Smart and they Know Too Muchthink, like, the guys who made straight Cs in high school and claimed that it was because the classes were too easy and boring for them to focus properly. You know the type. 

Every time a new piece of media comes out that portrays any Byzantine in any capacity, they come out of the woodworks to throw tantrums about Belisariusif Justinian and Theodora and *especially* Antonina are portrayed positively, they get obscenely angry, because those people may or may not have done shitty things to Belisarius, and therefore discussing their accomplishments is a disservice to him. Books that focus specifically on Theodora tend to get the brunt of the criticism: they typically shine the spotlight on Theodora and Justinians achievements almost exclusively while pushing Belisariuss military stuff to the background, which is strike one; they often feature Antonina prominently and make her into a sympathetic character, which is strike two; and they usually discuss womens rights, prostitution, and sex trafficking to some degree, which is strike three (these people almost invariably have bad opinions about women, so the idea that a woman like Theodora could have sex with multiple partnerslet alone *sell* sex to multiple partnersand then go on to have a happy marriage with a wealthy, high-value man is naturally going to drive them away, especially when theres an additional subplot in which she influences legislation that allows other women to do the same thing and have more personal rights and freedoms to boot.) They also like to antagonize shippersshippers in general, but most importantly Theodora/Antonina shippers, whose stories usually involve a sympathetic portrayal of Antoninas affairs. They havent caused any enormous scandals other than generic Very Online Manosphere bitching about women, fan ships, and whether Belisarius was the Sigma to Justinians Beta Male, but its relevant to the overall drama that theres this constant undercurrent of Belisarius fanboys whose views overlap heavily with those of incels. 

**Making Byzantium Great Again** 

Ill cut right to the chase with this one: People like to draw comparisons between Justinian I and Donald Trump. A lot.

On the surface, this seems insane. Thats because it *is* insane. But the two do share some superficial similarities: Justinians whole restoring-the-empire-to-greatness deal *kinda* lines up with Trumps MAGA ambitions, and then theres COVID-19 and the Justinian Plague, and Trumps whole marriage to Melania that would sort of be like Justinians marriage to Theodora, if Theodora was his third wife and much less interesting and if they didnt really like each other all that much. So people that admire Trump like to compare him to Justinian, who, for all his controversies, is still considered a mostly-successful emperor who achieved quite a lot. There are a *ton* of Twitter accounts that tweet hamfisted comparisons between the two, comparing photographs of a COVID-positive Trump to paintings of a comatose Justinian, or contrasting pictures of Melania in skimpy clothing from her modeling days with sexualized fan art of Theodora in her acting days. Theyre part of a whole little network of whackos that tweets nonstop about how the diversity of the modern world and the scheming of the American left is destroying their Roman dream.

When you combine all of these factorsthe obsession fascists already have with Greco-Roman culture, the religious aspects that draw in extremists like tradcaths and other fundies, the plague providing a nice parallel for coronavirus debate, Belisariuss whole life story attracting incels and sigma males, and the relative ease of comparing Trump to Justinian to make Trump look betteryou end up with a perfect storm of right-wing bullshit.

#The Decline and Fall of the Byzantine RPF Fandom

This is the part where I usually talk about some catastrophic drama-laden nightmare that tore the fandom apart or something, but to be honest, that really wasnt the case. Just as how Byzantium was weakened by civil wars and the Crusades for centuries before Mehmed the Conqueror finally put it out of its misery in 1453, this fandom was repeatedly weakened by small scandals before it was ended (kind of) by the shuttering of a popular Discord server. 

The Nazi problem, as you might expect, was a constant issue. There were so many avenues for alt-right debate to creep into innocent fandom discussions that stopping it was almost impossible. You cant talk about this time period without talking about religion and the plague and Theodora and Antoninas pasts, and every single one of those topics attracts the worst kind of debate no matter what you do. Actual far-right content could be reported or removed, and the people spewing it could be blockedbut what do you do about subtle dogwhistles, of which there are *so many?* And what do you do when people are *ostensibly* just talking about history, like Justinians religious policies, or the fact that Theodora was probably a prostitute? Its possible to discuss those things normally, but its also easy to discuss them in a way that turns violently hateful and sexist real quick. Even the best mod team in the world couldnt keep up with the sheer amount of alt-right and conspiratorial contentand thats assuming that the mods were actually a.) competent, and b.) not Nazis themselves, which wasnt always the case. Because so much of this fandom was clustered in small Discord servers and gaming communities where shitty capital-G Gamers had run the show for eons, the admins themselves were often part of the problem. 

Its also worth mentioning, of course, that one of the biggest issues with this community was that it was never really a community to begin with. It was more of a loose collective of Byzantine enthusiasts that blew up during COVID and stuck together for a while because there just isnt enough Byzantine content to sustain a million individual fandoms. To give an example, if you walked into, say, the surprisingly active Canadian Hockey RPF fandom and said what the fuck, everyone here is writing smut about real people! theyd probably be like &yeah, and? They might have disagreements over things like shipping, but they all agree that the fanfiction part is acceptable, because thats what theyre there for. But in this fandom, that wasnt the case. Whole subgroups of people viewed each other as fake, weird, and cringe, and that meant that the community was constantly at its own throat. The gamers would happily spread rule 34 of Civ 5 Theodora, but complain that writing smut about her was gross, and even within the army of smut writers, people disagreed on what was and wasnt acceptable; a lot of people were okay with lesbian sex scenes and Theodora or Antonina-centric stories, but violently opposed to anything that sexualized men (their complaints often had homophobic undertones even when they were complaining about M/F smut; some of it was very fellas, is it gay to love your wife? stuff.) And the history nerds thought everyone else was deranged. There was an endless cycle of ew, these people are writing porn about *real people!* Well, this guy *drew* the goose thing! Gross! Cant we all be normal about our uncontrollable lust for Justinian and Theodora? Wait, you guys are lusting after Justinian and Theodora? Im just here because I got bored during lockdown and thought itd be fun to read *Count Belisarius* with a group of like-minded history enthusiasts! and so on. The community was already held together by nothing but weird quarantine circumstances and a tenuously shared interest, so it was fragile from the get-go.

In any case, it was a combination of the alt-right stuff and the pre-existing fragility of the fandom that ultimately led to its downfall. Small alt-right-related incidents piled up, and because it was always a loose and drama-packed collective of people who had little in common, it couldnt withstand the endless discourse.  Every time a new vaccine or booster came out, for example, discussions would be flooded with conspiratorial garbage. This also happened every time Joe Biden or Pope Francis did literally anything. Bidens election and subsequent inauguration was a complete and total shitshow, as was Pope Francis endorsing the vaccine. Whenever incidents like these happened, non-alt-right fans trickled out piece by piece, either because the community had become too toxic or because they were afraid of being associated with the far right. Meanwhile, the Nazis stayed, and the main Discord sever (the one they were reading books on) became more and more of a hellhole. 

At some point in mid-2022, the main server shut down completely, but everyone I spoke to was long gone by then. A handful of people tried to migrate to other servers, none of which got off the ground; the momentum was just gone. Instead of staying on Discord, most people seem to have returned to wherever they came from in the first placegamers went back to gaming and AAR forums, fangirls went back to Twitter and Tumblr, and history nerds presumably went back to their actual jobs. 

**Today** 

Although the main discussion hub went down, and the lockdown that led to normal people staying home all day and occupying themselves with lame 1954 sword-and-sandal flicks is (mostly) over, the Byzantine fandom still exists in a decentralized way. You can still find plenty of shitty Byzantine Civ AARs, DeviantArt Theodora porn, and slapfights over whether Belisarius is a Gryffinclaw or a Ravendor if you dig deep enough. Many former fannish contributors have moved on to different communities, either because its hard to produce content for a dying fandom or because the Nazi problem just tainted everything and they wanted to be rid of it; a lot of them shifted to other historical fiction, or fantasy like *House of the Dragon* that mirrors real-life history without actually being RPF. Theres discourse about that, too, but since Ive already spent way too much time writing this, Im going to end here without getting into any more stupid micro-dramas. 

I will leave you with [one last Tumblr post](https://conspiring-to-regnum.tumblr.com/post/658265464056807424/sapper-in-the-wire-fieropasto-youlovedme-never), though, as a treat.:)","HobbyDrama",500,500,0,0.98,2,1,0,66

This week at Bungie, we talk about pixels and the Kilts for Kids fundraising event! 


Welcome to your first April 2022 installment of the TWAB. Yes, you read that right! Were already in the fourth month of the year. Time is flying by, and we cant help but wonder why. Maybe its the fact that we shipped an expansion in February, or the weekly hunts for Deepsight weapons that weve been embarking on. In any case, Destiny 2 keeps going strong. 


Gambit Labs went live earlier this week. Invasion Swap has been getting us some great anecdotal feedback for Mote-dunking and invasion strategies, and were excited to see the data and feedback as it comes in. We did have a small hiccup on Tuesday where the Pinnacle reward for playing three matches was not appearing, but the team quickly issued a server-side fix to get you your just rewards. Paired with double Gambit rep, its a great week to complete some Seasonal Challenges for Bright Dust and earn some nice Gambit-themed rewards.


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/156/156543/TWAB_2-17_Drifter_EN_02.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3ZRmgFy.png)


Grandmaster Nightfalls have also returned, bringing our most challenging strike content back into the fold. Weve got a slight clarification on some patch notes back from launch dealing with **Acute Burns**. In [Destiny 2 Update 4.0.0.1](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/51110), it was incorrectly noted that these burns would not be present in Grandmaster difficulty. Acute Burns are intentional and replace the unique strike modifiers (smaller burns plus extra knockback or splash damage). The new **Seasonal modifiers** (invisible enemies, etc.) are not included in Grandmasters. We have updated our patch notes page to reflect. With that said, we highly recommend using some elemental damage resist mods on your chest pieces as you buildcraft for the difficulty. 


Looking to next week, Iron Banner returns. While were planning a larger TWAB to cover upcoming changes, our one piece of advice to you this week is to spend your Iron Banner tokens, complete your Iron Banner quest, and redeem your Iron Banner bounties. We have some updates to Saladin and how hell be dishing out rewards, which naturally leads to the retirement of Iron Banner tokens and bounties. **You have two Iron Banner weeks left to spend these tokens for rewards, including next week, so make sure to plan some time in the Tower to turn them in before the end of the final Iron Banner of the Season.** Oh, and a small update from the team: we're looking to prevent the abilities bounty for our final Iron Banners before next Season. Weve heard (and felt) the feedback that it could be a bit time consuming, so were shifting to focus on objective and weapon bounties for the remainder of the Season. Happy hunting! 


So, what else is going on this week? Well be celebrating the upcoming Kilts for Kids fundraiser and having a quick story time about a wonderful community event that occurred last weekend.

##Kilts for Kids 

Year after year, the Bungie Foundation participates in numerous charity initiatives to raise funds for people in need. While we host our own streams and charity drives, once a year we dive back into our favorite kilts to drive for some wonderful goals in the name of support for children. We have some awesome incentives lined up, so read on for more! 


&gt;
&gt;**Bungie Foundation:** Kilts for Kids, our annual fundraiser that supports Seattle Ronald McDonald House (RMHC) is going 11 years strong! We bring you our usual suspects: Christine, Mark, and Forrest. After two years of stay-at-home orders, the crew was excited to take advantage of a rare sunny spring day in Seattle and don their kilts together.

##Pixel by Pixel, Place by r/Place 

Last weekend was one to remember. It started small with the placement of a pixel. Within minutes, it grew to four days of community, memes, art, Ace of Spades, and a raid boss that couldnt stop moving their legs. 


If you dont frequently visit Reddit, a wonderful weekend event kicked off where any user ***in the world*** could place a pixel on a board to start creating small (or large) pieces of art. This wonderland of expression has appeared only a few times in previous years, going by the name of r/place. While your individual efforts could yield success for a short while, this place has become a home for Reddit communities (or communities in general) to rally their members to secure a place on the board. 


Now, its not as simple as placing a pixel and calling it done. Participants could override a given pixel placement at any time (on a five-minute cooldown) to take over spots on the board, or simply bring some chaos to the conversation. This leads to a few things: intense community competitions between **millions** of different people from given message boards, communities, or even countries, all seeking to claim some place space. This also results in wonderfully positive moments when communities create alliances with each other, helping one another to defend their artwork as the weekend raged on. 


Through the weekend, two Destiny specific Reddit communities, r/DTG and r/Destiny2, led the charge in securing a spot on the board to represent the Destiny community. Through Discord chats, text messages, forum posts, and multiple other means of communication, the community effectively locked down the Destiny 2 spot through all four days. This wasnt just a simple tricorn, and Im still blown away by the coordination between hundreds (to thousands) of participants to execute on the art below:

To celebrate their efforts and the [alliances they made with other communities in gaming](https://youtu.be/QkxT0hYyhik) (and non-gaming communities), the following emblem is now available for redemption at [www.bungie.net/7/en/Codes/Redeem](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Codes/Redeem).

Cheers to all who contributed over the weekend, and thanks for yet another year of fond memories to look back on whenever we reminisce about Telesto and its resiliency.

**Sam:** Happy TWABsday, Guardians! Is it just me or has this week felt like it's taken forever and also flown by? Either way, we hope your week was super rad and we have a super fun movie we think you will really get a kick out of, an incredible 8-bit track, and can someone go check on the Child? They seem to be bullying a few Guardians again.

##Dont Let Those Meme Dreams Be Dreams

**Hippy:** Listen, OK, Im going to keep it real right now and say life is freaking hard and sometimes, its easy to take it too seriously or to miss out on the beautiful parts of it. Because of that, were mixing meme madness with some truly spectacular art. Plus, we heard you liked chaos, so as a b-b-b-bonus round, were also throwing in an excellent representation of Titan awesomeness by one artist that had the gall, nay  the audacity  to be talented as all heck. They also managed to rear up those daydreams of a fully Exoticd-out (thats a word) Guardian! Not a Titan main? That's cool, this artist also has other classes represented in a similar style, so peep out their account below!  


Without further ado, lets art!

##Time For Some Raids... or Trials?

Thanks for stopping by for another TWAB. If you ran through the steps in the TWAB [last week](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/51210) and made sure you are signed up for Bungie emails, you're likely receiving a Mechs vs Monsters poll right... now! Good luck to both #TeamMechs and #TeamMonsters for this year. Make sure to get your votes in before April 13.


**Team Monsters**

After you've gotten your vote cast, hop in to Destiny 2 for some fun. This weekends looking great for solo players seeking some Trials loot, as Freelance kicks off tomorrow at reset. If youre looking for a little Wrath to add to your arsenal, itll be a fun weekend to jump in. If you're looking for a more team oriented endgame experience, why not hop in to some Raids with friends? Maybe help a Blueberry or two to their first victory.


Looking to next TWAB, Master Vow of the Disciple is just around the corner, starting on April 19 Well be spending some time getting you prepared. Speaking of raids, tune in next Thursday for some fun news concerning an upcoming rotator of sorts in Season 17.

So my friend Natalia and I are both in our mid 20s. Natalia is currently pregnant with her second child and is around 28 weeks? Im not too sure though. Whenever her baby comes up in conversation, there have been times where I have said comments such as I wonder if IT will have you eyes, or IT will be so cute. Natalia at the time made no indication that this bothered her so I didnt give it a second thought. This has been happening since she announced her pregnancy and I am not the only one to use the word it, she has also not revealed the gender or name. 

A few weeks ago, a mutual friend asked if I am attending her baby shower, I said I am working. I then made the comment I dont get why shes having a baby shower, IT is her second baby, she already had a shower + gender reveal in 2019. I do understand needing some new items such as a car seat but the list also included MANY items she previously got at her first shower such as new baby monitors, an (IMO) expensive stroller, etc. But I kept this comment to myself. 

Natalia reached out to me the other day and I called the baby an it again. 

Natalia then got upset with me and said it was an AH move to keep calling her baby an It, as a baby isnt an object and she hopes this doesnt continue once the baby is born. I will admit, until she told us her baby names for baby 1, I also called the baby an it, until she decided on a name if it would either be a boy or a girl with the same starting initial so it became Baby R until baby was born. Since baby 1 was born, he was called by his name.

I apologized and said I didnt know my actions offended her, but she didnt accept my apology and still maintains I am an AH.

So AITA? It honestly wasnt out of malice, just unsure what to call her baby at this time.


EDIT/Clarification: 

I never have misgendered a person and know the harm in calling a person, especially a member of the LGBTQ+ community an it. I would NEVER call any person that. 

Unborn babies were the only situation in which if I didnt know the pronouns/pronoun route the parents decided to go with, or name or ANYTHING, I and others close to me used the term it.


Did friend tell Natalia baby shower comment? 

No. Weve been friends since we were babies, she at the time agree with my comment and said first time moms during pandemic/lockdown - makes sense for a do-over shower. 
I did double check, shes NEVER lied to me before, and this isnt something Id be upset over and she knows that. 

Other than Natalia, our group is still adjusting from the shit, im pregnant to yay! im pregnant, were learning, were new to this whole thing.","AmItheAsshole",500,500,0,0.94,0,0,0,211

Going back to poverty is torture.","Tldr; we were poor but happy. We made it to middle class and were comfortable and beyond happy. Due to no fault of our own tons of bad shit happened and we're back to poverty and miserable. 


I grew up in poverty. My parents are both crazy narcissists and I never knew what a ""normal"" family was. 

I'm 38 years old and still cramming myself into clothes I wore in high school. I met my husband 16 years ago. It was love at first sight. We immediately became best friends, and were (and still are) crazy in love. 

 I was working retail,  he was working behind the scenes in television. He worked on Jim Cramer's Mad Money and Imus in the morning.  Then Imus made that racist comment and the show was cancelled,  which means my husband lost his 2/3s of his imcome. He still had Mad Money, but it was hardly enough. Fast forward a year, we decided to get married.  Our wedding cost $28. We were married by the mayor. No church, no reception, no honeymoon.  

He was offered a well paying job and an apartment in TX, so we decided to move halfway across the country.  We packed up and left. Halfway there, we get a call saying they decided to hire someone else and rented the apartment.  Well fuck. (We didn't know this was probably illegal at the time) We found an apartment and struggled to find jobs. We lived in TX for 5 years, barely getting by, but managing. 

Then my older brother committed suicide, and my mom kinda went insane. Despite the fact that we couldn't afford it, we found the funds to move to live closer to my parents to help them through the tragedy. We moved in with them and stayed for almost a year working shitty jobs. We finally couldn't take it anymore (remember my parents are crazy narcissists). We found a ""cheap"" apartment about an hour away from them. 

We stayed there for a while and discussed having a family. We couldn't really afford it financially, but we were getting older and my biological clock was ticking. We decided to try, and I got pregnant pretty quickly. 

Shortly after, my husband's old tv boss offered him a super well (for us) paying job. He started working on the Megyn Kelly show. We went from making barely 35k a year to 80k a year on his salary alone. I quit my shitty job and we started house hunting. 

We found a ""fixer upper"" house. 1500 square feet, 3 bed, 2 bath, 2 living rooms. It needed (and still needs) some work, but it was perfectly liveable. It was only 16k. Your damn right we took out a personal loan and bought it.

Our daughter was born and we were happy.

Sadly (and thankfully) I never got over my ""poverty guilt"". I almost never bought anything for myself, and we stashed money away, hoping to save enough to fix the house and start retirement saving. My daughter, of course, we spoiled. 

While we didn't spend much, and we certainly weren't rich, our daily stress, that had been crushing us for years, melted away. I enjoyed being a stay at home mom and because of my husband's great hours, he got to spend plenty of time home with us.

We took a gamble, and with our savings, we paid off the house. We now owned it. It felt amazing. Shortly after that, Megyn Kelly decided to make a racist comment about blackface. Immediately,  our hearts sank and we began aggressively saving money again. Megyn Kelly's show was cancelled. FUCK! Jobless again because of stupid shit. 

He landed another job at CNBC, less hours, but ok... we will survive. I began looking for work. Then, the pandemic hit. I stopped looking for work because my daughter was due to start school soon and in person school was not an option. A babysitter also wasn't an option due to cost and possible exposure.  

Shortly after covid, my husband's boss got into a drunken fist fight with one of his employees. It was on a business trip, so while it was off the clock, it was in a hotel on CNBCs dime. CNBC fired the entire company. Due to no fault of his own, my husband lost his job for the 3rd time. He wasn't even on that trip.

PUA kept us afloat, but life was getting hard. It took a toll on all of us.

My husband attempted suicide shortly after Christmas that year.  Luckily I caught him in time, he went to the hospital,  and is still getting treatment for depression to this day. 

Oh, and this Christmas,  my parents house burned down.  So they came to live with us for a while. That was also stress and torture. (Crazy narcissists, remember? ) we tried to accommodate them and their pets to the best of our abilities, but after many a confrontation and them doing a couple of grand worth of damage to our house, they left saying we kicked them out. (We didn't, we just told them to stop breaking our house or leave.) So now my family hates me.

Just this year, my husband got another tv job. But he is only a sub and only works when people want a day off. He only gets between 1-5 days of work a month. I've started looking for work again, but pay is an absolute joke. Where we live, it would cost me about half of my pay in gas to work anywhere with my ""qualifications"". Not to mention, we only have 1 car, and a baby sitter would eat any other take home pay.

I have also started to suffer from depression and am seeking treatment.  This sucks.  I wish we had never made it to ""middle class"". When I was poor, I never knew what it was like not to have to struggle all of the time. Now that I have tasted ""comfortable living"" it's fucking agony and torture to have to live rationing food and bills again. 

I hate that my husband has lost his good paying job 3 times....3 fucking times.... due to no fault of his own. 

We're considering selling our house. We bought it for 16k and its estimated value right now is 198k. We could use the money, but then we would be out a house again for who knows how long. 

I feel like, given our circumstances,  we did everything right and still got punished for it. We will keep fighting, but fuck.... I'm tired.","rant",492,492,0,0.97,3,0,0,92

Background: My husband(29m) and I(26f) stayed with his family for a couple years because I was pregnant and we needed somewhere to stay, we weren't planning on staying for so long but after the baby was born the pandemic hit, my husband lost his job, and I ended up needing emergency surgery that drained our savings. Despite this happening we still paid them $300-$600/month for bills and the streaming services.

After my kiddo was born my inlaws started bullying me, telling me I wasn't doing anything right, I wasn't feeding him enough/the right things (I fed him every 3.5 hours when he was 0-3 months and every 4.5 hours with baby food and bottle) they threw out baby food and forced me to make it myself i worked when I was pregnant andthey didnt like that, so at 6 months pregnant i quit. After 10 months postpartum i had my surgery and got another job as soon as I healed so we could afford the bill. They would tell my husband that I was a bad wife and mom for working night shift because it meant he had to cook for the kids and put them to bed when ""thats the wifes job"". They have also acted entitled to our things in MY storage unit and would go and take things from our room and not give it back, when confronted they would say, ""everything in the house is to be shared!!""

So before we  moved out I got onto my streaming services that I pay for and have been letting them use while we lived there(Netflix, Disney+, and Spotify) and logged them out and changed the passwords on them. My Brother in law texted my husband asking for the passwords and he told him to ask me. So he texted me asking me for them and I replied with, ""why do you need them? We don't live there anymore so they don't need to be signed in to your devices."" He got mad and told me I was being super petty and acting extremely ungrateful to them. I told him that I did appreciate their help during the pandemic but I didn't appreciate their behavior towards us while we stayed there, and since we no longer reside in the house, the services no longer need to be shared with them. 

I feel bad because my husband is getting texts from both his family and cousins saying its an AH move to just cut them off the services like that without warning. So now I'm starting to think I was an AH and should just let them keep using them because they let us stay for so long even though we didn't plan on staying for as long as we did. 

TL;DR: husband and I moved out of his families house and logged them out of our streaming services because of their treatment towards us during our time living there.","AmItheAsshole",491,491,0,0.95,0,0,0,106

We were out of lab rats, so our professor used us instead.","I cant believe I finally got the guts to post this to social media.

After three years, Im finally ready to tell our story. 

I know I shouldn't. This is a huge risk, and Im putting both myself and my friends in danger of being caught by some pretty bad people who are currently hunting us down. 

My life as I knew it ended in 2020. (I would talk about how ironic it was that it had to be 2020, but I dont have time to ramble). I was volunteering as a lab assistant for a college professor I was close to. After graduating at the top of my class, I had been offered the opportunity to assist him overseas as a voluntary research assistant. I should have been working in his usual lab at the college, but due to certain ethical issues he didnt want to deal with on campus, he decided to fly his most promising students to his primary lab on a tiny Indonesian island. He took on six of us. 

The top of his class, as well as students who seemed far too interested in what he was really working on.  Normally, college professors would discourage curiosity when it came to their private lives and work, but he welcomed it, allowing certain students glimpses into the research he was working on under his façade.  I cant say I wasnt curious about the paperwork I happened to glimpse, paperwork covered in special plastic seals brandishing TOP SECRET in bold lettering which was definitely intriguing. 

Sure, I wanted to know what was so special about his research that it warranted that kind of seal, but its not like I broke into his lab unlike my colleagues. (You would think biology students would be smart, but those idiots didnt stand a chance with the amount of security our college had). 

I thought that would be a sure fire suspension, and it almost was until the professor himself had pardoned them before inviting the group alongside me to work with him on this secret project. I know I sound crazy for taking a voluntary job, but the job was on a tiny island just off of the coast of Indonesiawhich meant I was working in paradise. It was like being on a permanent vacation. We had the beach at our disposal, and the local resort was just a walk away. After sweating in the lab on weekdays, we headed to the private pool down the road. 

Professor Quincy was a well-known local, so he had managed to get us free entry. I guess you could say I was living the dream. Three years prior, I was in my freshman year of college and I had no idea what I was doing with my life. Fast forward two years, and I had the opportunity of a lifetime. I was working in literal paradise. 

It didnt last long, of course. I had to wake up from my dream at some point, right? And I did.

March 2020.

I cant remember which date it was. I just remember that it was right at the start of the pandemic, and I was supposed to be going home to see family I hadnt seen in almost six months. Professor Quincy had been insistent we live and work with him for a certain amount of time, and then he would grant us permission to return home to see our family. 

I couldnt exactly argue against it. Like I said, and I will continue to elaborate through this post, our professors work was pretty private. Cell phones were not allowed, and internet access was limited. If I needed to phone home, I had to sign seven different forms to promise I wouldnt leak any information on his work, and to declare that if I happened to do so I would be fired immediately and sent back to the US. 

If that wasnt enough, my parents would also be held accountable.

So, yeah. Obviously, I wasnt going to start spilling our professors secrets.

Its not like we were completely cut off. There was a phone in Professor Quincys office, as well as the reception at the dorms. 

We were allowed three allocated phone calls a week. After a certain world event had enfolded, however, we were allowed to call our parents pretty much any time we wanted, as long as we signed those release forms. After a full day of none-stop paranoia and too much time skimming news articles on my laptop, I was itching to talk to mom. I just didnt know how to tell her that I wouldnt be seeing her in& I had no idea. The US borders were shutting, and I was at a loss what to do. If I am to be honest with you, I was terrified. This kind of thing only happened in movies, and there I was trying to figure out a way to tell my mom I wouldnt be coming homeand I had no idea if I would ever be coming home again. The dorms were state of the art; a huge glass building with three floors. There was a gym, a swimming pool, and a girls and boys dorm on the top levels. 

There were only six of us, so it was pretty fucking amazing. Sometimes in the summer when it was baking hot, like the kind of heat the human body cant deal with, they opened the roof, and we would all lie in the reception area, drunk on cocktails from the resort. 

But do you know what wasnt state of the art? 

The air-con. 

I had grown accustomed to the stupid thing breaking every three days. Normally, I didnt really care. Id get a cold shower or stick my head in the freezer. That day, though, I had just been informed via email I wouldnt  be returning home for the foreseeable future. 

The thing was, I was so used to knowing things in advance. I knew when work was cancelled, or when I was getting sick. Though with this, I had no idea what the outcome would be. Nobody did. The planet was holding a collective  breath. I couldnt even ask for a possible date, because no one knew how this huge, insane, life-changing thing would play out.

Well, it could play out either one way or the other. And I had seen the movies. I knew the basis, or at least the fictional re-enactment. 

So, sweating through baking heat, I sat cross legged on prickly carpet, squeezing the phone in my palmy hands. I could glimpse Kaian through the window, slumped on a sun-lounger with his head tipped back. He was frowning at an odd looking bird which was perched on the upper deck. It was early evening, and the sun was starting to set. God, I loved watching the sunset. It was like the clouds had turned into cotton candy, streaks of burning red and pink enveloping crystal blue and dimming the sky, making it easier to get a good luck at the sun.

Kaians light brown hair exploded into hues of vivid red, and I was momentarily taken-aback by the sightlike the sky had set his hair on fire. Ever since meeting him in my freshman year, Id had a crush on Kaian. Being half-Thai with striking features and a Hollywood smile, my ass was already on the floor. 

However, after living with him for several months, and studying alongside him for years, I had come to realise he was more of a wolf in sheeps clothing. Not exactly a dick, but not the nicest either. Kaian was deaf and had become the sort of jock of our little research group. He had been the one to stage the break-in attempt into Professor Quincys lab. I always wondered if they really had discovered somethingand blackmailed Quincy into letting them in on the research. 

I wouldnt put it past my classmates. They were as nutty as our professor. I was half-wishing mom didnt answer. Then I would have no choice but to tell her through email, which was better. 

Still though, I wanted to hear her voice, even if it was going to send me over the edge. When my moms voice crackled through the phone, I panicked and said the first thing which came to mind. Im... Im staying here for a little longer. I said. I was told this morning I cant come home.

Mom was silent for a moment before she sighed. Yeah. I was surprised when she chuckled. I figured that, sweetie.

Youre not mad? I whispered.

She didnt reply for a moment before sighing. Why would I be mad? Its not like you can help it.

Squeezing the phone tighter, I turned away so Kaian couldnt see me sobbing like an idiot. Its not for long, I said, or rather lied. I wasnt just trying to reassure my mother, I was desperate to make myself feel better too. I think itll be late April, or maybe May. Im not sure yet.

Well, Im excited to see you.

Nodding, I swallowed a wracking sob. Im excited to see you too, mom.

Are you eating well?

Uh, yeah. The food here is great.

How is work?

She was avoiding elaborating on a conversation neither of us wanted to have, and I didnt blame her.

Its fine, I said, Weve been working in some pretty, uh& intense heat. But Im fine. I just cool off in the sea.

Thats good. I could sense my mothers smile, and it made me feel ten times worse.

How& how are things over there?

Mom hummed. Theres no toilet paper, she laughed, But were all fine. Your little brother is baking cookies. Do you want to talk to him?

No. I said, far too fast. I mean& I dont have much time, and I wanted to talk to you. I swallowed. If thats okay.

Of course, honey. Moms voice felt like warm water coming over me, relieving my stiff muscles. Oh! Your father just finished cleaning your room out the other day! You would not believe how much stuff we had to take to a yard sale. Do you remember that dollhouse you had?

Uhh

She cut me off. Well, Ive given it to Mrs Jasons daughter. Do you remember Lucy?""

Lucy. I said, my mind elsewhere. She was that kid& umm&

You held her at your auntie Christines birthday party, do you remember? Shes always asking about you. She thinks youre a marine biologist.

Oh. I said helplessly. Sensing movement, I twisted around to find Kaian heading up the stairs. Probably to his room. 

Usually, Monday nights were reserved for the beach. After lights out, we headed down to the coves which were a three minute walk from the dorms to paddle in bioluminescent plankton illuminating the stuffy night.

It was like dipping your feet in liquid stars. From the look on my colleagues face however, a sort of not-entirely-there frown, I doubted anyone was in the mood for our usual trip to the beach. Offering the boy a wave, I pulled my knees to my chest. I didnt realise Id left an awkward pause until mom cleared her throat loudly, snapping me out of  my trance.

Wren, did you hear what I just said?

Wren.

Mom only had to say my name to send my heart into my throat. Honey, are you crying?

I had to heave in a breath. No.

Youre watching the news, arent you?

Mom, Im fine.

Are you sure? Mom paused. Wren, I cant imagine what you must be feeling right now, but Im just a phone-call away.

I nodded, my eyes burning. I love you, mom.

I love you too, baby. Moms voice hitched, and she was splintering. I could tell by her sharp breaths. Ill see you soon, okay?

That was the last time I ever spoke to my mother.

The sky was dark when I pulled open the door to my shared room and face-planted into my bed. Long after putting the phone down, I sat in the reception area and cried like an idiot. Then I went outside to attempt to read a book on a sun lounger, but with the lack of sun, and the fact that the outdoor light was broken, I gave up and retreated upstairs. 

Riss, my roommate, was typing loudly on her laptop when I bothered lifting my head from my snot-drenched pillow. 

She had been taking the news surprisingly well, despite her being the one in our group who was over-emotional. Riss was a natural redhead but had dyed her hair an odd pastel pink colour which was starting to come out. I could see her natural vivid red roots springing from her half-assed ponytail. Hows your mom? 

Riss didnt look up from her laptop screen, her fingers dancing across the keyboard. I glimpsed the word doc she had been working on earlier in the lab. We were supposed to type up all the findings from the days experiments earlier, and as usual Riss was the last to submit hers. She was the lazy daydreamer out of our group, often getting chastised for zoning out during  lectures and falling asleep. Riss was smart though. Seriously smart. When she felt like it.

Hello? Riss slammed the space-bar. How was the talk with your mom?

It was fine.

Doesnt sound like it, Riss hummed. Come on, I know when youre upsetfuck. She hissed through her teeth, going to town on the backspace key. Stupid fucking autocorrect.

I didnt reply for a moment, suffocating myself in my pillow. The air-con was broken again, so I was left to suffer, stewing in the same clothes I had been wearing all day. I needed a cold shower and something from the downstairs kitchen, but I couldnt be bothered moving. Besides, Risss typing was comforting, lulling me into almost-slumber. 

After a while of just basking in the sound of her typing, my roommate sighed loudly. I sensed her jump up from her bed and move to her desk. My roommate had a routine I was  used to. After typing up her usually late reports, she jumped up, did some stretches, downed the bottle of water on her desk, and then jumped up and down with too much energy, awaiting the print out. Just as I thought, I cringed at the sound of our printer booting up. I hated the noise. It sounded like nails on a chalkboard. Its the end of the world as we know it. Riss murmured with another loud, exaggerated sigh. And were stuck in paradise.

Refusing to lift my head from my pillow despite the heat, I scoffed into the material. Stop saying that.

Stop saying what?

That its the end of the world.

I mean, it is. Certain events aside, have you seen the state of the ozone layer? Dude, were on a one way ticket to extinction.

I really didnt need Risss comforting talks right then. Her idea of reassuring was reminding me how many species were dying out.

Uh-huh. I said, cutting into her slightly manic polar bear rant. Can we talk about something else.

But its true. Riss chuckled. The world is falling apart, and here we are trying to do the impossible. She paused. In one of the most beautiful places on the planet. When I lifted my head to frown at her, my roommate was sprawled out on her bed, her ten page report awkwardly balanced on her chest. Risss eyes were somewhere else, delving into oblivion. 

I couldnt tell what she was feeling. She was smiling, but her eyes were sad. It had taken me a while, but eventually, after weeks and then months had gone by, I had gotten used to Professor Quincys research. It was hard to take in at first. Like, you have this huge secret and you cant tell anyoneif you do youre risking your own career. I imagined it as a neutron star collision going off in my head, an explosion of colours nobody else could see but us. 

Locked away on this tiny island, we were the only ones who knew Quincys goal. There was one rule in the lab. 

No emotions. We werent allowed to have emotions once stepping through the door. We had to stop being human for the sake of achieving successes and moving onto a different age. A better age. Thats what Quincy said, anyway. I wondered if Riss was thinking about  the work we did earlier. She had broken down three times since starting, though she was getting better. Riss didnt speak much after an awkward conversation we had about the end of the world, which bled into a conversation about The Walking Dead. 

It fizzled out after I reminded her I was yet to finish it after dumping it halfway through season four. Theres not much to do in the dorm. I had my laptop and several dozen movies downloaded onto it, but I wasnt in the mood to delve into fiction.  I was falling asleep when our door flew open, and Riss almost catapulted her laptop across the room. My gaze flicked to the doorway, where Kaian stood, a scowl carved into his lips. It wasnt unusual that my colleague was scowling or standing in our doorway. He was always the first one up on a morning, quick to wake everyone else up despite the sun not being up yet.

Kaian? Riss signed, her eyes glued to our damp-looking colleague. What the hell?

Looking at him, I could tell that Kaian wasnt there willingly. His hair was a soaking mess plastered to his forehead, a plaid shirt clumsily buttoned over ratty shorts. He looked like hed just gotten out of the shower. No, he didnt just look like it. 

I was sure Kaian had just gotten out of the shower. When he held up one hand, and started to furiously sign, the jingling noise brought my attention to the cuff attached to his left wrist. Jem. He signed his roommates name, and I resisted the urge to collapse back into bed. Nothing was good when Jem was involved. I loved my colleague, but the amount of stupid shit he had done since starting work on the island, he could make his own sitcom.

Riss groaned, shutting her laptop. She quickly signed, What has he done now?

Kaians expression twisted with fury. What HASNT he done? He held up his wrist, signing manically. He cuffed me to my bed!

Kinky. I shot him a smile, and seeing his expression, I quickly regretted my words when his gaze flashed to a stuffed animal on the floor.

I had no doubt he wouldnt aim for my face.

What? Why did he cuff you your bed? Riss was already pulling on her jacket. I jumped up too, slipping into my sandals.

Rabbits. Was all Kaian had to sign with wide eyes, before we were following him back down the dorm hallway, and down the stairs. I was practically falling over myself to keep up. Kaian ran in front, Riss stumbling beside him. If Jem was in the lab after hours, it wasnt good. Ever since we made the switch from rats to rabbits, Jem had been very vocal that he was against it. But like Quincy said, we had to give up our humanity in that room. Our morals. Anything we thought, our opinions and emotions. We had to suppress it all. 

Because once we started to give into them, our professor had proclaimedthat was when cracks would start to form. According to him, the first step in turning your back on science was giving into your humanity. I wasnt quite there yet. Its not like I didnt have intrusive thoughts about saving the poor things, but Quincy had planted a very specific thought in our heads. If we rebelled, if we leaked information and went against himour families were at risk of getting involved despite having nothing to do with it. 

Jem had already submitted multiple complaints, and I didnt blame him. But its not like we could all band together to stop Quincys experiments. Like I said, we were walking on eggshells around him and he was already a fairly paranoid man. And morals and humanity aside, his work was pretty fucking incredible. Disgusting and inhumane? Yes, of course. But truly incredible. The lab was a five minute walk from the dorms. Riss was out of breath as we ran across the shore, and I glimpsed a full moon light up the darkening sky, illuminating oblivion in milky white light. What I dont understand, she panted, Is why cuff you to your bed?

She turned to Kaian, who signed, He knew I was going to tell someone. When I got out of the shower, he grabbed me and cuffed me to the frame. The boy scowled. Im going to kill him. By the time the three of us were throwing ourselves through the doors of the lab, pressing our identity badges over the mechanical lock, I was sweating. Bad. I think all three of us wanted to collectively murder our colleague. The lab was usually out of bounds after work hours, but sometimes Professor Quincy made exceptions if we needed to finish reports or collect data.

Riss was stabbing in the eight digit code to get into Quincys office, and I was struggling to catch my breath, keeled over with my hands on my knees. The building was usually lit up, even at night. I had spent countless after work hours typing up research reports and listening to music, comforted by the warm glow from the lights overhead. But that wasnt the case on that particular night. A coil of dread began to unravel in my gut as we bound down the main hallway which was swamped in darkness. Riss made a joke about failed experiments lurking around us, and I elbowed her sharply in the gut. 

Thankfully, Quincys main lab was lit up. When the door swung open with a loud beep, the three of us bound straight into a startled looking Jemwhose expression almost matched the ones of the dozen baby rabbits cradled to his chest. If Kaian resembled a Hollywood star, then this guy reminded me more of a punk kidmaybe a theatre kid too. Jem was the wildcard in our group. He wasnt the smartest, and he struggled sometimes. But Quincy had admired the boys curiosity in his research. Jems hair was always a mess of dishevelled curls, and his outfit choices were& odd. For example, Jem had opted for wearing pajamas to his rabbit heist.It was almost like he had an epiphany in his sleep and hurricane thoughts had led him right to the lab.  

For a moment, I was unsure whether to laugh or start yelling at him. Jem peeked at us under his hood, his eyes almost cartoonishly wide. Like he was a kid being caught stealing cookies from the cookie jar. The subjects he was holding seemed to cling onto him, and I had a momentjust a momentwhere I cracked slightly. Especially when the largest ones tiny eyes found mine. 

It was frightened, its claws digging into his sleeve. I can explain. Jem finally spluttered, pressing the rabbits closer to his chest. This is animal abuse. He said in a hiss. Youre not really going to stand there and watch that bastard hurt these little guys, are you? I was sure Jem was convinced he could get away with it by showing us the power of cuteness.

I cant say it wasnt working. God, the one in the middle with large floppy ears and a brown smudge on its fur was really looking at me.

Like it was staring into my soul.

Next to me, Kaians expression was easing a little. He leaned against the door with his arms folded.

Theyre kind of cute. He signed, smiling for the first time since earlier that morning when Riss spilled orange juice all over herself.

See? Jems smile was soft, and he gestured to them. Look at them! Theyre adorable. Im not going to let him hurt them.

Riss, however, seemed unfazed. She took a step towards him, her eyes darkening. Are you fucking insane? she gritted out. So, what, you want to let Quincys test subjects go?

Jems lip curled. Hes got rats. Im sure hell be fine. He backed away, clutching the rabbits tighter to his chest. Youve seen what hes done to them, he whisperedand his gaze flicked to me, and then Kaian. What WE have done to them. Its not fair. Theyre living creatures, and were& were hurting them. 

Fuck. 

This was what I was afraid of. Ever since the six of us started on the island, and Quincys lecture on suppressing our humanity for the sake of science, I knew one of us was going to break when we saw what exactly he was doing to his subjects.

Im not going to go into detail, because again, I am already putting myself at risk by writing this. But I will say that Quincys experiments werent.. normal. Ive already told you they were inhumane and immoral. 

But it didnt end there. You see, our professor was surepositive that he could ignite a certain part of the human brain with simple stimulation, a hell of a lot of drugs, and psychological tactics. He believed he could find that missing part that is missing in all of us which stops us from being the apex predator.

Abilities way beyond our comprehension.

Professor Quincy had been working his whole life to create a serum which would hack into the mind, and switch on that part of us we cannot find on our own. Rats didnt give him the right results, so we moved onto rabbits. 

So far, I had witnessed a rabbit which could teleport from one cage to the other, after several surgeries, serum injections directly into its brain. 

Impossible. 

I thought it was impossible, and yet somehow I was watching it with my own eyes. A living thing disappearing in one place and reappearing in its cage. Through research, we had come to realise the cage was the rabbits safe place. Whatever ability it had (and there were many), it would always return to its cage, no matter where we placed them. The serum wasnt perfect, however. I had witnessed a rabbit interfere with the electronics in the lab, playing with the lights, before exploding into large fleshy chunks painting the metal prongs of its cage a startling gory red. 

The rabbits in Jems arms were our only proof that the serum worked. They were our last surviving four. Subjects 2, 6, 10, and 15. I have to admit, subject 15 freaked me out. Fifteens ability was not yet known, but Kaian was sure that it was developing heightened intelligence. I didnt know much about Fifteen, but from what I did know, there was no fucking way we could let Jem let the little guy run free. 

Knowing what they were capable of, and what we could possibly lose if my colleague got his own way, snapped me out of my, Aww theyre so cute, trance. I stepped forward, cringing when I glimpsed remnants of the metal headset which had been drilled into Sixs skull.

Give them here. I said, and when Jem started to shake his head, I snapped. Do you want to get fired?

He wasnt letting up. Theyre living things, Wren!

I nodded, trying to keep my cool. They are. I said. But theyre also valuable subjectsone of which can fucking teleport. I wouldnt exactly say theyre normal rabbits. I held my breath. Look. I gave up acting like I knew what the fuck I was talking about. I dont like it either, okay? Its disgusting and immoral, and findings and psychokinetic abilities aside, I would be totally on your side if we didnt have results.

But we do have results. Kaian signed. He seemed to have snapped out of it too. Give them back, Jem. Theyre research subjects.

Theyre rabbits! Have you guys lost your minds?

Yes. Kaian signed. Its part of the job description, asshole.

You have a dog! Jem shot back in a manic hiss. His expression was feral. I had never seen that kind of desperation, almost unbridled lucidity let loose. Its no different to your dog, right? Would you seriously put him through this? Would you stick a needle inside his skull?

Kaian didnt reply, his jaw clenching.

No. You wouldnt. So, why these guys, huh? Why are you willing to be cruel for the sake of science for these guys, but you wouldnt fucking dream of doing this to your pets? Jem took another shaky step back, so I figured hitting him with the hard truth would snap him out of it.

Its not the same, Kaian seemed to be struggling, his hands trembling as he signed. Its& its different

Whats different? Jem demanded. Theres no difference! If it were a rat I would feel the same way! Were hurting living animals.

Your dad, I said quickly, Do you want to drag him into this?

Again. Kaian started to sign, Riss elbowing him to shut up. It was no secret Jem and his father had been under fire back home after discovering a document he shouldnt have. All he did was read it. According to the boy himself, he had the Men In Black trying to crash through his door at 4am.  Jem  was lucky Professor Quincy decided to use his curiosity as a tool instead of sending his family to jail.

Jem blinked, like he was waking from a trance. No. He said, quickly, his resolve crumbling. My colleague allowed Kaian and Riss to take the subjects and put them back in their cages. I expected him to fight back, but the guy seemed weirdly fine with us taking the rabbits back, stumbling away from them like they were contagious. 

With all subjects accounted for, we headed back to the dorms and ate dinnerand I remember running my hands through Jems hair, a little bit drunk on cocktails, and promising him that once Professor Quincy was finished with his research, he would let the rabbits go. I wasnt completely sure of this myself, and it was just a friendly lie to make him feel better, considering hed been acting weird all night. I had been lazily sipping water to sober myself up when the thought hit me. 

It didnt really make an impact, more of a passing thought. Did subject Fifteen have any influence over Jems mind? 

Fifteen had already proved it could type a single sentence on a keyboard and tap on a tablet screen to identify certain fruits. 

Was it possible that it had developed the ability to influence the  brain? I wasnt sure I wanted an answer to that. Anyway, we all headed to bed, and I made Jem promise he wouldnt do something like that again. I still remember the way hed looked at me, slightly confused, mouth open, like he had no idea what I was talking about. I figured he was just tipsy, and after frowning at me for way longer than necessary, Jem saluted me with a Yeah, course I promise.

Yeah, that promise lasted maybe six fucking hours.

I was spooning dry cereal in my mouth the next morning, trying to ignore the news bulletin on the TV, when we got the first call. Jem had broken into the lab two hours ago, and let the subjects run free. By the time Id thrown myself into the lab, barely dressed, the others were already getting screamed atand I mean SCREAMED at by Quincy. I glimpsed my colleagues through the glass window as I threw myself into a run towards the lab. It looked like they had been dragged out of bed. 

Riss was in her robe, Kaian and Jem half dressed. The three were sitting in the communal area looking like they wanted to sink into the earth, while Quincys voice reverberated back down the hallway. 

When I stepped through automatic doors, our professor turned to me, his expression thunderous. Wren! He passive aggressively gestured to the others. Why dont you take a seat, hm? His British accent was easy to tolerate usually, but that morning he sounded like a fucking Bond villain. I nodded and practically dived next to Riss, who looked like she was ten seconds from wrapping her hands around Jems neck. Kaian was glaring at his lap, ignoring the professors ASL, and Jem lookedwell, he looked kind of confused.

Youre late. Quincy turned his piercing gaze to me.

Im five minutes early, Professor Quincy. I said, glancing at the clock to make sure I was right.

The man didnt respond, turning back to Jem. As I was saying, I was just letting your colleague know that he has thrown quite a wrench in our plans. But no matter, we can fix this. He cleared his throat. Mr Saeueng. Professor Quincy nodded to Kaian. There are several research subjects in storage that I have been saving for these kinds of emergencies,  He said. Please retrieve them so we can continue working on this project. And hurry up.""

Kaian paled. For a moment I thought he was going to barf. Professor Quincy, he started to sign, before pausing, You ordered me to dispose of them two weeks ago, He shot me a look, and I remembered the two of us loading a cage full of rats into a truck. We dont have them.

The professors expression contorted, and he smiled. He& smiled. Like he thought it was funny. Right. He said in a breath. Youre telling me, He lifted his arm like he was going to strike each of us. And I sensed the four of us collectively wince. Youre all telling meall four of you, that our current research subjects are nowhere to be seen, our backup subjects have been disposed of, and I am supposed to be doing a presentation next week?""

His voice cracked. Next week! He repeated, beginning to pace, and I was starting to regret choosing my curiosity over my wellbeing. Sure,  psychokinetic abilities are cool, right? Cracking open the human brain and discovering something magical, something out of this world, was a dream come true. We were witnessing history being made. What could fundamentally change the world. 

But I was sitting inside a lab with a man who was clearly unhinged, thousands of miles from home, and no guarantee I would ever return home. A shiver slid down my spine when our professor stopped pacing up and down, and something seemed to light up in his eyes.

I saw it. Something in his brain& snapped. It was like seeing a real-life light bulb moment. Were okay. He said, after a moment of silence. Quincy seemed to gather himself. Youre dismissed. I will.. I will get my hands on new research subjects, do not worry about that. His smile was far too big, and I nodded, relieved, and jumped to my feet, eager to make a quick getaway.

Jem stood up, grabbing his bag. Will we have time? He asked. I mean& the presentation is next week, and we need to start over.

Thats right, Riss was frowning. Professor, where exactly are you going to get new subjects? Didnt the college stop funding the project?

Hm? Oh, I have subjects, he chuckled. I have always had subjects, dont worry. They have always been my last resort.

I nodded. So, do you have spare rats?

Makes sense. Kaian signed. I bet he has a secret batch somewhere.

Precisely, Kaian. Professor Quincy nodded, a wide smile splitting his lips apart.

So, rats? I pressed. He still was yet to answer my question and I was growing anxious of what these subjects were.

It must have been rabbits, surely. Rabbits were our best shot at getting results. Rats worked well, I guessed. But not as good as rabbits.

He caught my eye, and something cold slipped down my spine when the mans grin didnt waver. You could say theyre rats. He seemed to be drinking me in, his gaze flicking up and down, from my head to my toes. And dont worry. They will be ready for the presentation. I will make sure.""

Well, thats great. Jems expression brightened. So, we didnt have to use rabbits after all, huh? Who would have thought.

To my surprise, the professor was in unusually high spirits. After a lecture repeating his insistence that we had to supress our humanity for the sake of science (which was mostly aimed at Jem) He flocked to his desk, sorting through paperwork, and leaving the room several times to take part in phone calls. He must have really been pushing to get new living materials. I noticed his hands were quivering. Was it fear? 

Excitement? 

Without a word, Quincy left the lab with an armful of paperwork. When Riss asked what we were supposed to do, he told us to stay exactly where we were, while he retrieved new research materials. Great. 

With the professor gone, it didnt take long before Riss was trying to strangle Jem, acting like it was playful, but the look in her eyes definitely had a more nefarious intent. 

Kaian, being the smartass of our group, was already sorting through our days work, as if we hadnt just lost our subjects. The lab was pretty much our playground (The professors words, not mine) but there was a specific room which was out of bounds. Quincy called it the FAIL room, where all of his failed experiments were. Living or dead, or preserved in some weird solution, the exact reason I was convinced he was unhinged, was in that room. I didnt realise it was unlocked, until a crashing sound sent me jumping up from my chair, my heart catapulting into my throat.

Jem and Riss looked up from their work, and I noticed Kaians seat was empty.

That sounded ominous. Jem shot me a look. Did he&

He didnt. I muttered, my gaze flicking to the other side of the room, where, to my surprise, the room which had always been out of bounds, was in fact open. Before I could hesitate or think of the consequences, I hurried to the door, coming to a grinding halt on the threshold. 

I was aware of my colleagues shadow several feet away from me. I was aware of the petrified look of fright carved into his face, and his eyes, wide, like he was staring into oblivion. Like the darkness had already taken him. 

Instead of finding Kaian, I was seeing what I can only describe as several lumps piled on top of each other. When I got closer, forcing my feet into submission, those lumps bled into very human-like figures wrapped in see-through plastic. For a disorienting second, while my head spun around and around, a slithery paste crawling up my throat, I saw them as nothing but lumps of naked flesh bulging through plastic. 

But then I was recognising faces, faces I knew--faces which had been mutilated, stained a startling scarlet like they had been dipped in the reddest paint available. I knew the first lump. Sara. She went home two weeks earlier due to illness. The following fleshy lump with its face ripped off, which I could no longer call human, was Thomas. He too went home for a family emergency and never came back. 

Quincy said they had both requested to leave. He said they would miss us, but it was too much. Seeing what we were doing was too much for them. They couldnt suppress their emotions. Sara and Thomas had never left. They never went homethey were right in front of me, reduced to chunks of flesh and bodily organs.

There was a white strip of paper attached to both of them, a single word written in bold lettering.

FAIL.

That word sent my stomach heaving, my feet stumbling back, and my body erupting into fight or flight.

Kaian twisted around, his face illuminated in dim light flickering from a bulb above.

Out. He signed, and it was the desperation in his eyes, the heaving breaths struggling from his lips, which got me moving. I was pressing my hand over my mouth, muffling a sharp scream ripping from my throat, when Kaian grabbed my arm and dragged me back. I was barely conscious of getting out of that room before the alarms started, sending me to my knees.

What the hell is that? Riss was next to me, her voice shrill.

Jem had one hand planted over his ear, his arm wrapped around a hysterical Kaian. Wren, what is it? Whats in there?

I couldnt reply. Instead of trying to speak or explain, I grabbed Riss and dragged her to the door. Kaian and Jem were already on the hallway, and I was barely slipping back through the automatic doors, before they slammed shut, and a familiar voice crackled over the speakers. Stay where you are. Professor Quincy said. We will be returning to work very soon. By the grace of god, I have found subjects.

Us.

My blood ran ice-cold in my veins.

He was talking about us.

""What the fuck?!"" Jem yelled. ""What are you talking about?"" 

I didnt think. I just ran. And sprinting down that hallway, which was familiar, which had always felt like a second home to me, I had no idea it would become my prison.

It would become the very hallway I would wish to die on.

The hallway I would be dragged down, day after day, while my mind was picked apart. 

Ahead of us, the doors were shutting, red lights bathing our faces. I remember how scared they were. Jem, who reached the exit doors, slamming his fists into the glass. Riss, trying to override the mechanical lock. Kaian, who had given up, dropped onto his knees, and pulled them to his chest. When gas filled the air, I was still trying to get through the door. Riss had forced Kaian to his feet, and Jem was trying to find any weapon in his vicinity. 

But there were no weapons. There was just the four of us against a gas which was quickly disorienting us. When black spots started to dance across my vision, and Jems eyes rolled to the back of his head, his body dropping to the floor, I was thinking about Subject Fifteen. I was thinking about its beady eyes when I bit my lip and drilled into its tiny skull under my professors gaze. Riss dropped next.

Then Kaian.

I was quickly losing consciousness, my clammy head pressed against glass, clawing at the lock, when the thought hit me.

We deserved it.

For what we had done to those rabbits, playing god, and trying to turn them into something they werentwe deserved it.

Whatever my professor was planning to do to us, I had an inkling  it would be far worse than what the rabbits had endured. We were going to suffer, I thought dizzily. 

For science.

And I can tell you, three years later, as I currently share a hotel room with three murderers, my past self was fucking right.","nosleep",490,490,0,0.97,0,0,0,21

I'm celebrating the one year anniversary of my uterus eviction and reflecting on some of the most absurd things people have said to me to make me want to have babies. I was vocally against having kids ever since I *was* a kid, and my conservative, religious family and church friends used to bingo me constantly as a teenager. Some even said they hoped I'd get pregnant by accident as a teenager because then I'd change my mind and keep it. Teenage pregnancy is the status quo among my family and every generation previously so I'm pretty thrilled to say I will die having had ZERO pregnancies in my life.

But one comment really stands out, really took the cake for me. Because I am not a parent, I put a lot of time and energy into animals. When the pandemic started I got into the habit of picking up cats from bad situations, getting them healthy and socialized, and then rehoming them with forever families. It was just something to do that made me feel good. One of the cats I took in turned out to be pregnant with a litter of TEN kittens. In order to give these kitties the best shot at life, I decided to fundraise for their expenses so I could get them all vaxxed, fixed, and raised on the best kitten food out there. In exchange for donations I shared the mama cat's birth on my social media and pictures/videos of the kittens every day. Some of the kittens even got sponsors, and social media helped me find perfect homes for them. 

The birth was horrific. Like, it went smoothly and everything and the kittens were sweet but oh my god was it gross and it took so long and was so scary. After all the kittens arrived I got a message from a family member asking if the miracle of birth had made me want to get pregnant and have a baby with my husband. This lady lives and breathes babies so I wasn't entirely surprised, but I felt like it was such a gross thing to ask. What on earth about a cat having kittens would make me want to have babies?! I told her no, but that it did make me want to keep fostering kittens! I kick ASS at raising kittens! Three years later and I still get to kitty-sit and visit my ""babies"" from that litter, and mama is fixed and living her best life with a lovely family. 

So yeah, in conclusion breeders are creepy and insane, watching animals endure birth does not make me want to experience it myself and it is more like a curse than a miracle.","childfree",489,489,0,0.98,0,0,0,46

My brother is almost there now. And there is not enough popcorn on the planet for this show, though I do have a front row seat.","To make a very long story short, my mother is a walking cluster B personality disorder with absolutely no ability to understand she is the problem, and thus it will not get better.  I quit speaking to her years ago, over a little thing called being queer and having a non-traditional family.  

My little brother and I agreed that she's a fucking problem, but he wasn't ready to walk away yet.  I can understand that, it was really damn hard for me to do it, too, and I should've done it years before I actually did.  I'm clearly the scape goat, he's clearly the golden child, so his experience has also been different.  There's also a large age gap between us where I'm quite a bit older.  I figured he'll get there in his own time.  He learned critical thinking skills from me, and when he decides to be argumentative, he's both a rat bastard and highly skilled.  Once he gets to that point, there's no holding him back.  Someday, that day will come.

And all these years later, here we are.  

Pull up a seat, ladies and gentlepersons, because I am so fucking proud of this (admittedly 30 something year old now) kid!  Take in the perils of parentifying your scape goal and letting them become your golden child's ""adultier non-adult,"" because the absolute second best part about this after my brother is that they set this up themselves, even if they didn't realize it at the time.

Several weeks ago, my father was admitted to the hospital.  My mother called my brother to tell him.  Brother calls me to tell me, though I have not asked for any of that kind of thing.  He always comes to me when bad shit is going down with them, and he says it's ""because (I) should know,"" when really it's because I was his sane semi-adult when we were growing up and he needs his parent-lite person.  That's cool, I will still be his sane semi-adult, any time he needs me to.  

The next day, my brother calls me at 5 am because our mother has pissed him off so badly he forgets that time zones are a thing.  Long story short, he called to check on dad the following morning, and mom gave him an update, and then asked him if he was telling me any of this.  He said yes, and she went off on me for that (because everything is my fault, even when I haven't spoken to them in years!), up to and including ""So who do think the real problem here is, anyways?""  

He hung up on her.  This is the first time in a while she's brought me up, but he has made it abundantly clear, every single time she does, that he absolutely is not interested in cutting contact with me because she asked him to.  He and I have no problems.    Hanging up is his standard at that point.

But from then onwards, he was not able to get an update on our father that was more than three words.  This is shit my mother pulled repeatedly on her sister when our grandmother was dying, and ultimately her sister went no contact over it.  She'd call and act like death was imminent, and then switch to 3-5 word texts, if she bothered to reply at all.  

At some point, he texts me to say that our father has requested that I not get any of his medical information.  And some ranting about how stupid my brother thinks this is.  He asks me what to do.  I said ""How about you tell me whatever you want, even if it's just because you need to talk about it, and I don't judge you about it?""  Because for normal people, it is that easy.  All good.  Unless me or my two bio kids need to know for our family medical history, I don't care.  My two adopted kids, thankfully, don't factor in.  I'm a little jealous, honestly.

So my brother calls me this past weekend.  Primarily, it's because his amazing wife is due to give birth to their third beautiful child this week, and he's nervous.  But he starts talking about plans this week, and he ends up saying, ""So, um, I sat mom and dad down last week.""  

Oh boy.  I bet my therapist some shit would go down the week before the baby was due, and I just won that bet.  So I asked him what happened.

""Well, Dad has an issue that caused the hospitalization.  He's been on meds to deal with it, and he has an appointment next week where they're going to decide if the meds are working, or if he needs an outpatient procedure to deal with it.  This is not a walk in the park, but neither is it life threatening.""

""Okay, well at least it's not super serious then.""

""So Mom wanted me to drive up there, and I told her that I wasn't going to be there because (Bestest SIL)'s c-section is scheduled for next week and I'm not fucking leaving my wife and newborn until I'm damn good and ready, and I'm certainly not doing it in a pandemic with a post-op wife and an unvaccinated newborn.""

""WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!  Good for you!""  Yep, my therapist absolutely lost that bet.  

""So mom starts guilting me that they won't let anybody in to sit with her who isn't family, so the priest can't even sit with her, and she was making it out like I was the only one who could possibly go.  So I asked her whose fault it was that she only has one person in their family she feels like she could call.""

""Dude!  Go you!""

""And then she started on about that whole dad doesn't want me to talk to you about his medical stuff, and talking about how awful it was when (Aunt) wouldn't give her details about (Grandmother), but that's what she did to Aunt all the time.  So I asked her why she thought it was cool to do that to me about dad when she asked if I had talked to you.""

""That's a damn good point.""  

""So anyways, I told her that I was willing to give her one last chance to not be a bitch, and I would keep dad's medical info to myself, but I wanted something in return.""

Uh-oh.  ""Okay?""

""I told them that I never wanted to hear your name out of their mouths, ever again.""  

""......seriously?""

""Seriously.""

What a magnificent fucking bastard.  I would never have thought of that.  But it's perfection.  

""That is brilliant, sir.  You know they can't do it, right?""

""Yeah.  But I can't do this the rest of my life, either.  So now there's a line in the sand.""  

There's a lot of ways in this world to say 'I love you,' but I think my little brother might have just given me a new favorite. 

I talk to my therapist next week.  We'll have to set a betting pool on how long before they blow it.  And I need to stock up on the popcorn.  Because he is not taking their shit anymore, and this is going to be glorious.  Hard, yes.  But also?  Glorious!","JUSTNOMIL",486,486,0,0.97,1,0,0,25

It has officially been one year since I have seen my Q sister and her 5 children. When the panthemic hit That is when my sister started falling into  Q. By summer 2021 she was annoyed with us about still wanting to be safe about covid especially since her and her family refused to get vaccinated. My father is immune compromised From getting polio when he was a child, So you'd think that would be enough for her to understand. But no.

 In September of 2021 I found out I was pregnant with my 1st child. My husband and I  Waited 12 weeks to tell anyone. During those 12 weeks I had conversations with my doctors and midwives about how to deal with my unvaccinated extended family.  And let me be clear they are not just unvaccinated from from covid her 3 little ones who were all under the age of 7 Are not fully vaccinated for polio or measles mumps rubella.  Obviously my doctor's advice was to keep my distance.  Around December was when my sister figured out I didn't want to be around them and got very offended ans hurt, yet She made no effort to Even ask what would make me feel comfortable. I dealt with a few complications during this Pregnancy and keeping myself and my baby safe maybe safe was the most important thing. Fast forward to May,  After almost 40 hours of labor I gave birth to a beautiful baby boy via C-section.  

Just like when I was pregnant there has been no effort to try to see us. Every single one of my friends, Who are all vaccinated, Are willing to take a test before they come over to see him. But my sister is so obsessed  and stuck in this Q world, she will not get to meet her nephew.  This is an especially hard blow as  One of her daughters is my God daughte and I practically raised late raised 2 of her kids for her. On top of all of this on Monday her and her family are packing up and moving About 6 hours away. I know in her head this is all my fault. I am the paranoid one who was brainwashed into thinking that I was in danger simply because her children didn't have vaccines. Mind you during the pandemic I completed a master's degree in psychology and wrote my thesis on the psychological impact of covid.  This meant that I had to learn everything about the virus that I could. From the science of it to how it's portrayed in the news.  If being educated makes me brainwashed then I don't know what to say. 

 At the end of the day this is all just very sad. Q stole my sister and her family from me as well as from a bunch of other people.  And now my beautiful son Is here and I can't make excuses for her anymore. She's sick, she needs help, And there's not a damn thing I can do about It. So I guess I wrote this out as a way of letting go. I'm going to miss her and the kids but I've been missing them for a really a long time. Maybe the change In location will help her.

Today I got another guilt-tripping message from my brothers girlfriend (the mother of my nephew) trying to make me feel guilty for not yet meeting my nephew when her and my brother and her other kids all refuse to follow any COVID prevention protocols whatsoever.

I am beyond frustrated and disgusted.

I know that, obviously, they have been listening to some ridiculous misinformation and have been swept into harmful influences. However, they decided to actively try for their first baby together during the middle of COVID. I had concerns the entire pregnancy that my other family members shared (I.e.: Why would they choose to try to have a baby right now and how/when are we going to be able to safely see the baby?; How can we go over and help like we would in normal times if they dont follow any safety guidelines?, etcetera). Well, the baby just had his first birthday. They are still following zero protective protocols. The entire rest of my family has basically acquiesced out of peer pressure and discomfort, so they finally allowed them to come to a family event after taking a single test right before. I did not go.

This was an event for my 96-year-old grandma, who was just diagnosed with a heart issue. They basically dont seem to care that they put her or everyone else at risk, because they must just not think COVID is a problem. They all had it a few weeks ago and claimed it was easy to get through.  Unfortunately, they dont realize that others are often not as lucky, or that they could have a terrible time the next round.

Let me also include that the rest of us have had to skip the past several holidays together (Christmas, Thanksgiving, etcetera) despite all the rest of us being vaxxed and masking and distancing and testing regularly, because my uncle felt bad leaving them out, so none of us got to see each other or form our own pandemic pod. My brother and his girlfriend seem to have no qualms about making everybody else in the family uncomfortable or inconveniencing/putting everyone at risk for their own desires.

&amp;#x200B;

I have many chronic health issues and symptoms and have fought hard the past 3 years to improve. I fought my way from being almost always bedridden for about 5 years, which took up half my twenties, to finally, this year, being able to sometimes cook a meal, clean a bit, take more frequent showers and take 5 minute walks with a break.

I still, daily, have lung struggles, heart palpitations, and chest pains, and have developed PSVT. My doctors think I may have had something similar to COVID years ago, or an environmental exposure. Either way, they have never checked in or asked me how Im doing. And they have got to be insane if they think Im going to ignore COVID safety and risk being bedridden again or worse, because they simply want to have fun without even trying to prevent spread. No. No.

No.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, I got another text today, as I mentioned earlier, that said (similar to the other times), Hed really love to see you sooner than later after she sent me videos of my nephew. I asked if they were vaccinated, or planning on it anytime soon. She said, very short and cold, No and not planning on it soon. Okay, well, they also wont wear masks. So wtf?! You want me to meet my nephew so badly, but you wont do anything to help make it safe or comfortable. So basically, in their minds, I am the selfish a-hole who wont see my nephew, when they decided to plan a pregnancy in the middle of a pandemic and then follow zero preventative measures. I dont understand how they think. Im gonna rip my hair out, my friends. \*Sigh\*.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel this is another example of narcissistic thinking and behavior from this bunch, and I am so sick of and exhausted by it. I am wracking my brain trying to make sense of how there are people in the world who believe that everybody should bow down and put themselves at risk of death or organ damage for them, because they just dont want to take the most minor or preventative measures. How the hell can you ask/expect that of someone? I really want to have a relationship with my nephew at some point, but I cannot risk my health and life if they dont show any courtesy or compassion for anyone else. They are literally fine putting everybody else at risk as long as they get their way or enjoyment. I cant fathom this mentality.

I just needed to vent because I am so utterly drained and disturbed.

Thank you for listening and for any cameraderie/encouragement/commiserating you might be willing to offer. Im so angry and hurt that they have so little care, regard, or understanding for anyone else and continue to insinuate that Im being selfish or that pushing these kinds of boundaries is normal/acceptable. This is textbook narcissism. Im glad my grandma didnt catch it from them. Sigh.

&amp;#x200B;

oh, and btw, they almost gave it to my Mom recently; They saw her the night before they tested positive and saw her with no masks. Luckily, she was vaxxed and didnt catch itm but they were also around my Dad, who has fallen prey to their nonsense. So at this point, they could have sickened everyone close to me, and Im infuriated. This is what happens when you listen to Joe Rogan, who cant interpret studies properly, and have no science knowledge or desire to gain an6 at all. Help me.

They were my everything. Especially through the pandemic. I loved those boys so much, and when Mom came out from her home office for her meal break, she and I would talk a lot and got quite close too. They knew a lot about my life, I was still with them when my long term relationship was lost to the pandemic, and they were just the only consistent ray of sunshine in such a terrible, weird time of life for everyone.

Mom and I spoke a few times after they let me go (they had just worked out their schedules to not need me) but after a brief exchange in April 21, she didnt reply the last time I reached out in June 21. So, I left it alone, told myself to get over it, but I never stopped thinking of them, loving them and missing them. I mean, several of my friends who dont care about kids at all have sat through stories about these kids.

Then she texted me today, out of the blue. Sent a pic of the boys and told me that they were talking about me, and they do so often. She told me they miss me, and that I had such a profound impact on them all. She also told me DB &amp; her didnt make it through the pandemic, so I think thats probably why I was let go &amp; why we hadnt spoken sooner. Life was happening for us all.

I cant fully express how happy I was to hear from her and learn that all the feelings were mutual this whole time. So now, were planning for me to come to their new house for dinner (and to play, of course!) soon, and Im so excited. Life has been pretty rough for me lately, again, and this month is always hard on me as its when I shouldve had a baby I lost 6 years ago, so seeing them all soon is just going to be so good for my soul. I just had to share this with the people who get it. Its like a piece of my heart was revived.","Nanny",473,473,0,0.99,2,0,0,15

This shit is unreal! 

We got pregnant before we knew a pandemic was coming! We birthed babies in unsafe conditions, some of us by ourselves with the extra added stress of navigating a system NO OTHER PERSON had navigated before. All that prep we did just to have it blow up, crazy!

We raised babies ALONE, no contact with a tribe, no support system, no breaks. We made it through!

We combated the unknowns, not just the typical unknowns of being a FTM but scary ass questions like, will opening this package put my newborn at risk? If Im sick, how do I quarantine from my newborn? How do I keep this fragile little thing from harm?

We were forced to learn and set boundaries that we never WANTED to. Turning family away when they were unvaccinated. Only sending pictures during lockdown. Staying away from family we couldnt drive to for the sake of our health.

All this, while navigating the 4th trimester, fluctuating hormones and sleepless nights. Its been 2.5 years! We made it! Well continue to make it! We are amazing! We are it!","Mommit",471,471,0,0.94,2,0,0,111

Understandably people have strong feelings about her so I'm gonna address this up front and then not really go into it further in the comments- I have a baby who is about six months younger than Hartford, and I subscribed to Stassi and Beau's podcast shortly after I had her because I was feeling isolated and starved for relatable content from other new moms. Honestly I found it very helpful and refreshing, especially in those early days. As I got my feet under me, I found myself listening less, and as the topic of her cancellation resurfaced with the announcement and publication of her book, I was disappointed about her profiting off of what she did and everything I read in the media (I didn't read the book) about what she had to say about it. I thought I'd cancelled my Patreon subscription at that point, but it turns out I did not- hence, I still had access to listening to this latest podcast today, which I did and now I will be unsubscribing for real.

Okay, on to the interesting part! Here's the recap:

\-This episode isn't their official wedding recap, but more about the lead-up and addressing the rumors/headlines.

\-They are annoyed at the headlines painting it sensationally as ""X person DISINVITED from wedding- are they no longer friends?"" when in their opinion that implies a personal animosity that doesn't exist- it's two years later, relationships have changed, pandemic restrictions and concerns have affected everyone differently, they lost their jobs, and they have a child, so their main thing was wanting to have a wedding that was fiscally responsible reflecting all of those facts. They also reiterated again that Bravo does NOT pay for the weddings (or other events), so it's not so much a case of them going from having a wedding that is paid for to having one that is not- just that they don't have what was their main source of income anymore, plus they do have the expenses of a child to consider now.

\-Stassi was especially annoyed by the headlines about Scheana being disinvited, because she felt that was the media pitting two women against each other (hence much less coverage of Sandoval also not making the cut from the original guest list to the new one). She said Scheana gave her one of the nicest responses of everyone who didn't get an invite to the new smaller wedding- she was super understanding. They are clearly still on good terms- Stassi said ""all love for Scheana.""

\-Lala was invited and couldn't make it due to podcast tour. Lala offered to change her tour and felt really bad, but Stassi supported her keeping her work commitment. 

\-The big news is the Brittany and Jax stuff- to be clear, they never name who exactly they are talking about, but Stassi says she ""feels like listeners will be able to gather who it is on their own."" They also are not sure who has leaked some of the details about this situation to the media. 

\-Beau was getting texts from mutual friends with screenshots of convos with Jax beginning a month before the wedding saying they weren't going, listing a multitude of ""weird"" reasons they weren't going, but they had RSVP'd yes and every time they saw each other, they acted like they were going. 

\-The screenshots went on continuously for two weeks, at which point Stassi decided to address it directly (over text). At first Jax denied it, then admitted it when confronted with evidence. Then they reassured them that they were coming.

\-Apparently Jax said in a group chat that he didn't realize Beau was in, that he, Brittany, and the baby would be at a golf tournament the day after the wedding, and this came out a week before the wedding (post confrontation/reassurance). Beau and Stassi chose not to address it again at this point.

\-Brittany finally told them they weren't coming the day that Beau and Stassi left for Rome. It was a ""novel"" with ""many many reasons"" they weren't coming (Beau and Stassi didn't share any of the reasons). 

\-Beau said that Jax and Brittany would never talk to them again if him and Stassi ""pulled this bullshit"" with Jax and Brittany's wedding, which made me laugh and is very true.

\-Stassi said ""I feel stupid. I thought we were closer and better friends than that.""

\-In general it sounds like they are kind of done with Jax and Brittany, though they didn't say it that bluntly. Stassi said ""It's not about the fact they didn't come, it's that they didn't have enough love and respect for us to communicate it, and I'm not here for that.""

\-In general Stassi said that though she knows the VPR dynamics are what's going to draw the headlines, but that drama was not reflective of the trip and that wedding was incredible and they wouldn't change a thing. 

\-They also addressed the ""Stassi bought her way onto the NYT bestseller list"" headlines. She noted that it was funny that some of the headlines were gloating over how she couldn't afford the original wedding, but then they same publication would say she bought her way on to the list.

\-She acknowledged that her book had the dagger next to it, said she literally thought until now that that emblem was indicating the publishing house (Simon and Schuester). She called her publisher after seeing the story and basically the explanation was it was the books purchased in bulk for her live and virtual signing/meet and greet events. She cites one particular virtual signing that had more than 900 books purchased for it, one particular book signing that had 1,000+ people, and all the other book tour events, which she believes cumulatively account for getting the dagger. She also notes most of the books on the list have a dagger, because most of them are also doing signings and stuff.

Again, just want to clarify that  I personally am not saying any of this is the gospel truth or anything, just reporting what Stassi and Beau said.

Okay, that's only like a little more than half of the podcast but it's all I have had time to listen to and I think it's the main part addressing the rumors. Hope y'all enjoyed the tea!

ETA: I listened to the rest and it was just stuff about waiting too late to buy various clothes for Beau and Hartford, and a couple passport issues guests had. Only things that were interesting to me were 1) Beau only spent $300 on both of his suits (rehearsal and wedding) combined, and 2) Stassi was obsessed with Katies dress and Katie almost backed out of wearing it but Stassi pushed her to. Just wanted to finish the recap in case anyone had FOMO lol.","vanderpumprules",473,473,0,0.94,5,0,1,254

After just shy of four years moderating this community, I'm finally ready to retire. I got married last month, and the following week, my wife and I were standing in a used bookstore holding a pile of baby books (nothing official yet; just planning), and it hit me: I am definitely done moderating. My priorities are shifting rapidly to my new family, to my home, and to my geographic community instead of my online one. So it's time to call it quits.

My sincere hope is that you'll read this and ask, ""Who cares?"" Good moderation leaves a very light footprint, and if you never thought to learn my name, I'm glad for that. It's been a challenging time here. Moderating a subreddit like this one forces you to get very comfortable with nuance, and to learn how to draw boundaries not just for yourself, but for others. Not unlike parenting (I think), you have to solve conflicts with an eye for fairness and equity, with compassion for both parties, and in a way that leaves nobody humiliated or shamed. I wish I could say I always achieved that, but I think overall, I did a fair job of it. If you are among those who I let down (I can think of a few), I want to say that I'm sorry I couldn't pull it off, but there's a good chance I remember you, and I'm keeping the lessons I learned from those mistakes.

I've also participated as a member of this community for some years -- and I will likely continue to do so, minimally. But if I ever wrote something that helped you move the ball forward in your recovery, I am overjoyed. I am so grateful for the people who open themselves up here, who turn a listening ear towards this group, and who allow others to use their knowledge and wisdom to help them and thereby improve a world that so often refuses to be better. With so many people in my past who've refused to change and grow, I am so, so grateful and relieved to have found people who are searching for a better path. And I'm very happy to have traded notes with them.

I've worked with about a dozen other moderators in my time here, and I want to thank them for the time and effort they spent running this place. There was a very brief time where I was running the sub alone, so I can say from experience that it is far too much for one person, and this place wouldn't run without the team of volunteers that managed to hang on, even and especially during the pandemic, when the entire world experienced collective compassion fatigue. Special thanks to /u/gurneyhallack and /u/psychoticwarning, who each spent a stretch of several months where it was just two of us trying to keep the lights on here. Those were actually special times to me, and I'll have to do a little grieving that those times are past.

As for the future, the mod team is a little light on muscle right now, so if you feel up for moderating, keep an eye out for an upcoming recruitment drive. It's a hard job, but it's rewarding. I've grown tremendously from my time here, and I don't regret it in the slightest.

Over the years I've received an uncountable number of Thank you's and words of support, and I want to send a thank you right back. It's *very* easy, especially as a sufferer of CPTSD myself, to lose sight of how much good I was doing in a position like this. So thank you for the reminders and the encouragement. I needed it!

I think that'll do it for me. I'll be finishing out the week as a moderator, and that'll be it.

Thank you again.

Did they ever turn it around?","Please remove if not appropriate - I know this is a relationship question but we share a 6.5 year old daughter. 

From the beginning and for the majority of our relationship, my boyfriend was basically apathetic to politics. He did not vote and it was not something we talked about frequently. His viewpoint on basically everything (abortion, LGBT) was doesnt effect me/not my business/live and let live.

COVID hit our family extremely hard. He lost his job (has since gotten another, better one), we lost a lot of money, our relationship suffered and has not recovered. Since the beginning of the pandemic he has latched onto Covid conspiracy theories, Joe Rogan etc. I do not agree with it but was empathetic as Im also angry about the pandemic and the pain it caused. Myself and our daughter are vaccinated, AS IS HE although he claims to be extremely against it, believes it is poisonous and put inside us to hurt us.

The past month or two however he has come out of the woodwork with beliefs I have never heard from him. Basically the devils advocate position on every single topic. First it was Black History month. Then it was some rant about how men should be the head of the household. Trans people - we literally dont even know any trans people, why does he even need to weigh in at all?. Last night it was abortion and how I believe in killing babies and women need to be held accountable for their actions. Very early in our relationship we had a conversation where we both agreed that we are pro choice, I was actually the MORE conservative one at the time saying I didnt think I would ever personally consider having an abortion, but that I supported the right for others to do so. I dont want to hear these rants for the rest of my life and I dont want my daughter to hear them. Im horrified that she hears him complain about her learning very normal, appropriate things at school (for example MLK jr). Has anyone else been through this? Is there any coming back from this?

I'm nowhere near my family or friends when I need them most, and while I am an introvert, I have felt so incredibly lonely. My step mum is dying, which has been horrible for us, and the pandemic meant I couldn't go out there to see her when she was healthy for the last time. She's been my mum since I was about ten. Now, she is not herself. She is weak and vulnerable, and very depressed. It has really hurt to know that I didn't get to see her one more time as the person I know. 

I struggle with alcoholism, passed down to me from my real mother, who abandoned me when I was a kid, for a junky who killed himself, sending her further into her addiction. 

I have felt angry, sad, and hard done by this last year in particular. I haven't cried in so long. I bury my feelings, like so many others. I'm the funny friend.

My sister had a baby recently and due to her being up all night, she texted me something pretty casual tonight:

""hey! I am up with the baby. Miss you little bro. Hope you're taking care of yourself. It's cool to know that you're probably awake right now while everyone here is asleep. Anyway, ignore my tired ramblings. Love ya! Xx""

Out of nowhere, I got this overwhelming feeling of love. My sister loves me. My parents love me. My siblings love me. My daughter loves me. And I love them too. So damn much. It just hit me so hard. While I have felt distant and down, I haven't stepped back to just recognize how lucky I am that I have someone like my sister who chooses to text me when she's feeling loopy and newborn tired. Even typing it doesn't do it justice. I felt elated. And then came the tears. I laid on my couch and cried. That opened the flood gates. I cried and cried. I think I cried enough tears to make up for the last ten years.

Today I will attempt to give a thorough explanation of how I am now making 6 figures despite having a **fine arts degree**.  I am very happy to share with you one of my biggest successes to date.

This is very long, but I hope that it is helpful!

&amp;#x200B;

**Introduction**

A ton of people that I graduated with did not end up working in a lucrative position in this field. In fact, many (I would say around 90%) did not end up working in a related field at all. 

I fully believe that following Nevilles teachings has been the determining factor in my success.  Yes, I would say I have also worked for my success and am good at my job.  But I feel that one factor would not have happened without the other.  So lets begin.

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

I have had a strong belief through my entire working life that I always attract the perfect job for where I am at the moment. This belief has been repeatedly proven true, and I have quickly and easily won jobs that were fun, convenient, and just what I needed at the time.  I can talk about some of these past successes in a different diary.

&amp;#x200B;

**Graduation**

I graduated college with my art degree and an entry level job offer where I made around $50,000. I worked at that job for about 3 years before I felt the need / confidence to move up from this position.  

During my nightly SATS, I pictured myself getting the **promotion** plus a **$10,000 raise**. At the time, a $10,000 raise felt realistic to me.  I felt the admiration of my coworkers and peers, congratulating me for my success.

After a few months, February came.  This meant  time for my performance reviews (in real life). My manager and his manager thanked me for my good work and wanted to offer me a promotion and a significant raise. I happily thanked them and looked forward to the future.  

*However*, the promotion never came, because the pandemic and lockdowns hit. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Fuck 2020**

Seeing everything that was going on, it was hard for me to be ungrateful.  People were losing their jobs, getting sick, and losing loved ones.  At my job, there were hundreds of layoffs and furloughs (its a large, Fortune 500esque company). 

I think my beliefs still held my job and finances in place and on pause during this time.  I tried to be content, but I couldnt lie to myself, because ultimately I wanted more.  Raises, promotions, and bonuses never came at my job and I grew bitter and resentful.  The news was hard for me to avoid in these unprecedented times.  With every week came a new tragic update.

Being this uncomfortable in 2020, it became very hard for me to believe my visualizations. I forgot about my mental diet and just kind of watched everything that was going on in fear and confusion.  It was a hard time for everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Taking a Pause**

I decided to shelf this project.  I had too much stress, heartbreak and turmoil because of the events of 2020.  It was hard for me to focus and even really believe in the law at all. How could this be real when there are so many people suffering right now? 

I couldnt manifest anything because I was hopeless.  I had no belief in myself or even the world at this time.  TBH the world is still scary sometimes, but I have a stronger grasp on my mental diet now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Baby Steps**

Around October of 2020, after a solid 10 months of unhappiness, I made the choice to build myself, my self esteem, and my belief back again.  

I worked on meditation, being grateful for small things, and staying positive for the future.  I had to build my belief up from the ground up again.  Heres what I did: 

&amp;#x200B;

**Steps I Took to go from 0-100:** 

* **Listening** to Neville Goddard: The Complete Reader on audible. (You can read all of the books for free, but I love and prefer audiobooks. ) 
* My favorite Neville **book** is The Law and the Promise.  I listen and re-listen to this often. (Once again, you can read this for free if you dont want to spend money)
* I like to listen to the audiobooks during my **morning walks**/workouts.  During these times, I like to do walking visualizations.  Have you ever been in class, but your mind wasnt in class? Daydreaming during a meeting? This is the same type of process/idea. *(Please dont zone out too much, because it can become dangerous if you arent in a safe place)*
* **Daily SATS**: Midday, I listen to ocean sounds or something soothing.  I lay down on my bed or couch and clear my mind of everything for 15-30 minutes.  At first, I didnt do SATS visualizations with this (Just meditating) but now I do. I didnt do them at first because my goal at first was just to relieve stress.  I repeat this process before bed with SATS visualization as well. 
* **Nightly Journaling:** To build up my belief in the law, I started recording all of my manifestations, big or small. ANYTHING I have ever manifested.  I would give myself daily manifestation homework and record those successes. I also like to draw my desires. Sometimes I script, but Im usually too lazy. The journaling helps me prepare for SATS visualization more easily.
* **Manifestation Homework:** For me these are smaller items.  I believe Neville gave the example of a baseball or tennis ball to test out manifestation. The Secrets example is a cup of coffee or a parking space.  Everyday I work on a small manifestation.  Things such as butterflies, a certain song, a certain person, a number, a conversation topic, etc. I record these successes in my journal.
* **Soft Affirmations**: I like to call my affirmations soft affirmations.  This is because I dont really force myself to do them. I usually just choose one or two. I write them in my journal sometimes. I chose I make $100,000 a year and Money comes to me freely and easily.  Sometimes they pop into my head during the day and I just kind of savor them. 

This is it.  There really isnt anything groundbreaking..  I am also very chill about all of these items.  Sometimes I miss a day or two, but overall I am pretty consistent. 

&amp;#x200B;

**The Necessary Mindset for Manifestation**

**I do not worry** about if my process worked.  **I dont wait** for my thing or wonder where its at.  **I dont even think about** it unless its one of those specific times.  I just live my life, and then the desire comes into my life easily, oftentimes when I havent thought about it at all in a while.  

I focus on contentment. **I dont resent** my current 3D reality. I try to find the good in everything, even in things that I dislike. 

If you dont like something, change it.  If you cant change it, change the way you think about it. - Maya Angelou 

&amp;#x200B;

**Putting it into practice**

At first, my goal was to 1) stop being so stressed / unhappy and 2) strengthen my belief.  This took me about 3-ish months, but I felt myself becoming happier and believing in myself more.  It was time to pick up the money manifestation again. 

I realized that my job wasn't going to give me the promotion, and I really didnt want to stay there anyways. I no longer liked the leadership.  Around the 2021 New Year, I started focusing on a bigger fish.  I wanted a new job, and I wanted $100,000. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Money Comes to Me Freely and Easily**

It took me a few months to prepare for my job, but even in that time, I started to see movement in my world.  My first manifestation was really weird.  

I got a random notification in Cash App.  I received $1, **from a person I DONT KNOW**\- with the note: 

I believe in your ability 

WHAT. THE. F. I swear I'm not making this up.

I think Ive stated this before, but I dont tell people in my real life about this work.  I dont want them to think Im weird lol. So this was a truly random manifestation.  

I felt the twilight zone music, but I took this as a sign.  I believe in my ability too.  Lol.  I have a few screenshots of just random money Ive received out of thin air (through cashapp and other means)  throughout the year. A LOT of these are from people I dont know, situations I didnt know, etc.  I dont want to detail every occasion, ( I would be here too long)  so here are some of those thrown together here:

[Cashapp screenshots](https://preview.redd.it/crv14di9ig091.jpg?width=945&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bf2b2cd73648389088fbd063f80f7cd55c011ba4)

&amp;#x200B;

**Two Weeks** 

I began working on my resume and in a few months, I was ready to start the process.  My type of job also requires a portfolio, so I spent a few months working on that too. Around May, I was ready to go.

Interviews came VERY easily.  I had several interviews daily, with several companies. In the process I found a great job at an interesting company with amazing, fun people. The interview process was quick, and I got my job offer.

&amp;#x200B;

**$90,000**

The job offered me **$90,000.** 

You know, it wasn't what I was expecting. I genuinely felt I was worth the $100,000 and it was what I had been prepping for in all of my Law of attraction work. 

BUT.  I was exhausted lol.  Also, why would I turn down a nearly **$40,000 pay increase** when there were so many other positives? I accepted the offer and started my new job soon after.  **I went from $55k to $90k**.  Honestly, it felt pretty good!  I started that summer.

&amp;#x200B;

**6 months later, $10k raise.**

So, after working at my job for 6 months something wild happened.  My manager pulled me aside for an impromptu meeting (impromptu for me at least ) .  He thanked me for my good work and wanted to offer me a promotion and a significant raise.  He said I was even more valuable than they originally thought.

I got my **raise of $10k** (what I had been visualizing at my old job a year and a half before I even started at the new one) AND the **total yearly salary of $100,000**.  The promotion also came with quarterly bonuses, so by the end of the year I will have made over $100k. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Moral of the Story**

Things can work out in ways that can surprise you.  They did for me!  If you are struggling, perhaps what I did will work for you.  I started with cultivating some calmness, peace, and happiness for myself.  Then, after building up my belief and expectation, the other things started coming in easily.  Please notice how my other two stories have happened very recently after starting this process. 

*Do you believe in your ability?*

For a long time, I kind of did. Start proving to yourself that you can do anything.  Beautiful, magical things can start happening :)

The past few years have felt incredibly isolating and lonely.

My (31F) parents (68M &amp; 66F) and older sister (38F) have become consumed by conspiracy theories and have become increasingly more destructive in the past year. They live in a different state and I live in Florida with my husband and our baby. 

Some background - I grew up in the Deep South and subscribed to conservative ideology and was a registered Republican until I was 22; Sandy Hook was my awakening moment and Ive been a registered democrat ever since. My family still consider themselves conservative, including my large extended family of 40 first cousins. Up until the pandemic, weve been able to avoid any large political arguments.

Unfortunately, the past few months have shown me that the family I once knew is gone and the likelihood of these relationships returning is extremely low, if not completely non-existent. Disney has been my employer since I was 21 and Im sure as yall are aware, extremists have now directed all their latest campaigns towards Disney. Its virtually impossible for to have a conversation with my parents or sister without these conspiracies being brought up. The day after the Oscars, my mother asked to FaceTime to see the baby. I made a comment about the Oscars slap, which then immediately opened the floodgates of her explaining that it was some type of secret signal. I asked her to please stop talking to me about this because its exhausting and she agreed. I thought we had reached a truce until a few days later when we FaceTimed again. I mentioned Titanic as the 110th anniversary is coming up, thinking we would just talk about Leonardo DiCaprio and Billy Zane and reminisce about her taking me to see the movie when I was 7. Apparently I was naive because she began going off about some Q conspiracy about the sinking being done on purpose to kill John Jacob Aster; she then went on to make herself angry about this fake scenario where the sinking happened in 2022 and instead of the officers allowing women and children to board first, they were only loading liberals and members of the LGBTQ community. Im literally at a loss for words for how idiotic it was. I hung up angry and defeated - it became very obvious at this point that they are physically incapable of talking about anything else. My dad then sent me an absurd amount of texts with articles about this conspiracy as well as memes of Billy Zanes I have a child scene except in this case Billy Zane was saying things like Im trans, Im liberal, vaccinated, etc. This royally pissed me off considering real people died, including children. 

Just today, I woke up to 5 texts from my dad with articles about this supposed pedophile ring located under Magic Kingdom and how the fire department located on Disney property is actually part of some weird operation to kidnap children. None of this is based in reality; the only thing located under Magic Kingdom is garbage and a Subway. It doesnt matter how many times I tell them they are wrong and that Ive been under Magic Kingdom multiple times, they tell me Im naive and I dont know what Im talking about. 

Ive reached the point where I no longer want them in my life but Im not sure what to do. This feud has bled out into other areas with them attempting to weaponize my baby against me, saying things like Im an unfit mother and that I clearly dont know what Im doing. My husband and I just bought our first home, a new build, and I wasnt able to share any of this excitement with them because I knew it would be used against me in the future. There is some enmeshment and Im trying to navigate how to go about all of this. Were currently all on the same phone plan as it was cheaper this way; Im going to look into getting my own with my husband and trying to find a way to keep the same number (Ive had it since I was 14 lol). Their only contact with me at this point is rage farming.

Anyway, I know this was long but it feels good to finally get it all out to people who understand. My husband tries his best but hes never experienced this and doesnt understand how devastating it came be. Im too embarrassed to talk to my friends about this since they know my family as well. Ive talked to my therapist a lot but other than that, Ive felt totally alone. 

TL;DR - family overtaken by Q and are past the point of no return. Feeling sad.","QAnonCasualties",458,458,0,0.99,0,0,0,107

It is what it is. Recent events of Roe being overturned have awoken a next level of understanding of the novel and show. 

My fiancé seems to be unmoved by the historical moment I became a second class citizen yesterday, and I feel resentful of that. 

I find myself naturally making excuses for him because he and I have vastly different experiences and perspectives of what the real world is out there. I remind myself that hes sort of a pampered baby that grew up in a completely affluent lifestyle whereas I grew up not too far from a trailer park at every corner had my parents not been financially literate and frugal. I feel like I see something here that he just cant. 

Example: he seems to think that this will just be a no big deal matter of crossing state lines for needed medical services. He cant see the fact that Albuquerque, NM is already buckling, unable to provide medical services needed for their own citizens as well as the population of TX that actually have resources to travel to Albuquerque for a needed  procedure/prescription. He cant fathom that there exists an entire population across the entire country that was already disenfranchised before yesterday which served only to damn these populations into destitution, despair and ruin from here on. 

Yeah. Whereas before I had trouble relating to Junes aversion to Luke because of his complete absence of outrage&I now fully understand why June was so disgusted and internally conflicted from her sudden changed perception of her own husband. His response to (or lack thereof) the gender crisis of epic historical significance was absolutely inappropriate, especially in hindsight.

This sudden realization really reminds me of just how talented Atwood truly is at world and character building. This was such a nuanced and contextually driven aspect of Gilead rising. 

Praise beunder His eye.

ETAFor reference, I live in a red state that started to screw around with the abortion laws right at the start of the pandemic. All I can think is, Funny how two years ago my state saw some sort of writing on the walls. And now Im sitting here typing, I shouldve believed it.

**If you are a financially independent legal adult you have ZERO need to go to events that are going to be miserable abuse sessions.**

The following apply to you:

* You are a grown-ass adult with your own agency and bodily autonomy.
* You are NOT obligated to keep showing up to ""holiday tradition"" torture sessions just because ""we've always done it this way"".
* Someone made up these ""traditions"" 20, 40, 50 whatever years ago because *it was convienient for them and suited their fantasies and kinks and delusions of what faaaamily means to them*. It's all fake and made up.
* You are allowed, in fact you are obligated, to make new traditions that bring YOU joy and happiness. Be that new traditions with your partner, friends, pets, yourself, or whoever. If you would be happier staring at a wall, that's your new tradition.
* You have bodily autonomy, you do not have to accept touch from anyone you do not want, regardless if that is an adult or a baby. No means no in this context as well.
* Just because a partner wants to go to their traditional family suckfest -- *you have zero obligation to go with them.*
* If a partner is telling you or implying anything like the following: ""but you have to come because if you don't I'll have to explain to my family why you are not there"", ""I'll have to deal with them alone (read: if I throw you to them as fresh meat I get to sit back and relax)"", ""I need you to run interference, provide a distraction, be a target yourself so they won't target me"", ""you need to be my therapist/emotional support pet so I can get through the day"", etc. THAT SHIT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE in a partner. They need to stop using you, get therapy and fix their own shit. 
* A true partner who respects you and loves you and considers you their primary family demonstrates that by *proactively offering to solve their own family bullshit, and if they cannot solve it, to give you an easy out.* All it takes is a simple: ""Hey, so for &lt;reasons&gt; I would like to go see my family on Xmas day, however we both know that they are crazy and that the kids are horrible, so I'm not willing to put you through that. So I would like us to celebrate Xmas together the day after, and I'll go deal with my nutjob family the day of, while you do whatever the hell you want for fun.""
* If the ONLY reason you are going is because people are yelling at you because they have cast you into a particular role in their fake happy family cosplay pageant... they don't love you and you shouldn't go. You are not obligated to cosplay/LARP with idiots who don't actually care about you. (Protip: If it's nothing but an acting job for you, and you're not getting paid, then you shouldn't be going and working for free.)
* If there are certain family members you want to see and have in your life, make new traditions with them separately. Yes, when you were a kid the only time you got to see granny was when your parents said so and took you there, which was on holidays. But you are a grown ass adult and you can drive/uber your own ass over there now. Make a new tradition that you take granny to the movies in January. You and your favorite cousin make plans to do mini-golf in October every year. Whatever, it's up to you and the people you want to see. You are in charge now.
* Set and enforce boundaries and BRING THE PAIN of you stepping away/setting the terms. Pain is the only teacher morons will ever listen to if they will listen to anything. If you think that they are going to change any other way when they have not done so over your lifetime, forget it. **You can't ""nice"" abusers out of abusing you.**
* As a legal and financially independent adult YOU CONTROL your family relationships now. Either they are in your life on your terms, or they are out and that's their choice. DNA doesn't give them the right to abuse you or force their way into your life. You get to say no. You get to set the rules.
* Yes, it is going to be hard to set your boundaries and make changes the first few times, but then you will figure out that having this power is awesome and you will love it. So sack up and do it. It will get easier quickly.
* Yes, the people who are fundamentally decent people, just being buttheads or with a misguided approach will accept the new order of things in time. They will gripe for a year or three, but once you establish that this is ""our new tradition, my partner and I"" or whatever... they will get on with life.
* The crazy abusers will of course NOT adapt. And they are outing themselves as being abusers who only want to use you for their own cosplay/social reasons. At which point they have shown you that they do not respect you, do not love you and you can walk away in peace and focus your time and attention on people who do love and respect you.
* You are not the proverbial little kid standing there with the empty porridge bowl begging ""please love me/accept me/don't abuse the crap out of me"" anymore. You are an adult. The only place you get approval from is yourself now.
* Life is too short to have the emotional crap beat out of you every holiday. Stop letting people do that to you. 
* Don't be a doormat.

P.S.: If you're not ready to set boundaries yet, feel free to use the ""Tested positive for covid, too bad!"" excuse. Damn pandemic may as well be useful for something as long as we're stuck with it.","childfree",456,456,0,0.99,2,0,0,81

So literally all that happened was you were politely asked to stay home for 14 days, recommended to wear a mask, and given the option of the vaccine. That's all it was. Don't trust the massive debt you see from your job having been taken away. Don't ask where the missing people are, who died from suicide. Don't question why there's a massive increase in childhood underdevelopment.

We were supposed to celebrate my birthday this weekend. I couldnt celebrate my 21st because the pandemic hit and everything shutdown.  For my 22nd I had talked for years how I wanted to go all out because Im born on the 22nd, I had spoken to my mom months prior that I wanted a huge party for and Ill pay for everything including decorations and food but if she could just organize it. She said sure. I kept reminding her and 3 days prior to my birthday she asked if I still wanted to celebrate. I immediately canceled everything because she wanted to leave everything last minute. My bf felt so bad so this year for my 23rd he wanted to take control. He wanted to travel 3 hours away to somewhere special. I declined because I didnt want to be far from the baby. The baby would have to stay with my mom. 

My mom makes it seem like Im a helicopter parent but I just want things done my way. What I ask for isnt unreasonable. All I ask is for her to let me know the times of her diaper changes, feedings, how much she ate, and the times of her naps. Fast forward to my birthday weekend, my bf and I decided to stay local but have her watch the baby just for a few hours. I told my mom my rules and she made the comment when shes with me, we do things the way I want to do them. I checked her real quick and told her the baby wont be staying here and well gladly leave and I dont care how many children shes had, they all turned out terrible but she will follow my rules or she wont stay. I know it sounds harsh but we dont have the best relationship and my mom tries to poop on my parenting style. She also has an issue that my baby takes breast milk and not formula. 

Anyways, 2 hours after I left I call my sister to see how everything is going. All I hear is crying and screaming. I panic asking where is my mom and whats wrong with the baby. My sister was struggling with my nephew who is just a toddler and the baby who needed a diaper change and a nap. She said my mom has been at the store for the past hour and a half. I have horrible anxiety and while I love my sister, I didnt leave her in charge nor did I want to overwhelm her. My mom didnt let me know at all. I didnt say anything, canceled my plans for the evening, picked up my baby and left. I got a one word text from my mom sorry. I find out from my sister that she was explaining she didnt mean for her errands to take long and why did I have to take her. The following day she sends a voice memo apologizing and giving excuses. I have not responded and my bf and I spoke and decided we will no longer have her watch our baby.","AmItheAsshole",446,446,0,0.92,0,0,0,120

Maybe it's hormones, maybe it's because I don't have parents but I'm devastated.

So mother's day was Sunday, and Father in law grabbed Mother in laws gifts from us to give to her Thursday. He got home put it on their table and went to the bathroom, she immediately ripped it open without a call or thought of us. 

We haven't seen them since December 2020 because they do not take the pandemic seriously. We have an immune compromised 4 year old who's safety comes first. We've asked them to avoid going to concerts or packed bars if they want to see him after, just don't go to anything with over 30 people the week before you want to see him- they haven't yet and it's been 18 months.

So, anyways, there was a card, a candle, purple salt (favorite color and seasoning for her), and a 22k gold floating locket, you know, the one with the charms that free float all over? I had been working on it since December- it's May now. I had an engraved charm with their wedding date made, a custom boarder collie for their dog made, a group charm of all their cats (8!), her favorite flower and bird, some generic ones as well; a heart that says family, grandma charm and- *real gem stone chips in the shape of hearts for every members birth month, over 12 people's birth gemstones in little hearts*. Our son was the only one born in the diamond month so it wasn't too expensive but was easily over $400 for sure (I lost track with how many different charms I had made). 

Here's the thing though, I'm over 5 months pregnant. 22 weeks. We added a little sapphire heart to the locket for when we are expecting- September. The only other month with no one else in the family.

She didn't wait for mother's day, or even call us after she opened it, we called her late that night because son wanted to say goodnight and then she sprang it on us that she loved it. Husband and I were super upset and basically said alright tell grandma goodnight, son did and husband hung up. 

Am I crazy or was that completely ridiculous? I've already made it 5 months and she just ruined her own announcement- why am I even telling her anyways? Husband is super upset and feels disrespected, he hasn't talked to her since except a half-assed ""happy mother's day."" Text on Sunday.

Husband still wants to do an announcement for her but... I put in so much effort to make it perfect and spent so much time on it for it to be this stressful. Why? Why would I do it again? It's not like she'll notice one little blue heart when the locket is packed with over 30 charms. I'm not too worried about her finding out that way.

I'm partially feeling vindictive and want to post it on Facebook that we're expecting and have her feel left out because we didn't tell her, (she's obsessed with having more grandkids) and I know seeing it rather than us telling her would be hurtful- but I'm gutted! Hormones? 

She will be upset we don't tell her, but it's not for our lack of trying! If she had common sense or basic respect for us this wouldn't have even been an issue. I'm not doing anything else for her.


Edit: thank you all for your sweet/harsh words. Lessons learned, no more above and beyond for those who aren't trying to be active in our lives. I should've clearly marks the card ""open this first and read it,"" then wrote on the gift box ""call the people who got you this before you open,"" to avoid the whole problem and it wouldn't have brought these other issues to the surface all at once.

I have been clinging to try to make up for the family I do not have, and husband has been trying to please her for way too long (he's a boy mom -son if that explains it, he'll work on it! And yes, I got an equally nice mother's day gift and day together!). 

We have a plan of action but it does depend on them. Our therapist is going to go through a game plan with us so we can be prepared any way it goes, telling her in the next week over the phone, (I don't see this one happening honestly, they aren't home often and it would require both of them there at the same time and getting the necklace out of the attic), in person in June (depends on concerts and friends parties, but probably a 50/50 chance), or even after birth if we can't get a hold of them by then (not my top pick, but we'd be treating them like everyone else). They take a month long- no tech camping vacation in late June/early July, we aren't going this year (it's usually 50+ people) so I'm unsure of exact dates might clash with days we can see them that I'm still up for it the later it gets. You guys are right though, we need to tone it down to get on their level, simpler the better.

We are hoping to see them in June, soft plans -if bon Jovi or Metallica comes to town we may be out of luck, but then again so will they. I'm hoping to have Fil grab necklace out of storage and bring it so husband can go over it with her and maybe toss in a ""I thought you would be more excited about it!"" But we'll see if they are able to avoid masses of people the week before. 

Maybe I have rose colored glasses on, maybe it's orphan syndrome lol, while it is hurtful (no calls, no reaching out, not even looking at the necklace, not calling husbands birthday), I am not sure she's being malicious, maybe just clueless. 

I should've clarified a few things, I have had 6 losses at various stages with one live birth, our 4 year old who loves her very much, he sends her voice messages everyday. (He can't text yet and I call everytime he asks) I'm not going to stop contact between them, she's his favorite person. She had also been very caring and helpful in those difficult moments during our losses and while she seems uncaring I'm not sure we aren't just out of sight out of mind. And, yes, that's hurtful. But it could be how she is and husband will address it with her in person after he sorts out his feelings at his appointment.

After all the losses I push back our announcements each time, to be sure the next would stick after the previous loss and we haven't made it in the clear yet, but is there really ever a clear? After miscarriage there's birth defect or even still birth. Ugh. I had wanted to surprise all non immediate family with a ""hey, guess what we had,"" boom- baby! But still let a few supportive helpful individuals know after 20 weeks. We are comfortable with more people knowing in July but we'll see if I get anymore complications (I'm sure added stress will help with that/s).

Husband isn't going to drop them, especially since they will be moving to the lower condo we bought and Fil is fixing up custom for them. They should be moved in in August or September (I assure you, we will be having two separate households and visits will remain the same as long as we need to be cautious-we live less than 5 minutes away rn) it won't be easy, but they won't even have a key to our home. I will support my husband as long as we remain a team and he is supportive of me as I am of him. But I did want to fight when he cried (this morning when we were filling details to talk about with our family therapist and his single -shortly before I wrote this, he feels so disappointed and let down- that was the hormones I think because it was days ago and I wasn't any more emotional than a *really?* Towards her but him crying and I was ready to scream at them when I was just bummed Thursday). But we agree he will be handling them as long as I'm in delicate health.


Honestly- thank you guys for your advice some of it even got husband to laugh which he's been tense the last few days, so really thank you. Everyone one of you thank you, some said what I needed to hear, some were sweet enough I cried, - except the antivaxxer who wants me to sacrifice my son. I'm sure we have many different parenting strategies, mine just involves me keeping my son alive. Not sorry, and I'll do it again all over if need be. P.S. they will need to get boosters, and test before seeing our newborn = be mad. 

As of right now, we're just chilling till we get a chance for clarification from Fil to see if it is malicious or if she's just..... An air head I guess? FIL has known about pregnancy as well, he saw us carting in baby stuff in one day from our garage while he was working on the house. I'm positive he won't say anything though unless we ask him. He knew this was an announcement as well. If they were home more often together I'd even ask him to have her probe the necklace but there's no way they'll have a chance before at the earliest June, and by then we may as well just wait to see them in person if we're able.

[**How can I announce my pregnancy without hurting my friend who had a stillborn?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/fwxaj6/how_can_i_announce_my_pregnancy_without_hurting/) - submitted on 08 Apr 2020 in /r/askwomenadvice 

Throwaway because I want to keep this on the very DL from my main account. 

About a month so, a closed friend of mine announced that she had lost her baby at 7 months gestation. It came as a complete shock, obviously. More so because the week she announced it was her baby shower. It all was devastating to hear and with the pandemic, I couldnt visit her at all. 

My fiancé and I had been trying but we didnt tell anybody. I found out I was pregnant a few weeks before my friend lost her baby. We found out today that were having twins and were eager to share the news. 

That being said, I feel like I shouldnt because of my friend. It feels like Ill be rubbing it in, which Im totally not, but I know the news will probably hit hard since its all so recent. 

I care about her and her mental health and I dont know how to go about it. My sister suggested to privately talk to her and make her aware of the announcement so it doesnt come as a surprise.

[**Response to OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/fwxaj6/how_can_i_announce_my_pregnancy_without_hurting/fmqzg4f/)

Having spent years going through infertility with no positive outcome, take your sister's advice. Tell her privately before you post to any social media, as that would have sentence in to a tail spin emotionally.

That being said if she has to distance herself from you for a bit (not go to a baby shower, not want to talk to you about the experience) just let it go. It's really hard to show up and pretend at an event and spend a week crying afterwards. That does go away eventually so don't be too unkind when you dont hear from her for a bit.

When I met my (now) husband, he had a stable job in a construction company. He was very clear and open with me that during his teen years he had an alcohol and drug problem. He was kicked out of his parents house when he was 15 because he was old enough and couched surfed for years until he could afford a place. 

Between those years, he slept in friends houses who would party hard and have all kinds of drugs. He was around it all and decided to try it. He has been clean for about 6 years. 

Recently we were watching a movie and a scene where this lady does a few lines of coke came up. He didnt mention anything then but, last night he broke drown (lots of stress from work) and said he had been craving using ever since the movie. He said that consciously he didnt want to do it but he craved it. His statement scared me because he knows Ive been around heavy users my whole life and knows how I feel about it. Were also expecting twins in about a month and I cant handle it all on my own. 

I love him to death but I dont know what would happen if he started to use again. 

Any advice?

So, nobody asked for this update but I felt like it needs it. 

I ended up waiting till I was about 6-7 months to announce my pregnancy versus the initial 3 months. My friend took the news good and was happy for me. I didnt expect her not to be happy for me but I expected her to not want to talk to me for a bit. It was the complete opposite. We started to talk more after my announcement and she would ask how I felt and how everything was going. I can even say we got very close after it too. Couple weeks after my announcement, she told me that she was pregnant again but didnt want to get too excited nor tell a lot of people but that she told me because she felt like Id have positive vibes for her. 

I was obviously super happy for her and told her if she needed anything to ask. During this time, I helped her get a necklace with her sons ashes in it. She wanted one but couldnt afford it. I suggested to make a gofundme but she felt nobody would donate because it wasnt a worthy cost. I assured her that it was and that people loved her and would love to help. She ended up making it and was able to pay for the necklace, I helped her with the initial payment of that. 

After my children were born, she would message me every other day to ask how they we were doing and asking for pictures of them. I can confidently say that shes an adoptive aunt for my children as she cares for them and loves them a lot.  

She had her own baby about a month ago and Im so so happy for her. Her baby is so cute and looks just like her. This pregnancy had some complications but Im glad they checked on her more and being a high risk pregnancy myself, I was able to mentor her as well. 

All in all, our friendship is stronger and closer than ever.

[**My MIL makes my children less than her other grandchild.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/mj6z52/my_mil_makes_my_children_less_than_her_other/) - submitted on 03 Apr 2021 in /r/NewParents 

Not sure if I worded the title right but lately Ive been feeling that my MIL sees and does more for her daughters (SIL) child than mine.

The grandkids are a year and a half apart. She has seen my children like a handful of times (5 maybe) since they were born (now 6 months) versus her other grandchild whom she babysits twice a week. Im asking for her to see them and nothing more. Shes the type of person who buys your love and Im assuming thats why she hasnt come around much. Its easier (and cheaper) to buy gifts for one child versus two but Ive told her she doesnt need to buy them anything. I just cant help but feel sad for my children. As someone who grew up not having any type of relationship with my fathers mother, I cant help but feel a cycle building up.

Am I overreacting? Have anybody else experienced this?

My children see my mother more because shes helping me out while I work so, she lives with us. Even though I love that, I wish they would see their other grandmother more and it just hurts me, in a way, that they wont have that close bond.


[**Response to OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/mj6z52/my_mil_makes_my_children_less_than_her_other/gt8lr65/) 

I agree, this is a pretty normal thing with husbands moms vs wifes moms. I think it comes down to they are more comfortable being with their daughters vs their daughter in laws. I think a lot of mils dont want to step on toes. It doesnt necessarily mean that she doesnt love your kids, shes just more comfortable with her daughters.

I have a SIL that felt the same way about our MIL. It has really affected their relationship and she thinks her MIL hates her. I have talked to MIL about it, she really loves her, but shes more comfortable with her own daughters.

Dont take it personally, thats what I think at least. I for sure go to my MIL with stuff, but Im going to talk to my mom first about anything, because she is my mom. Im sure you do the same.

I hope that all makes sense!

Edit to add: if you want her to come over, invite her over. She may be wanting to come, but may be waiting for an invite.

[**My (f30) marriage is failing and I dont know what to do.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/s7krgx/my_f30_marriage_is_failing_and_i_dont_know_what/) - submitted on 19 Jan 2022 in relationship_advice

We have 15 month old twins and our life before was great. We had fun and loved spending time with each other. Now, I feel like Im a burden to him. 

We have been having problems for a while now but they have escalated recently. My main problem with him is not helping out with the kids or the home. He thinks taking care of the kids is a chore and he should just do 50% of it while I do 100% of everything else. His 50% is changing one poopy diaper a day and MAYBE taking out the trash when I tell him. It has become so frustrating that I told him we needed marriage counseling or were done. 

I feel insane. He says he does so much for the kids and around the house yet I find myself doing it all. All of this on top of my full time job and going to school. He spends most of his free time playing COD screaming and cursing all day. He prioritizes his gaming over us. If I ask him to do two things in a day, he gets upset and says Do I have to do everything now? We have talked about how I feel and how he feels but nothing has changed. We got into an argument couple weeks ago where he said he didnt love me anymore and that he hated me. We didnt talk for a few days until I gathered the courage to tell him how I felt. Him saying that to me has been eating at me and have made me not want to try anymore. He swears he doesnt remember but if he did, he didnt mean it.

We have an appointment set up for this weekend and Im not sure how itll go. I already feel checked out because the problems are still there and the way he acts/talks, makes me feel he doesnt care anymore. Has counseling really helped people? I dont have faith in it but Im truly hoping it brings out a solution.

This last earnings report was horrendous BUT there are some interesting clues in the earnings call we will get to later.

Lets start with Ryan's letter to Bed Bath:

[https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf)

Some highlights here. The letter starts out setting the table that management has been garbage with giving returns to shareholders and throws a TON of shade on the CEO.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ai3z1jnsret81.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=63345d3c008acad73a1e6b2a70339130d7373e5c

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gzxqayz2set81.png?width=1122&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=42a0f39ee309af29f09c4075c4d37cce78e81e2f

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/98h42lq9set81.png?width=1117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1480dfced305c03a5fa450d78506eb8c8cd938bc

TLDR the CEO is only destroying the company. Returns are down in the market and sales are down while other retailers are doing the numbers they were doing before the pandemic, thus making the pandemic not an excuse for not executing. He goes on to point out the lack of insider ownership:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j6lihbftset81.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a7097b45991d6fa7ce8d2b61275a7b30c54dcf15

Now for the juicy stuff:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/k1krk194tet81.png?width=1056&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=76b0c4e57873005d45fa28619a56ecead22ba415

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z9p6dreptet81.png?width=1081&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=8f1b6e7d9123e4f255f3afd2b600eac6ce7dd901

The long of the short here is the market is valuing BBBY so low because the company IS going that direction right now. No insiders are buying, the company has little cash and cannot deploy cash to buy backs and invest in its infrastructure and continue to grow its brands all at the same time. THEY NEED CASH. So how do they get the cash? They sell BABY

How much cash can they raise with BABY though? Here is Ryan's thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/my4juvjguet81.png?width=1127&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d5e0d486e23952920e71f79919416f516a8b33b9

Here is what Ryan is saying BABY is worth. Shout out to shark tank for always spamming 5x multiples at everyone when they say their biz is worth 5 million bucks on 20k sales. Going off this logic, if BABY doing sales by 2023 of 1.5 billion then applying the multiple means it could sell for 7.5 Billion.

You might think this is crazy, why would anyone pay 5x for a business's sales? Well they do it now. MSFT bought ATVI for 68.7 Billion when the 2021 revenues were only 8.8 Billion. That would be a multiple of 7.8. Berkshire Hathaway just bought Alleghany Corp for 11.6 Billion with sales of  about 1 Billion and that would be a 11x multiple. There are other examples but just know 5x is cheap for a big well known name with an established infrastructure and customer base like Bed Bath and Beyond.

To tie this all together, here is the current value of the company. The great news is that you don't need to bother looking up the share count on unreliable websites and estimates from yahoo finance that differ from market watch that are different from etrade. Here it is from the company itself on their earnings call today:

https://preview.redd.it/j5gsso9gxet81.png?width=1027&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ab2abb71e719b7ff37221c2400dd7504a13f6ec6

So we KNOW there are only 80 million shares out there. 80 million \* 17.76 (todays close) = 1.420.8 Billion. Funny how the total equals 1.420 just saying when 04/20 is a week away haha.

BUT if we valued BBBY just on BABY alone, the company would be worth 7.5 billion/80 million shares = 93.75. I have seen a TON of speculation as to why Ryan bought calls that exercise as high as $80/share. Well this gets interesting but its quite clear that if Ryan is right about value and they find a buyer, the share price here is going to over 90 which puts all these calls in the money:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/az9azeclyet81.png?width=1507&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=03b869651da0fe6ecb34013dd9aa935192d1b964

I did the math so your smooth brain does not have to. The total amount of options he purchased were 16,701 option contracts with a cost average of 1,785,257. NOTE these expire in Jan of 2023. Ryan does not give a dam about the actual value of these contracts at all. These contracts exist for exercise purposes only and are not going to be sold.

Ryan has 9.4 million shares right now in BBBY and this represents 9.8% of the outstanding shares according to the letter written back on March 6th. Links under the pictures:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/s.wsj.net\/public\/resources\/documents\/bbbletter030622.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/2pbqvoukzet81.png?width=1216&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3c56733372a5d7a8bc5dac781f5578bb7715a088)

On pure coincidence this is a very similar level to the GME letter that was sent back in Nov of 2020:

&amp;#x200B;

[https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1326380\/000101359420000821\/rc13da3-111620.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/ad4xi7drzet81.png?width=978&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=783dce3f7c4ab0699498b6613d75ba2a8502c3f4)

As we all know Ryan actually increased his share count recently and back in Dec 15th of 2020 after he already made the 9% stake in GME.

Now for proof BBBY is listening to Cohen. This part of the letter calls for BBBY to stop commenting on certain things:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/e8hd2loj1ft81.png?width=1071&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ca696b6eaaac14983e75b5ca2b85fb9dfd40b872

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a5r6thnr1ft81.png?width=1061&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=eb2b28ee2fbcdae540893646da981156ae37b826

Its obvious that Cohen does not want BBBY to give anything away ever again. Here is the proof from the transcript of this earnings call today:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sdysz0v22ft81.png?width=1019&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b6837338c5393873c61a14f92650900b00675488

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yimz24bb2ft81.png?width=1035&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2bc69e0d0a6e77bae8bc2acdef890f427b0f2f1f

So its quite obvious that the board and the CEO are 1000% on board with Cohen here on the plans for the future. This being the case, then there is an extremely strong possibility that BABY gets sold and for a very hefty premium at that around 7.5 billion or higher.

If Ryan is Ryan here, he will be buying even more BBBY in the future. Considering the spacing of a purchase in August of GME and then a purchase in Dec even after GME moved up over 100% from what he bought it at, this could mean Ryan will buy BBBY even if it moves to the upside here probably in the next 3-4 months. But I would not even be shocked if he made the purchase even sooner than this.

What moves stocks? NEWS. If you have been in this game for more than 1 day, you know NEWS is everything. NEWS will move your stock up 20% or down 20%. The market dgaf about anything except for NEWS. Theres an entire NEWS channel dedicated to the stock market, tickers are over tv programs that have nothing to do with stocks. Pure news will drive everything.

When the market gets wind there might be a negotiation for BABY or a component of BBBY, this will move the stock, and its going to move hard. The market will have to acknowledge BBBY has an asset generating sales at 1.5 billion with a forward multiple of at least 5x. This company being worth 1.4 Billion is an absolute Joke. Their total liquidity from the earnings call IS their market cap!!

There are endless good news cycles ahead. Insider buying, share re purchase program, Ryan buying even more, BABY being sold. Even when the stock gets over 90, Ryan can literally just exercise his options and gain another 1.7 million shares giving him even more ownership.

For what it is worth, here is the major ownership levels if you care to dig further into who owns what:

DH and I were sitting right there, and I know she was trying to guilt us into letting her babysit our toddler a few days a week (I dont need a babysitter, especially not if its going to create more work for me to bring her there).

Anyway, she goes on and onnnn, asking the friend how often he sees his grandbaby. He said every 3 months, as his daughter and granddaughter live in another state. 
Then MIL fired back, yeahhhh but didnt you get to babysit the baaaaaaby when they went to Hawaii???
He said, no, they stayed with the other grandparents. Daughters husbands mom is a pediatric nurse and his dad is a surgeon. Who would trust your baby with more? He chuckled.

the first night w them was cool, up until her son started to get too comfortable. he would wake up at 6 in the morning and just yell and scream and stomp around for hours while my mom and i were still sleep. his mother would not discipline him in any kind of way. i mean she literally does not tell him to stop or anything, she just sits and watches him do all this stuff all day and never says a word. we would wake up and go to bed with the same thing everyday. weve even noticed how the child would literally beat and throw everything at his mother, and she wouldnt tell him to stop. it honestly seems like shes letting her 3 year old run her life. 

i started to get extremely annoyed, especially after i found out that he had scattered all the jewelry i had throughout my room. but what really pissed me off was that the night before that, i had 2 expensive Stranger Things christmas tree ornaments and found them both with the head missing. ive also seen and heard him throw around my xbox controllers all over the floor (and has possibly stepped all over my xbox itself). i even found my 400 dollar nintendo switch lite on the kitchen floor when i knew i hid it and havent used it in weeks. he also spilled a whole bottle of 70 dollar perfume i had (thats also pretty much discontinued, so its extremely hard to find today.) his mother watched him play and break all this expensive shit and did NOTHING. not even apologized. my mother and i talked to his mom about how she gotta control her kid, but it seemed like she didnt give a shit. 

however this morning, i got extremely fed up with this child and his screaming while i was tryna sleep and yelled extremely loud at him to shut the fuck up and he did. it was the quietest hes been in the last 7 days he stayed with us.

however im guessing his mother didnt like me yelling at him and shortly packed her bags and left with her kid, without saying bye. just a brief im leaving and walked out the door. were guessing she went to the shelter or something, but we honestly dont care. were just happy to have our home back. we havent got a call or text from them since it happened either, so its obvious that made her upset. but it truly pisses me off that shes letting her child touch and play w expensive shit of mine when shes literally homeless rn. like be so fr

but i have to know, am i the asshole or is his mother (my aunt) the asshole?

EDIT 2: the night prior to my aunt and her kid staying w us, she stayed one night at her baby daddys apartment, but got kicked out bc 3 neighbors (one downstairs and 2 across) complained throughout the night of the child being too loud and stomping/screaming all day and night, and called us asking if she could stay w us a few nights. you may do what you want w this extra info.

EDIT 3: for those saying u doubled the price of the nintendo switch lite i did not. wherever my mom got it from at the time, it was about $360 (bc it was around christmas time and the year of the pandemic) plus a extra 20-ish for insurance. i simply rounded the price up to 400. thank you

EDIT 4: i DID NOT yell at the child in front of his face, i had yelled it from my room while i was tryna sleep and he was in front of my closed room door. and for those saying toddlers are gonna be hyper and act crazy, ur the asshole, trust me, i know. ive been babysitting 1-5 year olds since i was 9 years old. ive even had kids spend nights (sometimes weekends) at my house and not a single child has acted the way this child has acted. i would NEVER talk bout ppls kids, but this child is a actual terrorist. 

and if u say YTA for yelling at the child and not the parent i somewhat agree, but its hard to think of that when youre being sleep deprived (from a child that isnt even yours) and only getting 3-5 hour naps throughout the night and still have have to do school and work as a teenager. plus i have mentioned that my mom and I had a talk about this with her, but she completely ignored us.","AmItheAsshole",1466,1466,0,0.94,0,0,0,322

For anyone new to the sub, and because I haven't updated the Doe cases since October last year, he's every Jane/John Doe who has been identified since early/mid 2020, when Covid first hit. These will take you right up to today (25th July).

I've been having problems with my opinion on my father (and my mother by association) and I honestly don't know if I am justified, or if I am being stuck up. I want to highlight my life to this point, one to vent to strangers online, and two to really explain my situation.

My father and my mother were extremely poor as I was growing up. I had a very happy childhood and I never went without. Sure there were things I wanted, but I understood that my parents had no money so I never gave things like vacations or toys much thought. I was raised to believe that family was everything, and because of this my sister and myself were raised alongside my 5 cousins. I was the only boy out of all the families children, so my dad and my uncle were very big influences in my life when it came to a male father figure. When I reached middle school my father landed an extremely good job. It paid a lot of money, but he was no longer at home. He would travel for months at a time, only to come home for a week then leave again. This caused no friction or relationship problems with him or my mother, they stayed loyal to each other over the many years he worked there. I also had no problems, my sister and I would speak to him on the phone every night, and later when Skype became a thing we would video chat sometimes. This is where - in hindsight - that the problems really began.Even though my family was close, I was always a sort of outcast, or black sheep if you will. I showed signs of better than average intelligence as a child, and while I've always been meek and soft spoken I often felt smarter than those around me. I know thats a really egotistical thing to say about myself, and I no longer feel like that as an adult. As a child however, I found myself questioning things that other children (especially where I live) don't really think about. We didn't have a computer until my father got that new job, so when I begun surfing online I finally started finding other people like me, and seeing worlds that I had never experienced before. That made me horrifically aware of how poor and redneck my family was. I questioned that even while my dad was now making more money, why the hell are we still so poor? I was going through an angsty phase of wanting materialistic things, and of course the other kids when I got to 8th grade begun making fun of my clothes that were always from goodwill and wal-mart. I put together a well researched budget with excel and presented it to my parents when my father was home, and it did not go well. My parents both screamed and yelled at me about minding my own business, that I was just a kid and I didn't understand how money works. They said that it was insulting to them, and that I was ""raised better than that"" for trying to help them. In their mind (which is partially true) I just wanted money for myself. After a grounding, many tears and apologies I begged for their forgiveness. They explained that they are doing the best that they can to provide for me and my sister, and for a while I accepted this as truth. It was only a bit afterwards that I began to notice things being... off. First was when tax returns came, my dad pursed his dream and bought a motorcycle, then some time later they bought a new car. This struck me as super odd and it stayed in the back of my mind for a while. It was super exciting as a child, especially for me, to get these new things, but it kind of made me feel uneasy.

Fast forward, I really dove into the internet as an escape. I joined some forums and stuff for my interests and started making friends and acquaintances. It was around this time that I started getting into music, and really wanted to go to my first concert. In a nearby bigger town there was some emo band that I really wanted to see and tickets were 25$. When I asked my parents of course the answer was they can't afford it, and of course I was angry. I was ranting with some forum friends online as well as some of my IRL friends through myspace and one of my good friends Dave told me that if I would help him with his youtube channel that he was trying to start that he would give me an old bass guitar that I could sell. This was obviously a very long time ago and details are fuzzy but I ended up selling it on craigslist to a fellow for 100$. That was a lot of money to me, and I was amping myself up to ask a girl to go to the concert with me when I got the tickets. I remember my father driving and meeting with the man himself with me in the car to sell the bass. I was so happy and excited driving back, constantly talking about the band to my dad. I never noticed that he had put the money in his wallet. When Friday came I came home from school and asked my dad if we could go buy the tickets and he solemnly told me that he and my mother needed to use the money, that maybe when they tour again I could go next time. This absolutely shattered my world. I felt so betrayed and robbed, and when I told the girl that we can't go she started being very toxic towards me. I don't remember much of what she said, but one thing stuck out to me, she told me ""You stink really bad anyway"". That bothered me for a very long time, and honestly it still does to this day. I was always a germaphobe so I kept really clean, the ""stink"" was all because of my parents.

They chainsmoked indoors constantly. They did it in the house, in the car, everywhere. I became hyperaware of the smell and the consistency after this event, and I began blaming them for me being bullied so bad in school. I was talking to forum friends again after all of this had died down, and they told me that my dads theft of my money was very alarming. That even with just smoking that it doesn't make sense that my parents have no savings. They suggested that I investigate them, that I should snoop around because it sounds like they were doing drugs. I had never been exposed to anything like that before, and I thought it sounded insane because my parents were christians and never even drank let alone doing drugs. I did snoop though, and in my dads broken down truck I ended up finding a jar that had been painted black. I opened it up and it smelled horrible, and I didn't really know what I was looking at for a moment until I realized that it was marijuana. Nowadays that doesn't really bother me, but as a kid in the DARE time period I was absolutely devastated. For weeks I couldn't look my dad in the eyes, and I was incredibly anxious around him as well as mad because I blamed him using my money on drugs. Something happened and I ended up telling my mom through tears what I found and she began laughing and sat down with me and my dad to explain that it was just my dads and it really wasn't bad. That made me feel better, but I still had a mistrust eating away at me. It was the summer after school that a real change became apparent.

Me and my sister were arguing about something petty like taking the last soda, and we went to annoy my mom about it. I still clear as day remember my mom spinning around and screaming in our faces ""YOU TWO BRATS ARE DRIVING ME FUCKING CRAZY, GO TO YOUR ROOMS"". My mom had never used a curse word, let alone that one. Me and my sister were so shocked that whatever our argument was was quickly forgotten, and I spent the rest of my night consoling my sister as she cried in my arms. Something was really really wrong here. Things afterwards slightly went back to normal, but my mom was always in a horrible mood no matter what was happening. She was always angry and quick to snap at us, which caused me to really descend into computers and editing. The internet was my escape, and I felt at home there around people I liked with interests that I was learning and understood. My grades were always good, but they really went up in high school. I found my confidence and began taking advanced classes on my own, as well as tech classes and I became a whiz in things computer related. I believe it was 10th grade when I discovered that my parents were both buying and addicted to Vicodin. I don't remember how I found out or what happened, but my mom claimed to have fibromialga and that it helped with her pain. I was incredibly jaded at that point, and it's been more in recent years that I realized really how badly that destroyed my families finances and integrity.

We lived in a trailer, my dad owned the land, and it always bothered me that if they had saved money they could have built a house, or financed a better trailer to be put there. It was whenever they started taking those pills that they just stopped caring about anything they owned. The car they bought kept tearing up and needing repairs, and my dad always refused a mechanic, and would do it himself which led to my mom finding rides with family to go the grocery store when my dad was on a trip almost constantly. It always seemed like when my dad did finally get home, bills were paid then they were broke. It eventually came to a point where my mom would collect half of his checks from his job during a trip to be able to afford to live. You might be asking why would they do that? Why go and collect money? Well readers, this is the point that I realized I wasn't just smarter that people around me, my parents were just completely stupid. They didn't believe in bank accounts. You read that right, they had a mistrust of placing money somewhere they weren't able to collect it, so no direct deposit, no savings accounts, no secure way to handle their money. They had no credit, in fact my moms credit was horrid because way before I was born she got a tech degree in some field that she never worked in. My mom never worked a day in her life to that point. She had a degree, but never used it. So that meant, she didn't pay off her student loans. To this day I shudder to think how much money this woman owes. So no credit, no bank, and a pill addiction. Things weren't looking so good for them, and they began to realize it. They had a break down of sorts, I'm sure it was because they couldn't buy their pills at all. They started cutting money anywhere they could. Insurance was the first thing to go. It was health, car, and home. They stopped paying certain bills consistently. This caused me horrible pain because internet was one of those things. After an entire summer of ramen and sorrow my dad discovered a ""miracle drug"" on one of his trips with a gas station powder called Kratom. Now I don't really know what Kratom is, my parents are obsessed with it, I never really looked far into it because at that point I had stopped caring. In its defense they did kick the addiction to Vicodin fully, but they replaced one vice with another. While Kratom was MUCH less expensive (I assume) they started saving money again and getting back to a good place. They started hand rolling their cigarettes to save money as well, so life kind of balanced back out for a time there.

I had a very pleasant senior year, got a girlfriend, and finished with great grades and even managed to get some scholarships. I was ready to go to school but my parents convinced me to wait and decide what I want to do with my life. My mother was insistent that college was a scam and that I should just stay home, or go somewhere local. Thing is though, their car was still in shambles. I had yet to get my drivers license, and there was no way their car would pass inspection to even take the driving test. I reluctantly agreed, and spent the summer playing games on my computer, watching my friends begin their lives, and growing depressed. Staying home for that year would have consequences in my life that I still have a hard time deciding if it was a blessing or a curse.My dads boss offered me a job doing the same type of work my dad does. Of course I accepted it, and I even got to work with my dad. For the sum of 4 months I worked around America with my father, and I was extremely happy with the money I was making. I became closer to my dad, we had many late night talks, and I started to really appreciate all the things my dad had done as I was growing up. I would think back to how silly and selfish I was when I was an angsty teen, and how now things didnt seem as bad or dire as they did at the time. I now know that to be wrong. On the bright side however, all that time out of my backwoods town exploring the world gave me a whole new perspective on life and my future. I listened to lots of podcasts, learning about industries and the economy and it brought me to the decision that I really did want to go to college. To my parents disapproval I opened a bank account and started saving money, I ended up saving quite a lot in anticipation to get myself a car. I did splurge with my first paycheck of course, and bought myself a new iphone 4 or 5, and I was so happy because I earned that. It gave me a taste of what I could accomplish if I was just smart with my money. Thats when I lost the job.It came as a blindside, and I was told that it was just temporary from management. I didn't have enough money yet to get a good car, so I decided to take a portion of the money I had saved, and I repaired the family car and got my license. I started applying to other jobs around my area while still getting ready for school, and I continued to play computer games with friends.

I was up late one night and stepped away to use the bathroom, to which I opened the door and was met with a face full of black smoke. The trailer was on fire, and my door had shut out all of the smoke. The smoke detectors had never went off, later I found out it was because my mom and taken the batteries out when I was still a kid because their chain smoking set them off constantly. In an ironic sort of twist, I loved steam punk and goth core so I had bought some surplus army gas masks. Even though it probably didnt do much, I threw the one that was on my bedframe on so that I could see and I rushed to my sisters room. She was asleep and so was my mother, acting fast I ripped them both out of bed, throwing a wet towel over their heads and got them out of the door, grabbing my two cats on the way. My mom called 911 while I threw the cats in the car so they were safe. We didn't go back inside because it wasn't safe, but at the same time we couldn't see any flames. Just smoke. After all of it, the firefighters found out that there was an electrical line under the trailer that pests chewed through, and it caught the insulation on fire and basically had an entire inferno underneath the trailer. The smoke came through the vents in the house, but because the trailer was manufactured in the 80s it had a large metal plate separating the house and the underneath. It was only because of that plate that the house didn't burn down. If I had went to school after graduating, or if I didn't lose that job, I wouldn't have been there and my mom and my sister along with my cats likely would have suffocated in their sleep.This is where my personal life became very lucky, while my dad, my mom, and my sister all seemed to have constant bad luck. They moved in with my Aunt Jess temporarily, while I moved in with my girlfriend. My best friend Mace hung out with me one day and took me to eat and to buy some new clothes, his treat. He then took me aside and explained that Ive always been a good friend to him, and that he wanted to help me. He told me that his grandfather had left him a very hefty inheritance and that he wanted me to go to college with him. He gave me a check for 1000$ for books, and he told me he contacted the college. It was a few days later that the university I was interested in wanted to offer me a 4 year grant that was specifically for students who had went through a disaster. I was floored. Ive never had someone put that kind of trust in me, and while Mace and I dont always get along hes still the best friend I could ever have, and I was honored to be the best man at his wedding. Mace doesnt want anything to do with my family though.

Once again in hindsight I was being gaslit, but my parents convinced me to give them the 1000$ as a down payment for renting a new house. This got them a new place to live, but during that time my dad was unlawfully fired from his job.I BEGGED him to find a lawyer, but his response to anything involving police or the legal system is that ACAB, and that no judge would ever help him. So he just wouldnt try.It was this point that I realized that they will never listen to me, no matter what I do. I decided screw it, they can do what they like. I went on to school and during the semester my dad sold the 2 acres of land that he owned to have money while he looked for a job. He sold that land for 3,000$. He never attempted to get it appraised. Some guy out there built a beautiful house on the land, and got it for a steal.So he gets a new job, does really well, and things look like they are going up. My parents actually gift me 100$ every month for food at school. I was working of course, but that was something unexpected. I would come home in the summer, work jobs that I somehow easily found and save my money. I never once owed money for books during my time in college, and I actually ended up buying my first car. It was from a local near my college, an old jeep that was very taken care of. The man who sold it was very prideful of his vehicles, and he ended up getting along with me pretty well.  It was honestly really cool, we talked about what I studied and did for school/hobbies/work and he sold me the Jeep for almost 65% less than his original ask if I would photograph his daughters wedding. I tell you this because it was my car. I was so happy because it was special, I earned it on my own merits and I was proud. That summer when I returned home my parents car gave out. During that time I was so focused on my car I didnt really think about them no longer sending me money because I never needed or asked for it, let alone expect it. They had once again traded one vice for another, while kratom was still present, they now were eating steaks and burgers almost every night. It was like an easy 300$ a week on groceries for them and my sister. This led to them borrowing my car, and while I was very hesitant I let them because they needed it to be able to get to work. I had a ride to my summer jobs easily so I didnt really mind. When it came time for school, I asked if they had saved enough to fix their car, and they both just gave me a look. That look that told me, Im not getting my car back.

They dropped me off at my college for my 3rd semester and I felt defeated. My college friends were super sympathetic and my god. I dont know how I got such good friends over the years. Despite the bad stuff going on at home, when I was at school I was flourishing. I finished off my year, and right when it was getting time to leave my parents were kicked out of that house. Turns out they had missed payments. I only learned that later. I was on their side and mad during it all, and once again I begged them to consult a lawyer. This landlord forced them to pay property taxes, and I know thats illegal for a renter in my state. It was the same answer. No one would ever do anything to help me. They move once again to a slummy house this time, but I think the biggest heartbreak when I arrived was my car. It was destroyed. Despite me asking them, they had smoked inside. There were cigarette burn holes in the seats, trash everywhere, spilled coffee that was never cleaned. They absolutely has backed into a pole, and I could tell a headlight was replaced because the metal around it was scratched to hell, I assume they also hit something. They had truly stolen my car. We moved into this shitty house, I got lice for the first time in my life there. Ticks, bugs, the water was lightly brown. It was horrifying to think of all the mold that was growing there. You could smell the septic tank through the sinks, they had to keep them constantly plugged. I couldnt stand it, I ended up working that summer and staying with Mace and my girlfriend the whole time.So I go back to school, and Im doing fantastic. I end up getting nominated behind my back for a merit based contest thing and I win a trip to LA for a week with two other students and a professor to go and tour media studios as well as go to a professional conference. I was so overwhelmed with joy.  I called my parents to tell them my achievement and was met with instant hostility. My mother yelled at me over the phone that that was ridiculous and that I had no business spending money because my dad had just lost his job. All my joy was torn away from me, and I was just at a loss. I never got the chance to even tell them that it was all expenses paid. All I was worried about was my parents. Now it fell to my sister to pay their bills. My sister was fresh out of high school, and was being forced to pay their bills. I did go and had a great time of course, it was one of the biggest highlights of my life. If I ever tried to talk about it to them they would ignore me. I graduated Cum Laude, and I won an award from the department I was in, I was so touched and humbled because the award wasnt annual. It was truly special, and my graduation was one of the happiest days of my life. I was actually getting ready to walk across the stage when I heard someone whisper my name, I turned around and it was two of my internet friends I had never met in person before. I was in tears going across that stage. I remember looking out across the stage and I saw my dad. He was asleep in his chair.Afterwards my friends took me out to eat and we went and played some games as a little celebration, all my parents had to say was they were proud but they had to get back home. My dad actually lit up a cigarette in the middle of a crowd at the school, and a custodian told him he couldnt smoke here, to which he got a snotty look on his face and flicked it into some grass. That was a great embarrassment on what should be a parents greatest day.

I go back home and things are bad. The house is getting worse, and you can actually feel how sticky everything is with cigarette tar. During this time period at school my dad had become addicted to sleeping medication. He was actually eating them by the fistful. My old Jeep was now broken down, and my sister got rides to work with her friend. During this time my girlfriends parents kicked her out for reasons I dont need to get into. My parents ended up asking her to help pay rent, which then turned into them expecting her to pay. I was having a bit of a hard time finding a job this time, but I had got a gig editing videos for a YouTube channel that paid enough to allow me to save money, and help out with the costs of my parents. A day came that we paid bills up, and I asked my dad if he had any luck finding a new job or getting interviews. It was like I was talking to a different person. He was so fucked up on sleeping pills that he would literally dip is head down while talking and would shock back awake. There was no way I was funding an addiction this bad, and I refused to ever give them cash. If they needed something I would buy it. This went on for a bit, and then I found out my dad was almost arrested because he was caught shoplifting. I had enough. I had to leave. Me and my girlfriend saved up very frugally, and even though I really didnt want to, I financed a car. I was having interviews, and I accepted a job in a major city 4 hours away. We quickly packed up and moved to an apartment. Things were rocky for a bit when it came to my parents but it forced my mom to finally get a job, and my dad as well.Then the pandemic hit.  My girlfriend and I were fortunate enough to not be horribly effected but my dad was laid off almost instantly. During this time, he was wrongfully arrested for the first time in his entire life, the police had the wrong guy, and he got out of jail in under 12 hours. I insisted he contact a lawyer, but nope. He tried to get unemployment and is still waiting for it to this current day, and he has still yet to find another job. It was far too late for me to help even if I wanted to, but early 2021 they were evicted for not paying rent. Turns out they read that our state wasnt allowed to kick people out if they didnt lay rent because of lockdown, and they ran with it. They didnt pay rent for a year, so of course they were kicked out when that bills time was up. They moved in with my Aunt again.This entire story is what has lead to this moment.

They lived there for a few months, my mom, dad, and my aunt and uncle. My youngest cousin (22) would bring her newborn baby there to get away from her abusive boyfriend. It seemed like it was all going well until last Friday. I woke up to a flood of texts from my pregnant sister. My mom called her and told her to clean out the guest room my sisters fiancé has because she and my dad had to move in with her. My aunt kicked them out and she wouldnt tell my sister why. Turns out my youngest cousin got a bunch of text messages from my dads number. My mom made it seem like it was a bunch of sexts, and they wanted me to defend my dad because he said he was hacked or spoofed. They wanted me to show proof that that could happen. So I asked to see the messages. My aunt had taken pictures of my cousins phone, so I know they werent fake, but also my extended family wouldnt know how to fake messages anyway. My mom was refusing so my sister waited for her to sleep and send them to me. The messages were my dad confessing his love to my cousin. That he had developed a crush on her. It was all very juvenile, like a middle school boy asking out a girl. They tried to say my dad doesnt do stuff like that, and my dad insisted that he was spoofed and someone was trying to mess with him. Hes blaming my cousins abusive boyfriend, but when I read the messages it was exactly how my dad talks. Down to the same particular emojis. It was creepy, but not sexual. But somehow that makes it worse. Its like he wanted my little cousin to run away with him or some shit. I couldnt talk to my dad, and my mom begged me to tell him I love him. The thing is, hes not the man who raised me as a kid anymore. This behavior, and the intrusion of them moving into my sisters home has shaken me to the core. I said something to him along the lines of that I love him, and that he will always be my dad, and he had nothing to respond. My mom said I might as well have told him I dont believe his story and that I stabbed them all in the back.

So readers, will I be the asshole if I just cut contact here? I just dont have the will to continue this charade. I have a lot of money saved now. Im in good standing and my partner and I are in the process of buying a home. I dont ever want them to know. I dont want my parents to be homeless, but at the same time, Ive given them all the help I could in the past. I dont think I can go through with this again. The idea of them showing on my doorstep actually horrifies me. I feel so deeply sorry for my sister, and I am absolutely going to help her financially. I just dont know what to do or say.

This is all so fucked up.

Edit: Before posting I was originally going to post this to AITA, but the post was denied because of a rule about ghosting/cutting contact topics. I would still like to know WIBTA, but I also welcome any questions, advice, or discussion here. As a final thought, My father has no family at all. He was outcasted at a young age. I have never met my grandparents, and my dad has never met his real father. They were abusive to my dad in literally every single way, you name it, they did it. I could talk about my dads past trauma in length. I just don't think its that important to this story at this time. It very well could explain some of his actions however. The reason this is a mess is because my moms family is the only family I've ever known, and by my dad doing this, and my mom ""STICKIN BY HER MAN"" they have made enemies with literally every extended member of my family.

UPDATE: First off I want to say thank you for the support, every comment, constructive, brutally honest, hate filled or otherwise. All of it gave me the courage and clarity for what I needed to do. I started writing this about just the text message stuff, but as I began, I really started venting and I absolutely used this as an outlet for my lifelong issues. To everyone who said that I should have left before, I do agree with you, but back then I was absolutely going through stockholm syndrome. It took me finally moving out to accept that, and unfortunately this last weekend I had to deal with something horrible.

My cat that I have had since all the way back then (mentioned around the fire part of the story), had been looking a little down so I took him to the vet. It turns out that it was worse than I could have imagined. He was dealing with kidney failure, it was very sudden. He had just had a check up last year, and was totally fine. I decided to put him at rest at the vet. I have never been fortunate, or unfortunate enough to deal with something like this. All my past pets died of natural causes/ran away/ old age peacefully. As I held him in my arms and he took his final sleep, I think something broke inside me. I had clarity, if he was still with my parents he would have suffered and died with them shrugging saying they didn't know what to do, they wouldn't have ever taken him to the vet. I called my parents to say goodbye to them, and in the same call I told them that I would no longer be willing to help them with anything from here on out. I haven't spoken to them sense, but I did decide to go low contact just for my sisters sake. My parents will never step foot in my home, and I refuse to ever pay a single thing for them again.  I said many other things that I don't remember in my hysteric state, but it is safe to say that I am free.

Thank you all so much for listening to my story, I don't see myself posting ever again.","entitledparents",1318,1318,0,0.96,5,1,0,147

TL:DR: I said something horrible to my spoiled nephew and my brother's wife after he got lost at the mall, hurt him, and I ruined the relationship with the rest of my family.

My brother(30) and I(26) have been close ever since we were kids, but he knows I'm not available as a babysitter. I hate children, and I never intend to be a mother, but I know there's a difference between not wanting kids and being a jerk. Whenever I have to interact with a child, I still act polite and nice, but there's only so long that I can keep it up. Kind of like customer service. My brother knows this and he respects that boundary, and sometimes I help pay for or drive my nephew to babysitting or drop in day care when he needs it short notice, but that's as far as I go when it comes to child care.

His wife(30) doesn't. She constantly treats me like the evil mother-in-law, which is ironic because she gets along really well with my mother. She acts like my lifestyle is a personal attack against her somehow, and constantly tries to talk down to me, saying things like ""that career of yours won't fill the child-shaped hole in your heart"" and ""you're going to change your mind, but it's already too late for you to find a man and start a family,"" and gets annoyed when I don't rise to the bait. She doesn't say anything when my brother is around, because she knows that he won't tolerate it. He doesn't even accept it when my parents bring it up, but she still calls me out of the blue to ask me to babysit and uses that as an opportunity to talk down to me. She also hates it that I call her ""my brother's wife"" instead of sister-in-law, which I know is petty but she's always been obnoxious to me. But, for the sake of not typing it over and over, I'll just refer to her as Karen for now.

I've told my brother about this a few times, but she still does it, and at this point, I just ignore her most of the time, since she wasn't going to change. I've also told my parents that I don't enjoy being around her, and I'll usually avoid her at family gatherings, even when I'm nice to my nephew, but I don't spend that much time with either of them, and they see that as a point against me. She is the mother of their first grandson, after all, and she and my brother were planning on having more kids before the pandemic hit and they had to tighten their finances. My parents have pressured me before about helping them out during the pandemic, since Karen quit her job to take care of my nephew so my brother could focus on work, but I asked him if he needed help, and he said no, he was still making good enough to not have to worry if they were careful about their money. I didn't think much of that, since we were both raised to be frugal. They own their own home and cars, and don't have to worry about debts, so it really only affected their plans for kids, which my brother was fine with pushing back.

On the other hand, my parents and Karen hated that I didn't give anything to them. I rent a one-bedroom apartment and I make decent money, plus I have a good amount of savings in case of emergencies (again, frugal, I don't like spending money I don't have to.) My parents spoil my nephew because, again, first grandson. They practically paid for the first two years of his life and even helped design his nursery. I gave the obligatory new baby and birthday/holiday gifts, plus occasional gifts for things that I see on sale or an extra snack, but not nearly as much as my parents or even my aunt. They think I'm selfish for not helping out in my brother's time of need, and they hate when I say that he's *not* in a time of need. It's been the main thing straining our relationship these past couple years.

This preferential treatment got into Karen's head. She gets her way all the time in both my family and hers, and I watched her turn from stuck up into a full blown Karen from a distance. She lets my nephew run around freely and do whatever he wants and gets whatever he wants, because she knows she can ask for money from her parents and mine. My brother tries a lot to be a good father and my nephew is definitely better behaved around him, but his line of work means he's often working long or odd hours. The only thing I feel bad for when it comes to staying distant is that I also watched my nephew turn into a spoiled brat.

Until today, that is. As I said earlier, my brother respects that I will never babysit my nephew, no matter the situation. My family wanted to get together for the weekend since it's the holiday, but my brother has to work today, so the plan was that Karen would drive her and her son to my parent's place early, and he would arrive later. I was going separately, and I went to the mall to pick up groceries for the weekend, plus get a few things done before heading over. Neither she nor I were expecting to meet before, but somehow, I ran into her at the mall after I finished an errand at the bank. Apparently, she wanted to check out some sales before going to my parent's place, and she brought her son with her.  I felt uncomfortable just seeing her but she walked over to me and greeted me like we were super close. I knew right then and there that she wanted something. It didn't even take two seconds past basic hellos for her to say ""There's a sale on lingerie that I want to check out and that's no place for a child. Watch &lt;Nephew&gt; for me while I pop my head in, okay? It'll only be fifteen minutes""

No asking, she was just telling me to. Now, the last time I saw my nephew, it was back in January (I didn't go over for Mother's Day because my next door neighbor caught COVID, and I was considered in close contact with her because I brought over some groceries for her) and even then, he was this hyperactive ball of energy that only stopped when my brother told him to but his behavior seemed even worse since then. He was screaming at the top of his lungs about some toy he wanted, and she was just ignoring him while smiling at me.

I said ""no, I'm here to pick up groceries for the weekend, and I don't want to watch him.""

She immediately gave me this nasty look, crossed her arms and said ""It's only for fifteen minutes. You could even take him to the grocery store with you, or better yet, why not take him to buy some toys? You never spend any time with him anyways. Why not get him a gift so he remembers that he even has an aunt?""

I was really annoyed with her, but I did my best to hold my tongue and be polite. I said ""No, I've told you again and again I'm not going to watch him. There's a kid's play area nearby, why don't you just take him over there?""

""I'm not going to let some stranger touch my boy, and that play area is filthy. You're his aunt, why are you neglecting him?""

""Because it's not my job to watch over him. You're his mother, not me.""

""Being a mother is hard work, but you wouldn't know that. I just need fifteen minutes to pick up some new lingerie, why are you being so difficult?""

""You know how I feel about kids, and I don't feel comfortable watching him.""

""Well, that's because you're not a mom. You don't understand just how wonderful children are"" and blah blah blah. We basically just got into it, back and forth.  She had such a stupid, smug smile on her face and I remember rubbing my forehead and just getting more and more annoyed with her, but just trying to hold my tongue. But at some point, I realized something. I didn't hear my nephew's whining anymore. I looked around and he was nowhere to be seen. Karen didn't notice, because she was mid-rant about how hard motherhood is and how rewarding children are.

I cut her off mid sentence with a ""Where's your son?""

""What?""

""I said, where's your f-ing kid?""

""What do you mean? He's right-""

This was probably the only time in our lives that we shared something. We both panicked and started looking around. It was a busy mall and there were all sorts of places he could've ran off. We split off to search everywhere, keeping in touch with our phones. I went to check everywhere nearby, like the toy store, bank, even in the grocery store. I asked information if they'd seen him, but they said no. I don't know how long I spent running around inside the mall. At some point, it occurred to me to check outside, and thank God I did. When I finally found him, he was in the PARKING LOT, jumping around and running. I ran towards him and saw this big truck turning the corner. In hindsight, it wasn't going that fast and I think the driver was just looking for a spot, but my mind only registered a child near a moving car. I ran right at my nephew, grabbed his arm, and pulled him HARD away from truck. The driver called me an idiot and to watch my kid, and I can't blame him.

My nephew started crying, because I pulled his arm hard. There was already a bruise forming and I could tell I scratched him. He was screaming at me, but I looked him over, and asides from what I did, he seemed fine, just dirty from a puddle. I know I should've comforted him somehow, but I didn't know what to say. I wanted to say he was fine, but I was the one who hurt him. I wanted to scold him for running off but he was already crying. I ended up just calling Karen and telling her where we were. She said she'd be right over.

It took five minutes for her to show up. Five minutes of my nephew crying and me not knowing how to comfort him. I checked on his arm, and I could see that my nails cut him, but I didn't have any bandages or anything. I knew Karen kept a first aid kit in her car because my brother bought it for her, so I figured we could just treat him there. When he saw Karen, he immediately rushed over to her, bawling that I had hurt him and how I didn't care. She demanded to know what happened, and I tried to tell her that I yanked him away from a car, but she just kept screaming that ""it's a parking lot, you idiot, you just had to yell stop! you could've ripped his arm off"" and ""just because you hate kids doesn't mean you can hurt one.""

I felt awful about hurting her son, and I nearly listened to her and I started to feel like it was my fault. Until I saw what she had on her arm.

The pink bag from the lingerie store.

While I was panicking and looking around for HER kid, she went shopping. While I was freaking out about my nephew nearly getting hit by a car, she was looking for underwear and I saw red. I snapped and I cut her off, screaming at the two of them that ""The only reason he got lost is because you'd rather talk shit about me than actually pay attention to your stupid, spoiled brat. The only reason he got hurt was because you went shopping instead of finding him. And when he grows up to be as selfish and self-absorbed as you, he'll pull something that'll get him or someone else killed, and neither of you will be able to blame anyone but yourselves."" I felt great at the time but now I just regret it. What I said has been replaying in my head over and over since then.

My nephew just went quiet. He'd completely stopped crying and stared at me like I just killed his dog in front of him. Both of them were horrified, and for a minute, no one said anything. Then, she told me to go eff myself before walking away. It took me some time to calm down, and I started feeling guilty after what I said it, but I didn't want to call her to apologize. Instead, I went back towards the mall and took out my phone to call my brother to tell him what happened but before I could, my phone rang.

It was my mother. Karen called her and told her what happened, and she told me not to bother coming over for the weekend. She couldn't believe that I'd say that to a scared crying child, and she didn't want to see me. She said that my father is already calling my brother, and none of them ever want me anywhere near my nephew again. I was stunned. I freaked out, tried to explain what happened, but she hung up. I called back, but it went straight to voice mail. I tried calling my dad and my brother, but same thing.

That was a few hours ago. I sat down for a bit, trying to put things together, and... I guess that's why I typed all this up. I have no idea if I just lost my whole family because of what I did and said but I don't know. I needed to type this up. Today, I truly fucked up.

**Update:**

Basically, my mother and father did block me, but my brother didn't. Since he was still working, he had a lot of meetings to go through during the day and turned off his personal phone, since he trusted us to have things handled if something went wrong. I didn't think to reach out to his work phone, so I assumed he just didn't want to hear from me. And honestly, re-reading my post after waking up, I think I was spiralling a little, so I am sorry about the rambling in the  beginning of the post.

I heard from him that Karen had told them all that it was my fault her son got lost because I said I'd watch him for a minute and I didn't and when I found him, hit and screamed him for running off, so that made them think that I was abusing a scared lost kid. But my brother caught her in her lie when he found the bag from the underwear store. After some pressing, she finally admitted that I didn't agree to watch him, and that's why we argued, and when she got the call that I found him, she was already beside the store, so she figured she might as well go inside since she knew he was safe. She even started crying and saying that it was an impulse because she was so stressed out and scared that her baby was missing that she just had to go into the store and take a moment for herself.

My brother was furious, and walked away from the conversation to calm down. He said he opened reddit then to try and calm down. At that point, he saw that I sent him the post, and finally got to see my side of the story. He contacted me, told me that he wanted everyone to sit down and talk,  and that he'd be setting up the call. I got the chance to tell my parents what happened, and everyone was upset at Karen, but she insisted that she didn't go shopping *while* her son was missing, but after I called. That was the only part of the story that she could lie about, especially since they know that I wouldn't watch him just so that she could go clothes shopping. My brother didn't believe her, but doesn't want to divorce her for nephew's sake. However, he said he's not sure if he can ever trust her in an emergency again, especially since I was a lot more reliable in the situation than she was.

This is where the weirdest part of the night happened. She broke down into tears and started screaming at me. She says that I stole her husband away from her and that she's the one that they're supposed to believe because she's the mother. Apparently, she doesn't think that there's such a thing as male-female friendships even between *siblings.* She thought that I was in love with my brother and trying to steal him away, and that's why I hated her son. And she was afraid that he'd run off with me because my job was better than hers even when she was working.

I don't know if it was because of how insane she sounded, or just because of everything that happened yesterday, but I just started laughing. I could hear my parents yelling at her, asking her what the hell is wrong with her, but she insisted it was normal for a wife to worry when her husband spends a lot of time with another woman alone. I remember this specifically because my mom screamed at her ""not if they're family, you moron!""

After I finished laughing, my parents apologized for not giving me a chance to explain, and they thanked me for doing the right thing. They said that if I wanted, I could come back for the weekend. I told them that I would think about it, but after everything that happened, I didn't know if I'd want to. They understood, and we hung up.

My brother called me afterwards to talk a bit more. He apologized for his wife and for being out of reach during an emergency, but he also asked me about some of the things I typed in the post, how I focused a lot on how his having a family was stressing me out. He'll have a long talk with our parents, but he thinks that for the time being, it'd be better for me to just avoid the family for a bit and focus on myself. And after reading the post again today, I do agree with him. I think I definitely resent my parents and Karen for trying to make their family my financial burden, and I don't know how I feel about them after yesterday.

And Mo, I'm sorry. I don't hate your son. But your wife is an idiot, and I'll never respect her. And thank you, Reddit, for this support, but I guess this is the wrong subreddit for me to have posted this in. Yesterday, I was in a bit of a mess, and I blamed myself, but now, I know that yesterday, it was her who fucked up.","tifu",1306,1306,0,0.93,8,0,1,337

I get it. Babies and little kids are cute. They really are. 

When I had my boy 4 years ago I was taken aback by how many people, usually elderly ladies, just went ahead and touched the kid. Sometimes grabbing his little foot, which is the least bad. But then also the hands and worst the face. I do not know any of these women. I mean its ok if they look, but I hated it when they touched him. Now I am not exactly confrontational. What I ended up doing was using an insect net when I went to stores or places I knew this to happen. It helped. 

&amp;#x200B;

I learned a thing or two about speaking out and standing up for myself since then. I now also have a daughter who is almost two.   
When she was born it was midst pandemic so the problem wasnt that present. But people seem to have the need to catch up, so it happend twice last month that older people felt the need to touch her. 

One guy was in front of me at the check out of a grocery store. Before he reached her I pulled the buggy back and told him his behaviour lacked respect and it was not ok to touch children of strangers (even if you dont know someone well...) 

Well he was angry, his wife shot daggers at me and two youngish guys behind me snickerd at me. I didnt care, but was proud.

&amp;#x200B;

So next up, I´m at another grocery store, my daughter sits in the trolley. Her grandma pushes her. Out of the blue some lady shows up and grabs my babys cheek. I call over, telling her to take her hands off my daughter. She too, was very pissed. saying she didnt carry the plague. I told her she has obviously missed out two years of pandemic and being tought on basic hygiene. My mother in law was ashamed and told me to be quite. 

I admit my plan is to just touch the next person right in the face to see if they like it. Does this make me the AH?","AmItheAsshole",1295,1295,0,0.96,2,0,0,219

JNMIL is a raging narcissist","I JUST gave birth days ago and mother inlaw has gone past the boundary, dug a whole 100 metres deep and jumped right down to the bottom.

I did it. I gave birth to my beautiful little baby. It was a traumatic birth, to say the least but I am absolutely besotted by my little human. 

Now, Ive written about my MIL in many other groups. So you may recognise my user name. If you dont, my MIL is the one who publicly stated my childs name on Facebook prior to birth and wrote parents optional btw, we only need the mother for the boobs for the first 12 months. Called me an incubator and a milk maker. And also threatening to breast feed my baby if I wont. Theres ALOT more to previous stories but I thought wed begin fresh and clean, with a new book and new chapters. 

Now I had an early gestation but late scheduled induction. It was booked, maybe a week before but I ended up just getting a call to go in. Went in, began the induction process and all was well. We had originally kept the induction a secret to avoid the stress of family members blowing up our phones. 

Hubby was doing great as my support person, and initially during the first stage it was quite painful and I was very anxious. Hubby and I both struggle with anxiety and I could tell he needed someone to speak to other than his stressed out wife. So I suggested he call FIL (whom we love), he did and hubs also let MIL know.

Well MILs response was exactly what I thought it would be. She asked why immediately instead of asking if we were okay. Hubby was a bit frantic so he accidentally mentioned the gestational diabetes. Her response. Killed me. Oh ok, I didnt know she had diabetes but I suspected. 

Im sorry? Suspected? You live in another state and we dont talk. You ASSUMED, because Im overweight that I was diabetic? Lots of fat people arent diabetics, so MIL is either ignorant or just fucking dumb. Ill leave that for you guys to decide. It gets worse from here. 

She then kept sending messages with emphasised capitals about how my hubby needs her more than he knows. She can come whenever he needs her. She is HIS mum, and she will be there when HE needs her. Saying she can be there in 6 hours. All to which he told her she doesnt need to come, we dont want that. She was in Thailand. 

I mean what does this bitch actually think would happen if she came? I JUST gave birth. Were in a PANDEMIC. We are not having her get on an international flight to come and ruin our experience as new parents whilst exposing our baby to diseases. Im the mum, Im teaching hubby what to do with OUR baby. Whats the use of her being here? Where was she when we got married? Where was she the last 3 years of our marriage? NO WHERE. 

She was demanding pictures straight away. When we finally settled in and decided to send one, she immediately said baby looks nothing like hubby. She then said she would get out her own baby photos, like of herself? Now, my baby looks like me. Every single person who was in the hospital told us that. Same with all our friends and family. MIL has completely disregarded me, and acted like I dont exist. Baby looks like me bitch. Because the baby is mine. 

I was perfectly unaware of all of this, this all happened whilst I was haemorrhaging and having a manual removal. Having my second degree tear sutured, and just genuinely trying not to die from losing over a litre of blood. Hubby was pretty hysterical at the situation, so Im not mad with him for speaking to her. He was stressed about me and probably needed someone to talk to whilst the surgeons were doing their thing. My mum was there too so they were taking turns throughout labour and all the rest.

MIL tried to persistently undermine our new parenting choices immediately. Stupid ass BIL Posted a pic of baby on socials, and husband told him off. BIL deleted and apologised. Still not happy about this but letting it go. Anyway hubby explained to MIL there is to be NO pictures on Facebook. She rolled her eyes at my husband, and defended BIL. There was much more of this, and now I just hate her. 

Theres a lot more I can share, so I might have to do a part two tomorrow. Im going to try to catch some sleep while my love bug sleeps.","JUSTNOMIL",1281,1281,0,0.98,0,0,0,118

A few points to consider.","**Who am I?** I am a family physician in a small town in SW Ontario. I practice comprehensive family medicine including outpatient family practice (clinic), inpatient/hospitalist medicine, emergency department, and obstetrics. 

This post was inspired from the recent post on this subreddit ([LINK] (https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/xs3eh2/psa_please_dont_go_to_an_er_if_youre_going_to/)) where a fellow healthcare worker made a post in an attempt to educate the public about how our system is set up. **The reality is, our system has been on life support for years. These past few years in the pandemic have just sped up what has already been happening behind the scenes, but in my opinion was going to happen regardless over the next 5, maybe 10 years. **

It was quite eye opening reading some of the responses from fellow Ontarians and it led me to conclude there is a big discrepancy between how the system is set up and how the average person understands it. People are often upset with how their medical visit went, the wait times for various referrals or services, but do they even understand how the system is set up? How do you even begin to address an issue, come up with solutions that may address it, if you don't even know how it works?

**This post by no means is meant to be exhaustive, but my goal is to simply begin the conversation about how our healthcare system is set up by addressing some common questions that I find my own patients do not know the answer to. The point of this post is not to point fingers, because there are many sides to the issue and multiple parties at fault including some outliers in the medical community who have been abusing the system for their own gain. I say this as a physician myself. The goal of this post is to simply start the discussion about some glaring issues in how the system is set up which I hope allows the average person to talk about this to change perceptions and misconceptions about what is going on with our healthcare system. Since I am a family physician, I am highlighting some of the issues that plague family medicine, and whether people realize it or not, this then impacts the rest of our healthcare system including the emergency department, specialist wait times, wait time for CTs, Ultrasounds, etc**

I apologize in advance if some of the information over-generalized - my goal is to simplify how the system works, and in that endeavor, it can sometimes lead to the information being generally correct, but of course it does not cover the exceptions and nuances that are set up in this incredibly complicated system. 

**What is OHIP and what is covered under it?**

Ontario Health Insurance Plan, or OHIP how it is commonly known, is an insurance system that pays for medical services for the residents of Ontario. OHIP is funded by both the provincial and federal governments. It covers every Ontario resident with a primary address in Ontario.OHIP pays for health care services that it deems medically necessary. Any visits to physicians, investigations (lab tests, procedures, imaging) and procedures or surgeries are billed to OHIP to the government. This process occurs by physicians, hospitals, and 3rd party contractors (think Lifelabs, Dynacare, various imaging facilties) using the patient's health card to send a ""bill"" to OHIP.

Services not covered by OHIP:

* __Medical Care for not medically necessary purposes__ This includes services done for cosmetic, employment, insurance, travel or because someone wants to have something done (if it is felt to be medically unnecessary). 
+ __Prescription medications or assistive (medical) devices__ There are a few common exceptions for this. Any medications in a hospital setting is covered. Seniors over the age of 65 are covered by the Ontario Drug Benefit (ODB). OHIP+ covers prescription drugs for individuals under the age of 25. Individuals who are a part of the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) also have their prescription medications. Not all prescription medications covered by these services, and there are rules and certain requirements to have certain medications covered. See the [ODB formulary] (https://www.formulary.health.gov.on.ca/formulary/) for a better idea of what is and isn't covered. There is also financial aid for prescription medication coverage to ALL Ontarians via the Trillium Drug Program - the amount of assistance depends on your income claimed on your taxes each year. 
- __Physiotherapy__ is generally not covered except in a few specific circumstances. Unfortunately the amount of coverage is limited, or the wait list for clinics provided OHIP covered physiotherapy is silly long.
* __Vision care__ Annual eye exams are only covered for individuals who are under the age of 19, over the age of 65 or if they have a specific medical condition (such as diabetes, etc) at any age. 
+ __Dental Care__ Generally not covered outside of a hospital setting. Few exceptions for this as well, too many to list, but generally for the average person, not covered. 
- __Allied Health Services__ Allied health services are generally not covered by OHIP. Allied health include Optometrists, Dietitians, Physiotherapists, Occupational Therapists, Psychotherapists, etc

**Why does my doctor charge for certain things?**

*__Non-insured services__ As above, there a number of things that OHIP does not pay for. Physicians in Ontario are able to charge what they wish for non-insured services. The Ontario Medical Association (OMA) have a suggested fee guide for this, but ultimately a physician can charge whatever they wish (within reason, but not defined by our colleges and organizations) for non-insured services. This is why there is often a range of costs that differ from clinic to clinic for common things like circumcisions, removal of skin lesions for cosmetic purposes, insurance/work place forms, etc. 

* In general, physicians cannot charge or bill for services that are paid for by the provincial insurance plan as per the CANADA HEALTH ACT (CHA). Individual physicians have not tried to circumvent the law outlined in CHA, but many large corporations (MEDCAN, Maple Health, Shouldice Clinics) have been using legal loopholes to do this. Unfortunately, this leads to the misconception that we can charge privately for better access, skipping waitlist, etc. The average physician does not have the legal means (legal costs is primarily the issue) to try to emulate similar processes to try to offset their expenses to try to cover the gaps left by OHIP. 

**How does and much does my doctor get paid to see me?**
This is a complicated question, but I'll address the basic concepts. The majority of all physicians in Ontario are paid under what is called a ""Fee-For-Service (FFS)"" model. The physician provides a service and OHIP has a pre-set amount that they pay the physician for this service. There are a few other funding models such as rostered models for primary practice (FHOs, FHNs and FHGs) and for few hospital based services that are hourly based (think ER doctors) but they also generally work within the Schedule of Benefits (SOB), and their details can be found there. The system is archaic and generally has not changed much since it was first set up in the 1980s. 

* The services funded by OHIP and what physicians get paid for them can be found in the [Schedule of Benefits] (https://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/ohip/sob/physserv/sob_master.pdf). This document is accessible to anyone to see. The fees went up 1% as of April 1, 2022 and the amounts in the SOB linked, do not reflect the updated values. 

* When your doctor sees you for an appointment, does a procedure, surgery or a ""service"" they send their billings to OHIP as per the services codes defined in the schedule of benefits. 

* The system is cumbersome, does not pay you for months for services you have done, rejects billing codes for various system based issues (expired health cards versions, diagnostic code errors, etc). In general most physicians wish it was easier to get paid, and not such a onerous, administrative heavy process that often leads to us just not caring if certain things we bill for does not get paid due to lack of time. Some believe the system is intentionally set up this way to save the government money - I don't know. 

* Common fee codes for walk in clinics or family doctors. The criteria for each of these can be looked at in the SOB. I will simply explain in simple terms (based on my interpretation) when we would bill each of these, again the nuances are more complicated and not worth the time to explain, IMO. 
    1. __A001 for ""minor assessment"" pays $24.25.__ Used when we have a quick follow up for an issue. Common example would be injections or procedures we have already assessed and planned for and now its just the visit for the joint injection or skin biopsy, etc. 
    2. __A007 for ""intermediate assessment"" pays $37.60.__ This is typically what the majority (90%) of visits are billed as. The definition of the code can be seen in the SOB. 
    3. __K005 for ""Primary Mental Health Care for the individual"" pays $69.10.__ Billed at 30 minute blocks of time, appointment duration must be minimum 21 minutes.
    4. __K080 for ""minor assessment virtually"" pays $24.25.__ Phone/video appointments less than 10 minutes.
    5. __K081 for ""intermediate assessment"" pays $37.60.__ Phone/video appointment must be greater than 10 minutes.
    6. __K082 for ""psychotherapy, counselling, etc virtually"" pays $69.10.__ Phone/video appointment greater than 20 minutes.

The fees above are the updated fees with the 1% increase received in April 2022. 

**Why do some clinics or doctors have policies like 1 issue per appointment?**

* If you read the section above, this part will make more sense. Most physicians are billing A007 for the visits. They get paid the same whether they talk about 3 medical issues during the appointment, or if they talk about 1. They get paid the same whether they spend 5 minutes during the appointment or 20 minutes. Even if they spend more than 20 minutes - they cannot necessarily use some of the counselling codes as per the SOB (this is where some of the nuances come in). 

* This is how the system has always worked. In the past, the fees per visit were sufficient to cover the expenses of running the clinic, paying the staff, etc, but with rising costs, and minimal changes to the amount that physicians get paid, many have started to do the bare minimum to satisfy the service requirements set out by OHIP and try to see as many patients as possible to still pay for their overhead (business costs) and still have a reasonable take home. This is the general thing that is occurring with all physicians, whether family doctors, or specialists. 

* Physicians do not get paid for anything they do OUTSIDE of a ""service"". What this means, is any work such as reviewing test results, filling prescriptions, making/sorting through referrals, coordinating care with your other specialists/doctors/allied health is NOT PAID FOR by the government.

* Specialties that rely on running a clinic (outside of the hospital) have to pay for their own reception staff, mortgage/rent for the clinic, utilities, nurses/staff they hire, phone/internet/EMR costs, any equipment they use for injections and/or procedures, cleaning supplies, security of the building/alarm systems, etc. This obviously affects their bottom line. 

**But, don't doctors make a lot of money?**
Now this question is difficult to answer because it is very subjective. I'm going to try to answer this in as unbiased of a way as I can. The reality is, yes doctors make ""enough"" money. However what is enough, is an individual determination based on their life phase, obligations, type of practice they run, etc. Generally, the average physician makes a yearly amount that is in the upper echelons of society but one can also argue that they provide a service that should be adequately compensated. The amount that a physician makes varies considerably based on their practice set up, location of practice, time spent providing clinical care and how they bill the system. I will touch on how they bill the system - the majority of physicians, in my opinion bill as they are supposed to. There are a fair number of outliers that are billing quite high amounts - which may be due to fraud or misuse of the system. 


Over the years, there has been many numbers thrown around on how much specific physicians bill the government. I will simply leave you with the following information. The average physician billed the government $354, 000/year in 2020. The average family physician billed $287,000/year. [SOURCE] (https://www.cihi.ca/en/a-profile-of-physicians-in-canada-2020) Using the family physician example, which I am intimately familiar with, $287,000/year is what the physician gets from the government but from this amount they have to pay for their overhead for running the clinic (staff salaries, equipment costs, clinic building, utilities, etc). The average cost of this is 30% of what they bill the government. This means, after paying for the clinic, the average physician now has $200,900/year. 


Now wait, the physician still has to pay for various other mandatory costs to practice. In Ontario, the family physician needs to pay annual fees to CPSO to maintain their license (~$1700), OMA/CMA/CFPC membership fees (~$3000), malpractice insurance (varies depending on what you do but lets say ~$4000, on the low end). The physician also needs to keep up with their medical knowledge as per the CPSO and must do certified courses, conferences, etc. Lets ball park this to $1500. 


**So what we now have is an average family physician in Ontario taking home ~$190,000/year prior to the personal taxes they must pay like anyone else in Ontario. Since we are talking about averages, the average family physician in Ontario has a practice size that serves 1500 patients.**

Other factors that may be considered into determining how money should one get for being a doctor?:

* __The length of training__ Generally - 4 years of undergraduate degree, 4 years of medical school, and minimum 2 years of residency. This would be a total of 10 years, and this is assuming the shortest residency training program to become a family physician. The reality is the majority of applicants to medical school have done more than 4 years of university level of schooling, including graduate degrees, etc. I remember back in 2015, it took the average applicant 2.6 tries (each try = 1 application cycle, which you can only do once/year) to gain admission to medical school. The majority of residencies one must complete are 5 years in length (this is after graduating medical school). Even with family medicine residency - the College of Family Physicians Canada (CFPC) is extending the training length to 3 years from 2 years. A lot of graduates from the family medicine program, already do an extra year of residency training in areas such as Emergency Medicine, Women's Health and Obstetrical care, Palliative Care, Anesthesiology, Care of the Elderly, etc. 

* __Cost of becoming a physician__ There are many different sources available to google the cost of university fees, etc. There are also unfortunately a large number of costs students have to bear in the current system that are simply there to charge them fees. Medical training is expensive, despite it being subsidized by the government. I will simply point out an obvious, and simple fact that gives you the idea of the typical cost of training and the amount of debt a new physician typically starts off with. In 2010s, banks would give medical students who were admitted to medical school, access to an unsecured LOC for ~$100,000. Today, the major 5 banks give all medical students who are admitted to medical school $350,000 unsecured LOC with a simple admission letter. 

* __Opportunity Costs__ The above few points all lead to this one, final point. A common rule I heard while in medical school, is that the physician will make significantly more that the majority of trades/other careers. However, the majority of those paths can start working in their early 20s, and if they invest/buy property in their early life, it will take the physician till his late 40s or early 50s to catch up to a similar financial standing. It is only after that point, that their higher incomes will allow them to surpass a comparable colleague in another field. Life is unpredictable - physicians, similar to our patients, can also fall ill, have terminal diseases early in life, undergo divorce or other major life changes. Most doctors I know don't go into medicine for the money, and if they do, they are very, very unhappy. 

**I don't have a family doctor, or my family doctor is useless or never available for an appointment. Why aren't there enough family doctors?**

* Complicated question with many factors. Some of the above points should start to help you piece together the many reasons why this is occurring. It doesn't mean its ok, but it is the current reality. I will try to highlight some of the points involved in this issue.

* Physicians are independent contractors, or dependent contracts like many of us joke about our sad reality.  Doctors are not government employees. They are similar to self-employed individuals in that they do not have benefits, need to pay for their own costs of running their business,  and save for retirement (do not get a pension).

* We are independent, but we have to abide by the Health Canada Act - cannot set our own fees and charges for insured services. We rely on OHIP paying us what they determine (and we negotiate, but realistically, we do not have much power, as we cannot strike legally). 

* Essentially we are business owners, where our customer can choose to pay us whatever they want (""Hey, I'm going to give myself a 10% discount because I'm short on money"") while the clinics we run, and the services we provide have fixed, usually increasing costs. We are just expected to take the hit and ""make it work"" by the government.

* Family doctors are poorly supported in the system. This is significant administrative burden put on them by the system, other specialists, how hospitals are set up, etc. Some reasons include:
    1. No centralized electronic medical system. Unfortunately, when technology progressed and electronic medical records (EMRs) started becoming more widely used/available, our provincial government decided in their wisdom that they would allow ""freedom of choice/businesses"" and simply provide a stipend (this no longer exists, was to incentivize early adoption) to hospitals, clinics to adopt an EMRs. Unfortunately, this has left a fragmented landscape where pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, specialists do not know what is being done by anyone else. The nature of family doctors is to act as the ""quarterback"" of the system along with doing primary care for patients which leads to them getting 100s to 1000s of documents/day for their patients that need to be addressed to simply facilitate patient care. Ofcourse since this work is done outside patient visits - it is not paid for by the government and is ""free"". Can you see why some family doctors want to make every single thing an appointment? Have a form to fill? Appointment. Have a medication renewal? Appointment. Want a referral? Appointment. Review some tests that have come back, even if all normal? Appointment. Want to re-send the same referral to another specialist because the first one declined it due to being too full? Appointment. 
    2. This leads to some doctor's schedules being so full of ""unnecessary appointments"" that it leads to long wait times for actual medically necessary appointments.
    3. This is also what leads to some family doctors trying to make their appointments as short as possible often by not providing medical care for things fully in the scope of their expertise/ability. Examples of this would be diabetes care, mental health counselling, pap tests (I was surprised by this one personally by myself), simple procedures such as skin/nail biopsies, cryotherapy for skin conditions, vaccines, well baby visits, pregnancy care, etc. 
    4. The goal of a lot of walk in clinics and family practices is to refer all these things out because they do not simply get paid enough to do all of this.
    5. This leads to long referral wait times, and overloaded specialists. 
    6. Unfortunately, this doesn't just occur in primary care clinics, this occurs in specialist clinics as well. Have you often heard the phrase ""Sorry that is outside my scope, you should talk to/follow up with your family doctor about that"". Specialists also do not want to spend any more time than they have to based on how they are paid by OHIP. They require multiple referrals even though they are following the same issue and saw the patient only a few months ago. They do this because they get paid a certain amount for a ""consult"" which requires the primary care doctor to refer, but get paid a significantly less amount for a ""follow up visit"". So they want a referral for everything. Oh the patient is bleeding in their urine and they have a large prostate? Two separate referrals please, says the urologist with separate appointments. 
    7. This leads to more administrative burden on family doctors furthering the vicious cycle. 
    8. Referring is easy right? Wrong. With the current system, there is no centralized referral system. Each specialist who rejects a referral, now requires admin time to find a new specialist, and refer the patient. Every time a patient requests referral to another specialist because the wait time is too long, same process applies. Then on top of that, you will have various specialist groups or hospital groups who have their each unique form or referral requisition that they want the primary care doctor to fill out or the referral is instant rejected with a fax sent back to the referring office. So now the doctor needs to do some of the admin work for these specialists to organize the information for them in a way that makes it easy for them. Again unpaid labour/time by the primary care physician. 

So what some of the above leads to, is either the family doctor either hire more staff to deal with the administrative burden of ""being a family doctor"" or spend more time doing unpaid work.  This then naturally leads to the majority of family doctors getting fed up and closing their practices, and for new graduates - not bind themselves to patients that they have to continue to provide care for long term. They instead choose to do niche focus practices (only sports med, derm, allergy) which require referrals and operate in a similar way to specialists or work at the hospital full time, do emergency department, and/or walk in clinics only. **This is one of the major reasons for the lack of family doctors**

Strategies employed by many doctors to cope with all of the above that worsens the systems problem:

* Many doctors are over-rostering patients. What this means is that they are signing up too many patients to get paid more to offset some of the issues above I identified. This leads to poor access to timely appointments. 

* Many doctors are burnout and providing less days/week of appointments.

* As previously noted, 1 issue per appointment, appointment for everything, refer out everything they can. 

**My doctor said they will fire me if I use other clinics for my care. Why is this?**

* As discussed previously, some doctors are paid by different models. Family doctors can be part of a model where they get paid per/patient they have, regardless of if that patient comes for appointments or utilizes other services by the doctor or not.

* Some doctors over-roster patients, sometimes due to a sense of obligation - if the rural town/city they are in doesn't have enough doctors, and sometimes due to trying to compensate for the systems issues of not being paid enough. 

* When patients of doctors go to other primary care doctors (walk in clinics, virtual health clinics, other family doctors' offices), that doctor gets penalized by OHIP. Essentially, the doctor has to pay for visits with the other doctor for their rostered patients. This cost comes out of what they get paid for the patient. 

* Patients accessing these other clinics for medically necessary things due to their own doctor not providing timely care - totally fair and valid reason IMO and that's on the doctor rostering too many patients for the numbers of hours they are working or can work. If the doctor does not have a method to address time sensitive appointments (generally reasonable to wait 3-4 days for issues that can be dealt with in a family doctor's office), then them threatening to fire you as a patient should be reported to the college, IMO. 

* However, the other aspect to this is, many doctors to have access to same day spots, after hour clinics, etc and if the patient is choosing that the time is not convenient for them, or they don't want to drive to the clinic, etc, then this is on the patient and a very valid reason for the doctor to fire you from the practice. 

* This is how the system is set up, and based on how it is set up, is what leads me to say what is a valid vs not valid issue - its purely my opinion. Patients can often cost the doctor more money than OHIP pays the doctor for having that patient as a patient and this makes no sense to me and is another flaw of the system. 

**Bottom Line**

The government has been asking for years for all healthcare providers (not just physicians, whose perspective I tried to provide you with the above) to do things out of the goodness of our heart in the name of ""not enough funding or budget for things"". Examples of this are not limited to, but include, nurses staying overtime because floor/nursing home is short-staffed, pharmacies dispensing medications at below cost for pts on ODB, respiratory therapists covering multiple wards/floors of acutely sick patients, different doctors being on call for various services without compensation, etc.  Many of us, went into this field to help Ontarians, have a reasonable/stable career that allows us to not worry about job stability, finances, and to simply do our part in the medical system. The reality for most of us only became apparent once we finished our training, and went out in the real world and we realized, that we cannot just do ""medicine"" and have to grapple with the politics, government policies (that are every changing with different parties coming into power) and often running a business in an everchanging, possibly inflationary environment where our customer (government) can choose to pay us whatever they wish. The government, can even claw back money (and has) they have previously owed or paid physician because their budget is short or tight despite medical services already being provided. I don't know if my other health care colleagues have had similar things happen to them.

The system has been falling apart for years. I believe the majority of healthcare providers have been going above and beyond to fill these gaps and cracks in the system, stretching themselves thin for the ""greater good"" and altruism that the majority of them possess which lead them to careers in the healthcare field in the first place. However, things are coming to a head. We are all burnt out, tired, and done. The few that want to continue to put up with the current system, do so, but I suspect it will not be forever, as they too will reach their limit at some point and choose to quit, retire early and do something else with their skills. 

As the cost of living rises for the majority of Ontarians, many are feeling the pinch. While yes, physicians get paid ""enough"" by many standards, their take home pay has not changed significantly for the last 15-20 years.  I believe the same is true for my fellow health care workers including nurses, PTs, OTs, RTs, and the numerous others I am not mentioning that make the system what it is. WE ARE ALL FEELING THE PINCH. While money is not everything, it does make it easier to put up with the shortcomings of the system that we work in and work for, till we are burnout and tired and can do no more. 

I hope this information was slightly helpful for the majority of you to understand how some basic aspects of the system are set up for doctors. I hope my fellow healthcare workers, advocate for their specific professions and the specific challenges they face, that I know little bits and pieces about, but likely do not know the full extent of it. Goal is not to point fingers at any party, except maybe how the system is set up in its current state. I wish to start some productive discussion with the above information, and clarify any misconceptions and questions people may have. 


Sorry for large wall of text. I will try to respond to things as able and maybe even address other common questions and add them to this post, but this already took way to long (despite how fast I can type :P ).","ontario",1270,1270,0,0.97,25,1,0,282

You can watch it here: 

[My story& (leaving Jehovahs Witnesses)](https://youtu.be/CSMiTak8UzI)


 I did it. 

Long story short, I was a born and raised second generation JW. At age 14 I found the exjw sub and within a day became PIMO.

At age 18 I was disfellowshipped for sex outside of marriage (EDIT: to clarify, I mean ""premarital sex"", I am no cheater!) with no remorse (lol). But that was just a guise for me badly wanting a way out of the org. 

I was homeless for 6 months, then lived with random different girls for another year. After many mental breakdowns, 3 suicide attempts, and development of severe CPTSD - I ended up spending another year back at meetings trying to get reinstated so I could see my family again. I really missed them all, specifically my baby brothers. 

Got reinstated, moved back home, PIMO again. A year later I meet a wonderful worldly girl at work, we wind up getting married after 3 months of dating. 

I become inactive, and begin my fade from the org.

3 years later now, age 24 - I get a surprise call from my Dad (an elder and previous uber JW) saying that he has questions for me as he is now starting to see through the cracks of the org. 

After 6 months of back and forth sharing of information and open discussion - my father, mother, and younger brothers as of yesterday have all put in their letters of disassociation. And I also sent mine in, although Ive been inactive for over 3 years, just to make things official.

My family is freakn free. I never thought this would happen. We used to be that role model JW family that everyone should emulate in the congregation& 

Now they are out. Im one of the lucky ones. I still cant believe it& 

The trigger point that started all this? The pandemic. They said that having meetings via Zoom and having no more field service actually gave them time to think for themselves and see how ridiculous JW teachings are. 

Ive been blessed, and Im over the moon. Just wanted to share this with people whod understand.

This is the story of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Musical, how it was slated for Broadway, and why it took so long for its ultimate revival.

***Diary of a Wimpy Kid***

Let's begin with some backstory. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a series of books by author Jeff Kinney. Jeff Kinney was originally planning to be a newspaper cartoonist, who pitched his comic [Igdoof](https://diary-of-a-wimpy-kid.fandom.com/wiki/Igdoof) to several newspapers. However, all of the newspapers turned down the comic. The most reoccurring complaint about Igdoof was Jeff's artstyle, which many newspapers felt looked ""immature"". During the time when he was trying to get Igdoof picked up, Jeff began doodling in a journal to help himself come up with new comic ideas. It was then when he realized a comic that adapted the journal format could be very interesting. So Jeff created [a series of drafts](https://web.archive.org/web/20221117233648/https://mobile.twitter.com/wimpykid/status/309687721478221826) that he would turn into an online book called Diary of a Wimpy Kid on [his educational website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funbrain). The online uploads were created with hopes to gain reactions on the material. Soon afterwards, Jeff would [go to Comic Con](https://i.postimg.cc/pLMp9LXk/02.png) to find a publisher, and the rest is history. Diary of a Wimpy Kid would become a smash hit with children and adults alike. Its style of humor and relatable situations made it gain a large number of fans rather quickly. One of the most noteworthy things about the success of Diary of a Wimpy Kid is [its cartoon artstyle](https://i.postimg.cc/T3jhnvKx/03.png) used to supplement descriptions of various aspects of Greg's life, which is credited with helping many reluctant readers become avid book lovers.

So naturally, many production companies got wind of Wimpy Kid's success and wanted to make a film adaptation, but ultimately 20th Century Fox got the rights after it [was the first to prove it understood what Wimpy Kid was all about](https://archive.org/details/wimpykidmoviedia0000kinn), and most importantly keep the movie as close to the source material as possible. The film ended up also being a success, and garnered two sequels as well as [a semi-reboot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid%3A_The_Long_Haul_%28film%29) (which was not a success with fans or critics).

----

***The creation***

Now with that all under way, let's introduce another company. [The Children's Theatere Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Theatre_Company) (AKA the CTC) is a company that specializes in high quality children's theater and musical productions, usually adaptations of book material. Some unknown point in the 2010s the CTC gained the rights to adapt the Wimpy Kid franchise. Fox caught wind of this and saw potential to the idea, giving the CTC a larger budget for the production than the CTC usually works with [as well as the added bonus of a potential Broadway run.](https://web.archive.org/web/20220220173924/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/theater/wimpy-or-not-this-kid-might-make-it-to-broadway.html) [The production was also backed by Kevin McCollum](https://web.archive.org/web/20220616235528/https://www.startribune.com/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-gets-on-its-feet-again/600172610/), producer of ""Rent"", so a lot was going to this production to say the least.


The production of the musical seemed somewhat messy, with lyrics and plot changes happening often during its development. The actor who played Rowley, the main character's best friend, stated [in an interview:](https://youtu.be/lEns8zHdbFI)

&gt;Every day you get new pages and you're like ""Oh, I already memorized this song"", but let's just cut it and move on. 

Despite the somewhat messy production, the final release [garnered rave reviews](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OghxSJfO-Az0qHydOU_mHU37E6xrlG_TwbGb25lELcs/edit), and the lyricist [won the Kleban Prize](https://web.archive.org/web/20220529043408/https://playbill.com/article/3-musical-theatre-writers-awarded-100-000-kleban-prize). Many reviewers hoped the mention of a potential Broadway production to be true. [Even Jeff Kinney notably liked the musical.](https://i.postimg.cc/T3jhnvKx/03.png)

***The experience***

Warning: Spoilers for the Diary of a Wimpy Kid book/movie/musical below! If you want to check any of them out, I suggest scrolling past this.

When entering the theater, the audience would have been given [a playbill](https://i.postimg.cc/DfDWTc99/04.jpg) and [a cookie](https://i.postimg.cc/gkZxkZdn/05.jpg) shaped like Greg's (the main character) head. The audience may have immediately noticed the stage when walking in. The set design [mixed elements](https://i.postimg.cc/hPTVZwXy/06.jpg) of the movie and the book, so the actors would resemble the movie characters, but the sets, [props](https://i.postimg.cc/5tn0k55k/07.png),  and projections would resemble Jeff's art on lined paper.  However, the one of the most notable aspects of the set design was the lined paper floor, which [hung and ""flopped"" over](https://i.postimg.cc/9MkfcWnd/08.png) the end of the stage. [It's really impressive honestly.](https://i.postimg.cc/Jz8ZfqJ1/09.png) The stage was also [built slanted](https://i.postimg.cc/HjDs76Hj/10.png) to give an ""off balance"" feel to the experience. 

What is known about the 2016 version of the plot is that it would have followed a similar structure to the first movie, with some book-exclusive plot lines making its way in. Using the outline of the 2022 production's plot, I can kind of guess what the outline of the experience might have been.

Greg would have gone into middle school with hopes that he would ""stand up tall"" and become popular so he can have one place where he would feel special in due to his nuclear family.

&gt;Here's the thing with being me, I'm the middle child of three, having this much family should be against the law. Rodrick is the older one who likes to torture me for fun. Manny is the baby one, so mom and dad say ""aww"". Manny never gets the blame, Rodrick thinks my life's so lame, every year is just the same because I'm stuck in the middle ... my big brother tricks me, my kid brother nicks me, but in middle school I will stand up straight and tall. I'll be right there in the middle of it all. 


Only for those hopes to instantly dash as soon as students discover his ""Diary"", which is really a journal, but Greg's mom bought the wrong book and now Greg has to suffer for it. Greg also discovers the curse of the school, the Cheese Touch, in which whoever touches the moldy cheese on the playground becomes an outcast unless they pass the touch to someone else. Greg, getting sick of not being respected decides to join with his friend Rowley and find ways to gain popularity. The rest follows Greg's misadventures in gaining popularity: joining the local safety patrol, [a rap sequence](https://youtu.be/RY7OulfN5K4) about using his mom's fake currency to trade in and become rich, joining the wrestling squad, competing in an election to become school treasurer, and so on.

A pivotal moment would come when Greg and Rowley go trick or treating and anger a group of teen bullies, which causes them to become chased. The bullies would return to torment the two during Greg's brother, Rodrick's band performance during the talent show, causing Rodrick to declare revenge and Greg to realize that his friend Rowley is ""uncool"". Greg, during his safety patrol gig, chases kindergartners with a worm while borrowing Rowley's jacket and gets mistaken for being Rowley. Instead of telling the truth, Greg ends up pinning the blame on Rowley, which Rodrick finds out by snooping into Greg's journal while Greg was away. Rowley finds out through Rodrick and Greg loses his friendship with Rowley. Greg decides to go to the house of the erratic Fregley, while Rowley spends the night at Chirag's. Greg and Rowley mutually misses each other, but don't have the heart to admit it to each other. Some point, tension between the two builds up, causing a scene at the playground and Greg and Rowley fight. The teens notice, causing all the kids to scream and run, and Rowley is forced to eat the cheese. Greg tells the kids that HE ate the cheese, not Rowley, and the friendship between the two is restored. Things are also getting better at the Heffley household. Rodrick gets punished after Greg's mom discovers a ""suggestive magazine"" in his room, Manny gets punished for stealing one of his father's figurines, and Greg's Dad grows to appreciate Greg's art and allows him to draw posters for the Dad's civil war reenactments. Most importantly to Greg, however, is his friendship with Rowley. Even though Greg is now an outcast for having the Cheese Touch, that doesn't matter to Greg as long as he has his friend. It's a happy ending all around.

**The period after the 2016 Production**

You may have noticed me pointing out a 2016 and 2022 production during the writeup about the experience. There's a reason for this. After the initial 2016 run, the production would be suddenly and inexplicably halted until a return in 2022. With positive reviews and large backing, what could have caused the production to be halted for so long? 

The main reason given by the production team was [the passing of Rachel Rockwell](https://web.archive.org/web/20220616235528/https://www.startribune.com/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-gets-on-its-feet-again/600172610/), the director of the 2016 production. 

&gt;""We had a tremendous loss with Rachel,"" McCollum said. ""We needed time away from it to figure out the next steps.""

There was also the COVID pandemic, the musical was originally slated to return by 2020-2021, but the pandemic caused the plan to return to be delayed. There was also some rumors within fan circles that the Fox buyout that was on going during 2016 put a major halt on any plans relating to the musical. Combined with the negative reviews of the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid film, the Long Haul, possibly placing some reservations with higher ups. Putting the musical and the franchise on hold until things got better for both.

However, things moved forward and the musical reopened again in 2022, with positive reviews and enough people visiting to warrant an extended run. If you know where to look (aka not legal, but easy to find), you can find a recording of it if you want to experience it. I do suggest it as the musical is truly wonderful.

----

***What was changed***

There are a few notable things that changed within the 2022 musical. A majority of the songs were replaced by versions used in [private performances](https://i.postimg.cc/HLpn2vMy/11.jpg) rather than the ones [presented](https://i.postimg.cc/DfDWTc99/04.jpg) in the original 2016 public run. Two scenes that reviewers described as being too long and drawn out: the Halloween scene and the scene between Greg and his mom discussing ""doing the right thing"", were cut down. The mom bucks rap had lyric rewritten and its set radically changed ([2016 set](https://i.postimg.cc/hjvjFJp4/12.jpg) and [2022 set](https://i.postimg.cc/SQX6Cjkp/13.png) for comparisons sake) to fit the reworked Halloween scene. The scene between Greg and his rival Patty where they wrestle in leotards during wrestling class was removed entirely due to many seeing the scene as being awkward. There was also a notable song about Rowley's arm cast that was cut out entirely. The scene with Greg and the kindergartners was changed from being book accurate (Greg chases kindergartners with a worm) to movie accurate (Greg and the kindergartners hide in a ditch after Greg sees the teenagers' truck).  A lot of the sets had been changed, and many, many lyrics were changed or removed entirely.

Two lines in the 2022 production also suggest cut scenes: one verse in the ""Middle of it All"" song suggests a scene in which someone (most likely Rodrick) tells Greg that middle school will ""eat him alive"". Another in the finale in which Greg says he may not be best dancer, or best dressed but he will at least have a best friend. Greg is never shown trying to become best dancer (though this could just be a throwaway joke line, but still notable enough to point out).

---

***The search for the musical***

In summer of 2019, the head mod of r/LodedDiper (at the time), was sent a DM from a Discord friend who had discovered footage from the musical. The footage was a low quality upload of the Mom Bucks rap sequence recorded by a mom on facebook. As silly and weird as the footage was, this inspired the mod to set out a whole search for the musical's contents on the original Loded Diper discord and subreddit. Folks both heavily active and not active at all within the fandom went together and found multiple materials from the 2016 iteration, from advertising materials, to playbills, including one from the test screening! Since then a couple members, including myself, have discovered more footage and materials from the musical, all of which are compiled [here.](https://forums.lostmediawiki.com/thread/9543/diary-winpy-musical-2016-iterations) It's thanks to the group efforts of r/LodedDiper's members in 2019 that this writeup was even possible at all, so I would like to thank them, even if it's for a brief moment of time.


---

***Where now?***

Well, the 2022 production was a large success and the production will hopefully have many performances in the future. With Disney's buyout of Fox, one can hope that Disney could upload a recording of the musical on Disney+ like they did for Hamilton, so all can enjoy the production in a legal manner. There's still a lot from the 2016 production that's still left to discover, and hopefully one day maybe a recording could surface from the original production, even though the likelihood of that is extremely low. 

As for Diary of a Wimpy Kid, the series is still ongoing and successful, with the latest book, [Diper Overlode](https://diary-of-a-wimpy-kid.fandom.com/wiki/Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid:_Diper_%C3%96verl%C3%B6de) having been released on October 25th 2022. It was [stated by Jeff Kinney](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/13/712567191/the-wimpy-kids-best-friend-gets-a-diary-of-his-own-and-he-s-awesome) that the musical was a major point in inspiring him to create a spinoff series: Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid, starring Greg's best friend Rowley. While the first book in the spinoff series had mixed to negative reviews, the rest of the series carried on positively. There's also a new series of animated movies on Disney+, with the latest being a Rodrick Rules reboot that is going to arrive on the platform on December 2nd 2022. Needless to say, Diary of a Wimpy Kid and its adaptations will continue to entertain both young and old alike for the foreseeable future.","HobbyDrama",1240,1240,0,0.95,1,0,0,58

I dont have it in me to do more than that, and there doesnt really seem to be anyone effectively organizing against any of these things. Not that nobody is trying - but nothing is working. And voting clearly isnt enough because the politicians arent fighting hard enough. So yeah, I dont really know what else I can do on top of what Im already doing other than hold my baby tight, try to raise them safely, and protect my sanity. So if you have good organizations to support please post them, but voting is something most of us have already been doing with zero results","beyondthebump",1207,1207,0,0.98,4,0,0,197

My husband was out of them for years after he moved away for college and met me and we stayed close to where we met. About a year ago we moved closer to be near family. The pandemic definitely made us realize we wanted our future kids growing up close to relatives. So we now live an hour from my family and 40 minutes from his. They started including us in the family dinners and we took a few turns, which turned out to be the worst thing ever. Our first time hosting our menu was picked apart, and I was asked why we weren't as generous with the food as others had been. We had plenty but it wasn't expensive cuts of meat and a bunch of expensive sides we served.

The second time I felt terrible and decided to splurge. It was crazy and we didn't serve as much food that time because we couldn't afford it. Nothing was said but we felt it. My husband told his family we struggled for a bit after that week and they were like, that's what you do for family. He disliked it but also didn't want to rock the boat.

The third time we hosted we thought we had found a happy medium. But no. There were negative comments yet again and some of it didn't taste great because most of the ingredients we had never cooked with before and mistakes were made.

The last time we hosted was a short time after I gave birth to our daughter. I had a crying baby who was sick and was functioning with very little sleep, and I wanted to impress my ILs. So I was working on dishes as early as two days before, to slow cook certain elements, and then the day of I spent hours in the kitchen. They didn't complain about the food but they had mentioned I made them uncomfortable acting as though I was ready to pass out and saying we weren't the best hosts.

My husband put his foot down and said no more. I was with him then. We stopped attending dinners and stopped hosting them. They complained, they asked why, they ignored why. Ultimately, my husbands parents asked me directly why we no longer came and I told them. I said we had busted our butts to try and make them happy and nothing was enough so we realized their dinners would never be our thing. ILs took offense to this. Said family dinners should be our thing when we're part of the family.

I have a horrible memory and very emotional rn so I'm sorry if things are confusing.

TLDR: my parents were chill growing up, but then when I tried to establish any independence they gaslit, manipulated, made fun of, and mentally abused me until I cut them off. They don't know I have so this post is just to remind myself what they did for when they come crawling to me sobbing about how good they are as parents and I'm being terrible. 


I wanna say first, I had a difficult childhood but not because of them. I was a happy kid, who had friends and was kinda adjusted. But we were poor, jumped across the US about twice and my siblings and father were all disabled in different ways. (Youngest sibling and dad hard of hearing, younger sister had brain and back injuries due to Chiari Malformation [look it up it's actually a very interesting disease!!])

But when things started really changing was when I was in high school, around my junior year of school. I met a dude and we were best friends then dated. Newsflash, he was a terrible person. It ended in me and my sister getting a restraining order against him and both my siblings seeing and hearing things about me they should never have been exposed to. 


I graduated high school even though I probably shouldn't have with my grades. I'm pretty sure my teachers just pitied me, and then after like a month I got diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression. Go figure, who could have guessed. 

I get on Adderall and it works great. For one day.

Then it devolved into me having all day panic attacks, vivid and extreme hallucinations, massive problems with an eating disorder and an inability to control any emotion. It led to me backhanding my youngest sibling over a dispute involving the dishwasher that I still to this day would do anything to reverse if I could.

I don't remember that three months or so period, I've blocked out most of the memories because they were so mentally and emotionally taxing that just thinking about makes me depressed. But at the time I really thought my parents were doing everything they could to help me through that time. They could've done more, but I reasoned that they were working and didn't have all the time in the world to baby me so I should handle this myself. 

Eventually, all by myself, I decided to go cold turkey and went through withdrawals which were almost as hellish as the actual meds themselves. Looking back now I realized that the only way my parents could've been more hands off were if they had packed their bags and moved out. 

They didn't talk to me about anything, they didn't help me keep track of symptoms. When I attacked my siblings they didn't protect them from me, or me from myself. Now as a 22 year old on new meds, my doctor just within the last month looked at my old records and was appalled because they started me as a 18 year old who was very new to meds and sensitive to them at a dose for grown adults well into their Adderall usage. (She told me they started me off around 25mg when she normally prescribes around 5-10mg for new users)

So they didn't advocate for me at all during this mentally traumatic time immediately after being traumatized for almost a year. 

They took me to a therapist who noticed I was writing a story with an obvious self insert and very influenced storylines from my day to day life. When she asked to see my drawings and everything the next time my mother pulled me from therapy saying something I still remember to this day.

 ""I didn't send you here so she could ask you about your stories. I sent you here so she can talk about how you ex messed you up! She's not doing this fast enough!""

Well, come the end of summer and even though i was still struggling with leaving the house just for a Walmart trip they sent me to school for college across the state and basically wiped their hands clean of me. 

I went into survival mode, believed my parents were right and I needed this so I did my best to fake it till I made it. 

I shouldn't have been there, but in the long run it was what saved me. My friends I met there are some of the people who I've chosen as family and I met my current fiance while there through friends. Funnily enough, I wasn't allowed off campus. Even though my parents lived about two and a half hours away and wouldn't have known otherwise, it took convincing from one of my friends to go about two hours in another direction and it's where I met my fiance. 


My parents REALLY didn't like Connor. But they did like the free labor he did for them and how mature he was to keep me ""in line"" for them. Now they could pawn off the driving around and emotions on him, because they never bothered to teach me how to drive or get a job or regulate my emotions. Connor could do all of that quite well tho, so they let him teach it to me. 

But whenever the idea of him got brought up as my boyfriend, they would clam up. They didn't want me to date anyone, not after my ex. I thought it was them just worrying about me after a traumatic period and I was grateful for it. 

Connor helped us move like five times, he did free things for my parents all the time and he was nothing but respectful the entire time he's known them. But eventually they moved to the same city I was going to college in and I was going through a hard patch again. 


COVID had hit at the end of my freshman year and now they were living here in my college town and I started half online school for my sophomore year. Living with my parents again was hell. I was used to at this point living in a dorm and I wanted to come and go as I pleased. My friends got me rides and I fought and fought and fought to get a job until one day I applied anyways and started working at a McDonald's. 

I was doing terribly in school, I didn't want to be in it anymore. Distance learning was difficult for me and they weren't doing anything to help me. I was slowly becoming suicidal again and I wanted nothing more than to find my own place. 


During this time my dad was constantly working overtime. And one day when I was probably at my lowest he made a joke that he was ""picking up all the overtime just to get away from me"". I still remember it clear as day. 

I was mentally declining and becoming more and more erratic as time passes because I was spiraling again and they just sat by and watched it happened while continuously judging me and making backhanded comments as I did. 


All the way up to this point I was not known for fashion or hygiene. I was constantly self conscious and didn't have control of my ADHD so I was never one to doll myself up. 

But me and Connor were going to go on a date, so I grabbed my prettiest dress, some tights and my favorite flats and did my hair all nice and even tried makeup. I felt so pretty and Connor was showing me with texts filled with compliments as he was on his way to pick me up. 

My mom and siblings got there first, my mom took one look at me and told me to go change. She busted out laughing and was in hysterical over my outfit. She couldn't calm down and the reason she was laughing was because I'm a big chested girl and I had gained weight as of recent because my eating disorder was flipping from anorexia to binge eating. None of my clothes fit me. 

I was in tears and just put on my normal jeans and hoodie in almost 80 degree weather and ran to Connors car in tears. They kept trying to call me back into the house but I just had him drive off without speaking to them. I didn't stay the night at their house for almost two days. 

Mom spent that first night texting me that I was overreacting and that none of the clothes fit me and yes she could've been nicer but honestly I need to be realistic about my fashion if I'm going to attempt it. 

If you couldn't tell at this point, my mom and picked out almost every piece of clothing I owned and because I wasn't anorexic anymore she was very upset whenever I showed skin.


Day to day life was getting worse by the day, but eventually I opened commissions. I posted it on Facebook for family and no one replied but my estranged grandmother on my mom's side asking for an insanely difficult piece. I draw mostly pretty women in specific poses with pens or pencils and that's it. Especially then.

She asked for a landscape drawing of her childhood home in a realistic watercolor drawing that she didn't have any references of and hadnt seen since she was a kid. It was easily worth close to 150 bucks, maybe more because I'm terrible with commission prices.

I offered it for 60 bucks, my mother asked if I was serious. I told her that one, I disliked this woman to the point of purposefully not contacting her for almost a decade at that point. And two, this was so far out of my comfort zone that I would have to learn new skills just to make it. And it's more than half off. 

Then my dad texted me asking if I was serious. It devolved into a pissing contest on who can be colder and how fast I could move out. I wasn't pleasant. I will be the first to admit that, I was mentally unstable and lashing out at everyone. But I was also still a child who was recovering from the toll of drugs I was over proscribed and their emotional indifference during a fucking pandemic. 



I emergency moved in with my fiance, then boyfriend and our friend who introduced us and I didn't speak to them for a week. This is the beginning of their pattern that they pull literally to this day regardless of the situation. 

They finally texted me back after about a week/week and a half and acted as if nothing had happened. They hadn't kicked me out, I hadn't fought with them for days at that point and we hadn't exchanged some of the meanest glances and short phrases of our lives to each other. They wanted to talk about the football game and trivial things in their lives. 

I didn't know what else to do, it was my family and they were giving me the pass to be let back in after I had mentally prepared myself to be shunned forever at this point, of course I took the olive branch. Maybe we'd speak about this in the future and laugh at how stuck up we had been. It could all change for the better maybe. 

Me and my fiance lived there for a year or so before we contemplated moving to the town we had met in and he grew up in. His whole family was there and our current apartment was crawling with drug dealers, people stalking us for his old car and people taking shits in the hallway. 

It was only an idea at that point, nothing concrete. But when I floated the idea to my dad one day when he was driving me home he went on a rant about how I would ""become a baby factory"" for Connor if I moved away from my support system and his family would turn me into their pawn because I was frankly to mentally weak of a person to not be swayed by them. 

He wanted for a long time and dumped a lot of info and at random talked about how he kind of regretted having me and my siblings because he had us so young and he regrets moving across the country like we did because of money problems. I asked him if he just told me that he regrets having us and living in this state and he went ""I did not just say that, don't put words in my mouth"".

I went into my apartment and sobbed for a good few hours. Connor was pissed, but was optimistic because at least he was talking. We both wrote off the bad parts and tried to move forward hoping that this meant that he would be open to talking more often in the future. 


We moved to my fiance's old home, things were fine for awhile. The longer I didn't live next to my family the more I realized that I mentally couldn't handle them anymore. They had been so mean and gaslighting. 

Slowly but surely I was feeding my parents and info diet and I was placing my boundaries. There were a lot of mean spirited comments thrown my way, they used Connor for more labor during this time then keeping him at arms length and refusing to acknowledge that we were serious and looking to move in together. 


Nothing of significance happened for about a year and a half until within the last year. It's 2022 now and me and Connor have lived together for most of the three or so years we've been together. 

We're living in our own home, I'm working two jobs and we're both happy. Stressed, but happy. 

Mom texts in our group chat that she wants me to give up my jobs and move back to their town to become a mailman like my dad. She swears that it's a government job with government pay and benefits and it's the best I can do as ""a college dropout who's working two jobs."" 

I replied back that I was making almost $1,300 a paycheck with both jobs and I just moved into my house and that the town she lived in was absolutely terrible. Remember my old apartment? That's all that's available there and I wasn't keen to move back now that I lived in a three bed HOUSE that's completely quiet and all my own.

She responds by calling me four times in one day, spam texted the group chat and spams my DMs and sending Connor multiple texts and then calling me again. 

I spent two days ignoring her before I finally replied, I answered her calls and she spent almost the entire time during a fifteen minute call that I put on speakerphone for Connor to listen to quietly trying to manipulate me by calling me again a college dropout and telling me I'm not happy there, I'm so far away from family and there's no point in living there. Especially since my jobs were working me to death and they had nowhere the benefits that this mail carrier job has as a government job!! 

I didn't have the heart, or the verbal space, to tell her that the US postal service is in fact not a government entity. It was privately owned. 

I did tell her that all of the benefits I wouldn't need till I was 26. I had all of the supposed benefits from my dad also having the same job. 

She glossed over that and talked over me to try and explain how miserable I was in that town. I told her I had to go and hung up. 



Thanksgiving comes, my entire extended aunt's and uncles on my dad's side come and stay with us. Things are looking good and I'm having fun with my family for once. 

Then I overheard my mom whispering to my uncle that ""my entire personality is just Connor. I don't have any semblance of self anymore and I even moved away to just become Connors girl!"" My uncle didn't react and didn't say anything. But I had to hide away to compose myself because I almost went nuclear and lost my mind. 

Another time skip, now we're in the present and getting closer to the end of our story. 

Connor proposed to me the day before Christmas Eve, surrounded by his incredibly loving family by putting my ring in my stocking and it was beautiful. The first person I called was my best friend, and then the second was my mother. 

It was close to 1am around this time and I got her on the phone, I told her I knew it was late but I was engaged! She told me in no uncertain terms:

""Honey that's amazing, but don't text in the family group chat or anything cause your dad's asleep and he has to get up at 5am. Congrats, I'm going back to bed.""

Neither of them contacted me about my engagement for almost a week until I went back for their Christmas. I went with my best friend and the entire time my family talked down to me, misremembered my size and instead of apologizing they insisted I didn't know my size and that I was indeed and XXL (I'm a medium to large) and started the night off by my mom mentioning my engagement only once. 

It started off with my mom suddenly in the middle of things going good and everyone laughing, she starts cackling and goes ""oh! Your dad and his friend had the funniest thing to say about your engagement!! Dad show her the texts!""

Dad just smiles and he starts giggling to, my siblings laugh along with them. Dad says ""oh, amir just thought it was nuts that you were engaged cause your so young!""

I asked to see the texts, maybe I misunderstood him. They had to be something funny based on their reactions, cause that was very much not funny at all. Especially when I had my best friend sitting right there listening. If anything, that was embarrassing. 

I read the texts and it goes something like:

Friend: dude, she's engaged? That's nuts, she's to young and she's going into this way to quickly

Dad: I know, I'm upset and struggling right now because my kids are all forcing themselves to grow up right now when they aren't ready to and it's hard to stand by and watch them crash and burn like they inevitably will and do nothing about it.

I just smiled, because while they all laughed and giggled about how funny that was, I was struggling to not burst into tears and scream at them. 

My friend pulled me aside and asked multiple times if we should leave, at the time I was using their car. So I told her no. I was going to play nice until I could give it back and then once it was in their hands again I was going to go no contact. 

Connor was supposed to come down and see them and spend Christmas with them but he couldn't face them knowing that this is what they willingly showed us. Especially after Thanksgiving. 


After this I bought a car, my first car that's all mine. And I got their car back to them just last week. I'm putting my life together, I'm learning how to do the beginning of adult things well past when I should've.

I learned to drive, pay bills, budget and spend, and how to exist all from my fiance. I had to forcibly teach myself how to manage my own mental health with the help of my fiance and friends. 

Im done making up excuses as to why I need them in my life. I don't want to deal with the body shaming, the classist behavior, the looking down on Connor for reason. I can't handle it anymore. 

I called my uncle, the one from Thanksgiving, and explained to him my decisions and he immediately told me he supports me and that my parents don't know how to treat us like adults. That I'm not a screwup, and that was the first time in my life that I realized that my parents had conditioned me into thinking I was in fact a screwup. 

So mom or dad, or anyone in the family. If you find this, these are the reasons why I blocked everyone's numbers and deleted messenger. Why me and Connor have our statements and info ready for when you send a welfare check to tell them to leave us alone. 

I'm going to get married and you won't be there. I won't let you. If I have a child, you won't see them. I don't care how much you cry and make me feel like I did something wrong. 

I'm not a bad person for being screwed up, and the things you hold over my head were things I did as a drugged up child. A child you should've protected and should've protected my siblings from. 

Fuck you, and fuck all of your ""attempts"" at communication that you never did but say you have. 

Thank you to anyone who read this, I really just needed to yell. 

When they eventually find out I cut them off, because I made no warning beforehand I was and just dipped after the car was no longer in my hands, they will freak out. 

If anything memorable happens, I'll make an update. But probably not.","entitledparents",1181,1181,0,0.97,0,0,0,71

Ryan Cohen's father is standing over Godzilla.

Does anyone really know Godzilla's origin?

""On March 1, 1954, just a few months before the film was made, the Japanese fishing vessel Daigo Fukuryk Maru (""Lucky Dragon No. 5"") had been showered with radioactive fallout from the U.S. military's 15-megaton ""Castle Bravo"" hydrogen bomb test at nearby Bikini Atoll. The boat's catch was contaminated, spurring a panic in Japan about the safety of eating fish, and the crew was sickened, with one crew member eventually dying from radiation sickness. This event led to the emergence of a large and enduring anti-nuclear movement that gathered 30 million signatures on an anti-nuclear petition by August 1955 and eventually became institutionalized as the Japan Council against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs. The film's opening scene of Godzilla **destroying** a Japanese vessel is a direct reference to these events and had a strong impact on Japanese viewers with this recent event **still fresh in the mind of the public.**

Oh, Cohen baby, did you really use [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla_(1954_film)) to say what you wanted to say?

[MGGA?](https://twitter.com/ryancohen/status/1454841759104749574)

Mmmm, not seeing any historical context, but MGGA is the short for a chemical reaction for [Mannosylglucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannosylglucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate_synthase)

MGGA is the Catalyst for a process called Guanosine diphosphate mannose or [GDP-mannose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanosine_diphosphate_mannose). This process is found during the process of the metabolism in most living creatures.

Money could be viewed as an ecosystem in some regard so maybe Decentralization would be a supercharged metabolism? Tenuous link, but these are some distinct acronyms that line up. MGGA being a catalytic process is enough for me.

Also the Elemental table symbols for Magnesium and Gallium are Mg and GA.

Here is a paper written for a potential use for temporary implants in osteosynthesis using magnesium. These [implants](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213956720300402) would dissolve in a patient and wouldnt have to require surgery to remove them.

However, it seems more likely that this is him referring to an acronym like FANNG.

MGGA. Easy, Microsoft. GameStop. Google. Apple.

GME is already partnered with Microsoft, uses Google for their cloud computing, and Cohen is still the largest individual shareholder in Apple.

Makes sense. I liked that theory from the start.

# AND GUESS WHO MIGHTVE BEEN RIGHT TWICE AND WAS JUST WAITING FOR THE DOMINOES TO FALL&

# TLDR:

Cohen, Cheng, Loopring, and Members of the GameStop hegemony were trying to tell the apes to want DECENTRALIZATION.

The formula for Cohen tweets goes as follows.

Time = United States Law/Code or protocol for ERC-tokens

Cohen is TELLING THE APES HOW THIS IS ALL LEGAL AND WHY THEY NEED TO PAY.

Date = Famous Event(s) on said date.

Famous events to showcase that TYRANNY AND CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT R FUK.

I mentioned Godzilla.

Cohen does love his family and friends after all, Those three tweets spoke to me more than any of them. 

Cohen made those three tweets special for a reason.

**SO WHEN DO I THINK THE MARKETPLACE IS LAUNCHING AND/OR COHEN WILL SPEAK?**

[**MARCH 1.** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1)

**I got mocked immediately and ignored for saying this. Some of the comments on those initial posts were just delightful in how denigrating they were. Then only months later to see anyone picking this date get showered with updoots and awards&.**

**Felt great&**

**But thats just been my journey with the stonk.**

**Good thing I can laugh at a shitty situation. Being one of those people that mostly doesnt get noticed or commended for anything in life, you tend to understand that if you let the pursuit of notoriety and showboating consume you, itll rob you of humility and authenticity.**

**But guess what, who cares. This is all just fun theories and here say until something major happens. Im grateful that anyone even took the time to read those posts. Hell, Im happy that people finally woke up to March 1st. It thought I was going to be the only crazy one.**

**Any coin I receive from any of my posts I gave to the GME orphans as well to encourage and strengthen their resolve. I think handing out awards and sending a nice comment to the smaller sharehodlers is the right thing to do and I have interacted with some wonderful people over there.**

**Supermans birthday, Godzillas origin. Articles of Confederation, the largest piece of decentralized legislation this country has seen, were ratified on that day.**

**Hate me if you want. If Im wrong, I know yall are going to let me know anyway.**

**Someone needs to try to tell the truth and not just a few words from a source that isnt the chair.**

**Not to mention that GameStop also needed to train all its employees how to deploy the Marketplace AND come up with a way to sell the masses on why an NFT Marketplace is great.**

**Music to shareholders ears, not to the general public. Most people think NFT is just pictures and nonsense, GameStop has to come up with an easier way for most to understand the technology better.**

**Hell say something when it is READY, not for impatient apes who arent planning on Hodling long term. Why screw over long term hodlers for the YOLO bros who want their crashing fiat currency right now.**

**Also to the people saying that Matt Furlong can just announce it. Really? Did any of you even know who he was until he joined GameStop? Im guessing no.** 

**Did most hop on this train for Cohen? Yes. Hes going to make the checkmate, I refuse to believe that Cohen would force his CEO to make the move. Investors want to see Cohen do it, and I think that would be the best move for them to have the chair do it. He had the vision, he should be the one to share it to the world.**

**A great leader takes it upon themselves to do the hard things at the most critical moments, not delegate.**

**Not to say Matt wouldnt be capable of that either, clearly he is qualified. This is just Cohens move to make.**

Well see if Im right. Go nice on me if you are reading this, chair please.

Trust the charts if you wish.

Ill trust the chairman.

He stated that he had never once loved me, and only stayed with me because he enjoyed the attention being with me provided -- I am educated, highly motivated, talented, kind, genuine, if not a bit naive -- and he loved the envy and approval he received. We dated on and off for several years.

But in 2017 I was raped by a homeless man I had helped, and I later discovered I was pregnant. I live in America, I'm pro-choice (even though we both come from religious families with antiquated ideas) and I confided with him over the agony and mixed feelings I had at the time as I considered an abortion. He gently convinced me to keep the child -- promising that together we would raise it, he would start working more so I wouldn't have to as much, and would care for and love us.

I look back with so much pain at my ignorance, that my desire to have a family and a future brimming with happiness and love overpowered my common sense. I convinced myself that he must be the kindest man, that he was choosing to stay with me and take on the challenge of being a father to a child that wasn't his own, and that by offering such a sacrifice, he must truly love me.

I had been deeply neglected as a child, and I've always struggled to believe that I would ever be worth loving. I was over the moon. Looking back, I know now that since I never received love, I wasn't able to recognize the absence of it.

He told me that when he found out about the pregnancy, he felt trapped. He had only ever been using me to feel important, never having any intention of marrying -- let alone loving -- me, but now his family (his narcissistic mother in particular) was expressing to him how cruel he would be to leave me under these conditions. She pressed, saying that if he was a good man, he would marry me, protect me, and care for me, because ""women like me"" are tossed aside by today's society, and he would be saving me and my child.

She pressured him, not because she cared about me, but because she enjoyed telling anyone who would listen what a wonderful mother she was for raising a real life hero.


The idea of playing the role of a savior was deliciously enticing to him, and the back pats and nods of approval spurred his decision to ask me to marry him.

Shortly after giving birth to a beautiful, utterly perfect daughter whom I love more than life, we were married. I had complications during the birth, which resulted in being temporarily disabled. I needed physical therapy, mobility assistance, and a great deal of help for over a year. However, despite the desperate need for help, I was left to raise my daughter alone (even though he was always around, just never bothering enough to care) with no help, no support, and no kindness from anyone. Although, I will say that I am proud of myself for being able to push through those obstacles for the good of my daughter.

My husband would lie to EVERYONE. He would make up stories about how hard it was taking care of me during my physical recovery, fabricating funny anecdotes of things our daughter would do under his attentive care, speaking solemnly on the struggles of fatherhood, and reciting that we were all worth his great sacrifices.

He would be praised, fawned over, and would receive impressed compliments wherever we went. I planned more get-togethers with our families just to get a break, since he needed to put on a show of what a wonderful husband and father he was, and would actually participate.

More than that, however, I would would lie for him, agree with his stories, speak in support of him in public/private when prompted. Partly because I was embarrassed that I had married someone so empty, but I admit, I truly wanted to believe the stories too.

With cost of childcare being out of the question, and with my love and affinity for motherhood (despite the challenge of my newly disabled body) I raised, taught, nurtured, cared for and loved my daughter all on my own. (Please don't pity me for where she came from, it's not her fault. She's perfect. I truly love being her mother, watching her grow and learn. Having the opportunity to peer into her world and play such and an important role, watching her become her own person entirely apart from me, discovering her own interests, experiencing her ever expanding, changing personality has been the most humbling, most incredible honor that I know I don't deserve.)

Living paycheck to paycheck was hard. School for both, medical bills, raising a child and cost of living, I decided to start up a business on the side as well, so that we could start putting savings away to give her a brighter future. I made arrangements to take her to classes with me, went to school full time, worked, all with my little darling at my side.

When the pandemic hit, my business tanked, and left us with an enormous debt. I had to quit school so that I could work more to make up the difference, and my husband agreed that it would be best for me to finish school once he had. From the day we were married, I carried the entire load of planning, of our future, our finances, our child, our home, maintenance, emotional and mental support, along with working all on my own.

But I was slowly, steadily, and painfully burning out.

As a side note, all through this, he would never touch me. There was always a reason: not wanting to hurt me, being traumatized by what had happened to me (rape), the damage of growing up with a narcissistic mother, no sex drive, and even a tearful admittance that he struggled to be attracted to me due to the weight gained during pregnancy. So, despite the mental, physical, and emotional toll it took, I returned to my pre-pregnancy body. Then his excuse was that he was attracted to larger breasts and gently recommended I consider breast enhancement surgery. There was always a reason. I felt ugly, unwanted, and ashamed.

He admitted to me yesterday that not only did he have a preference to porn, but that he had enjoyed the rush of power he felt making me beg and plead for his attention only to deny it, more than he enjoyed sex.

But somehow through it all, I found ""my people"" in the most unexpected place. An online community of primarily women woodworkers (a skill I taught myself because educational toys, child accessible furniture, play equipment during a pandemic wasn't in the budget) and for the first time, I was able learn what it meant to truly be loved

Their genuine friendship and care transformed my expectations, as I broadened my understanding and realized that his distance, dismissiveness, coldness, lies, contradictions, lack of care and utter constant cruelty weren't love, or even ignorance. The love they showed by example empowered me to stand up for myself, because they saw me as I am, and found value in me despite my flaws.

I never told them the truth of what I was suffering. I have never told anyone. I was so ashamed because I was now knowingly putting my child into the hands of a narcissist, and that makes me no better than he is.

Looking back, it was all a mistake. Once I realized these truths, I should've left him, and dealt with the ramifications of that choice. But for some complicated legal reasons around my daughter I can't get into because I don't want it traced back to me (I exploited a legal loophole that could result in having her taken from me), I'm trapped. I thought that now that I had a better understanding of what was happening, that I might be able to convince him to be kind to us, and perhaps buy myself some time to find a way around those legalities, and save up secretly to make an escape.

But when I had the audacity to ask for more from him, insinuating that I was deserving of kindness, honesty, and compassion, my entire world flipped on its head.

Everything suddently became even more confusing. For weeks he would ignore us, and then suddenly jump in and help around the house, taking our daughter out to do fun activities so I could work, being complimentary and helpful. But his kindness was never free, and was used as a weapon in later arguments.

No matter what I did to speak out, he always found a way to twist my words. Even trying to use my newfound voice, I would get brave enough to speak out against him in public, (I knew that in those moments were the only moments he cared enough to listen) but would of course meet his wrath later on, being yelled at and then given the silent treatment for weeks. I would then later be reprimanded by the people present for being judgemental/unkind towards a man who has ""done so much for us"", and be told that ""everyone makes mistakes"" and even a snide ""not everyone here can be as PERFECT as you"" from his Mother.

Everyone we know believes that I'm mean to him, and I'll be the first to admit, that I am mostly to blame for this. I went along with his lies and false stories for so long, and I hate myself for it.

For the last year, I've found everyday wanting him to just hit me already, so that I could understand where the line of reality was. I would imagine up scenarios of getting into an accident and winding up in a coma for a few weeks so I could escape the sheer stress of it all for just a moment.

He told me yesterday, tears in his eyes, that he resents himself for what he's done. However, his resentment is for me surpasses that remorse, and he resents me for being a truly ""better, kinder, gentler"" person than he'll ever be, and is angry that despite his best efforts to suffocate those parts of me so that I'm like him, he hasn't succeeded.

He said that he hates himself for what he's done, but not more than he ""loves"" having control over us, and receiving the unconditional love and care I (we) give freely. That the pleasure he gets in exploiting my kindness, and seeing how far he can push me to break makes him feel more powerful than his conscience. 

He told me all of this yesterday, even though I think I've known for a long time now.

But why now?

I've learned the hard way that burnout is not just an idea, or a mindset. End stage burnout is very, very physical. Every part of my body is failing. (I got covid twice. The first resulted in permanent damage to my autonomic nervous system, and the second resulted in chronic fatigue and miscarriage of a baby I had to beg for.) He told me that he knew I was physically worsening, and chose to play the long waiting game, until my physical capacity was so broken, that I would never be able to leave him.

He also admitted that he had intentionally made the conditions for me to work at my highest capacity impossible. He said he felt emasculated that I frequently made more than him, that he would feign incompetence and intentionally put obstacles in my way you make it impossible for me to save money, so I couldn't ever leave.

He added that he finds a great deal of pleasure in controlling our daughter the same way he controls me, and that he's grown to truly resent her now that she's old enough to speak out against his abuses.



I feel so betrayed. All the work I put into working to heal our relationship, fix myself to cater to his impossible standards, help work through his trauma, all the sacrifices I made for the dreams we never shared and the future he never wanted -- it's all worthless.

I will never be able to convince anyone around me of the gravity of his narcissism, not even to get him the help he truly needs.

The only family who ever knew (or cared) was his very observant father. He had pulled me aside and warned me -- from personal experience, sadly -- strongly against staying with him. When I chose to ignore his warnings, he stepped in as a very protective and involved figure in the lives of my daughter and I. He knew better than I did at the time the sheer magnitude of the obstacles I would face face. But he passed away, before I could truly ever appreciate his life -- the life that I was to inherit.

I have no plan, and no future.

The complex legalities I've yet to face are mountainous, but truthfully, are not nearly as serious as my reality.  I can barely look myself in the eyes knowing that my most precious friend and daughter lives under the roof of this man who has premeditated every action of intentional cruelty against us, and I've allowed it. I don't deserve to be her mother.

I'm utterly paralyzed by fear.




I'm so sorry for the length. I had a lot to get off my chest, and no one to trust enough to tell.



Thank you so so much stranger, for hearing my small cry in the darkness, and being willing to share a small piece of this burden I carry by simply reading my story, the story that hasn't been touched by his lies.

It helps me to feel a little less alone.","TrueOffMyChest",1169,1169,0,0.92,6,0,1,147

There is already a ton of great DD going around about individual parts of the latest filing and I can't be arsed to go digging into every part and basically writing the same thing individuals have. So I would ask you to refer to their posts on individual details I mention here because they've organized it well. Theres also new discoveries and theories every day and if my prediction is right, we havent even seen the final filing yet so anything I can conjecture can ultimately change Monday. Im also not a big fan of tinfoil and grasping at straws. Yes, this post is mainly conjecture but Im trying to arrive at my points with logic rather than connecting things on the wall with string and hoping things stick.

What I am going to do however is take a different approach in this DD. We're going to be talking game theory to figure out what the FUCK has been going on with this company so we're actually going to be looking into the past in order to look into the future. I jumped into this like many of you in mid August right around the 10$ price when it was making its climb and have been following this stock daily since, so my knowledge and timeline will begin from then. Im also still waiting for that guy to have a hot date with a watermelon.

**History**:

Im going to be brief in months leading up to August because I wasnt involved in the day to day then. But basically the tldr is Ryan Cohen had a plan with what to do with BBBY and wanted Buy Buy Baby for himself because he thought it would compliment his other businesses. He bought about a 10% stake in BBBY and then publicly wrote a letter to the board basically telling them what they had to do to improve company. He also called out the CEO for taking a huge salary while running the business into the ground. He used his influence to essentially kick CEO Mark Tritton out and replace with Sue Gove. Sue Goves salary is a modest 1.4Mil compared to Trittons 12 Mil in total compensation in 2020 and 10 mil in 2021. Sue also bought shares herself in the company which she has yet to sell, which Ryan Cohen criticized CEOs on twitter who dont do that. The point is Sue Gove was a very Ryan Cohen friendly appointment. He also put 3 of his own people on the board of directors shortly after his buy-in, 2 of which still remain. 1 which left in December during certain timings but well get to that later.

**August** \- BBBY had a runup and seemed to usually be on a cyclical pattern for such every few months. I cant explain this, probably something with shorts and swaps and I know theres been some good DD on this already in this sub in the past. News breaks out ahead of time that Ryan Cohen sold his position. Many of us holding in the pump immediately called this bullshit out because its very unlike him. Keep in mind also he had a certain waiting period of some number of months before he could sell which opened up right around time of pump. I really dont know if this was calculated or coincidental as far as the runup, but what happened happened. We got the filing the next day and all our jaws dropped along with our portfolios and the army of FUD began. The board immediately released a statement saying theyre continuing their relationship with Ryan Cohen. I want you to keep in mind how talkative and open the company is right now. They didnt have to mention anything. Also there were some stupid lawsuits filed against BBBY and Ryan Cohen during this time about how he just pump and dump and even BBBY called them baseless and the claims had no merit. They ended the month with announcing their turnaround plan which would later be revealed to be an expanded ABL loan and FILO loan, giving them an additional 900 million or so to carry them through the next few months. They also started to do things like focusing better on name brand products instead of crappy in-house brand, closing underperforming stores, basically all things Ryan Cohen suggest they do.

**September** \- Im going to skip over the CFO because I think its unrelated to this tale and I dont like getting conspiratorial surrounding what happened. I do obviously believe it was suicide though. But incidentally it did pile onto the FUD and caused another price drop. We also had our earnings call. I dont really remember much about this one other than it being another underperforming one and strengthened the outlook of bankruptcy. However, Sue did make one very bold claim. She said cash flow would be break even by end of 2nd half 2022. Considering their huge negative cash flow at the moment, that would be quite a feat.

**October** \- The bond exchange offer begins. Basically this is an attempt to convert existing bonds to ones of lesser worth, but chance of having payout in case of bankruptcy unlike current unsecured ones. Also the 2024 bonds would be due in 2027 as well. Sue Gove also got appointed actual CEO instead of acting CEO. Also, they introduced a $150 million ATM share offering. Something they have yet to use. It was interesting that unlike other offerings it was for a specific dollar amount instead of number of shares. And here begins my commentary. Why this particular number? Was this a in case of emergency, break glass situation in case they needed a little more funding for whatever was to come? Did something happen in the next 2 months that made them not wanting or unable to dilute more stock like some agreement with an outsider? Or was this just the first of many attempts to lower their stock price further and why would they do that?

Ryan Cohen also does an interview during this time about why he exited BBBY. [https://youtu.be/uN2Dw8AOdMk?t=2238](https://youtu.be/uN2Dw8AOdMk?t=2238)

Hes very cryptic because he says hes still under a standstill. But basically his reason is very bullshit. Long story short his reasons are things BEFORE he even bought into the company. I will be fair and say another interpretation of this is he had hopes, but after what the company did in the past and him evaluating things more when he bought in he had little hope of a recovery and sold.

**The games begin.**

**November** \- As of this moment I dont know if this is relevant to our tale, but it is still an event to take note of. Several of the big bondholders did agree to a private exchange of their existing bonds for the companys stock. This diluted the total stock a little bit more to our current total of about 117 million shares and wiped a little bit of debt off the table. Now the can kicking begins. The debt offer was initially set to expire Nov 15, but it gets extended 3 days without sweetening the deal. 3 days go, and it gets extended another 2 weeks.. not many more participants and still no deal sweetening. Just a can kick.

**December** \- Same things with bonds. Another can kick, very very little additional participation. This is looking pathetic and desperate. Dec 19, another pathetic can kick of bonds to Jan 4, right around time for their next Earnings Call. Also we get some very important hires that specialize in mainly MERGERS AND ACQUISTIONS. But some bankruptcy or restructuring backgrounds as well. Most importantly M&amp;A superstar David Kastin. [https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/10mqb12/the\_sauce\_is\_in\_the\_details\_everytime\_david/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/10mqb12/the_sauce_is_in_the_details_everytime_david/) Thats all you need to know, but hes relevant for our tale.

**January** \- This month is when the heat is turned up. I have to break this up into separate events with my commentary.

Everyone is anticipating this Earnings Call to see if this company will survive. The date for their supposed earning call nears, but no word. Finally they announce it will be on Jan 10, a week later than projections. The next day we get a huge fat notice on Jan 4th not only are they not extending the bond conversion deal anymore, theyre flat out TERMINATING IT. Besides the private exchanges already for equity, its you lose, go home sir for the bond owners. Those converted bonds would have been a nice chunk of debt theyd reduce. Not a huge amount and probably not what they wanted (if they even did), but they just flat out terminate it instead of saying ok, we didnt get that much participation, but well just convert these that accepted. Why kick the can for 2 months and not sweeten the deal at all and then just flat out cancel it? It makes you look very incompetent or unsure of what youre doing. Also Bankruptcy is high on everyones mind now. If youre filing for bankruptcy you dont have to worry about paying the unsecured bonds! That must be what they think they have to do now and terminated deal!

Jan 5th they release a statement flat out giving their bad numbers for the earnings report. They also say they had some inventory problems over the holidays and was reduced sales. I didnt particularly find this event too FUDy. I think it was a good idea they didnt wait until their earnings to drop the underperforming numbers and the market had a week to digest them before report.

Jan 10 earning call. We get our report. Its short and sweet. Not very good news, but Sue sounds very optimistic? Then she just quickly mic drops and leaves. The fuck? No Q&amp;A? Nothing to say about your 1 month to death bankruptcy? Just Were looking forward to the next quarter. Bye?? Ok, whatever. Um, hey guys. We got the 8-K, but wheres the 10Q (full detailed report of quarterly accounting)?? Oh, maybe tomorrow. Um, is it ever this late? Hey guys, its been 2 days. Whats going on? Whats the latest they can send 10Q before they get in trouble? Um, the day is passed and no 10Q? WHERES THE 10Q LEBOWSKI??

Jan 12th. David Kastin receives 43,852 shares. Wow, this bankrupt company is paying M&amp;A Michael Jordan with toilet paper.

Jan 19 BBBY releases they received warning from NASDAQ about being delisted if they dont release the damn 10Q.

Jan 24. We get a slew of filings about a lot of board members RSAs were being terminated early in exchange for cash. WTF? Are all the board members cashing out before a bankruptcy? No, their asses would be on the line legally. Is this merger and acquisition related?? We have no idea whats going on.

Jan 26, a day that will live in infamy. You want your fucking 10Q?? Have your fucking 10Q! IM GOING TO DROP IT DURING MARKET HOURS, BITCHES. I dont think you realize how insane this is. I mean everyone knew what the numbers were essentially. But this caused a huge algo crash (Price dropped instantly it was released. Algos are apparently always watching for filings and will automatically do huge sells based on certain keywords in documents supposedly). Theres a reason you dont release big filings like that during market hours because of its huge volume. You want to do it before or after market when theres a lot less volume and more time for the information to be digested. We also got a nice little added tidbit in their where it says BBBY had a technical default on their ABL loan that month by not making payment. Thats a pretty big deal, but after further looking into the statement we discovered something interesting. While the loaner could have called default on the loan and possibly for a bankruptcy, they didnt. And we later find out they actually INCREASED the line of credit with a little added interest rate. Something doesnt ad up unless somehow the owner of the loan knew they were going to get paid somehow and soon.

Jan 27th, if you werent done getting trolled by this company yet, here comes another fuck you. Those vested RSAs a few days ago? LOL, J/K. All reversed. EXCEPT Edelman whose were forfeited for no consideration. And we still havent heard why. I dont have anything more to add to this, but just want to say thats kind of fucking weird. It was around this time I started to have a clearly picture that this company was intentionally being confusing. Its been radio silent this month, when in the past theyve been so open like when RC sold.

They also cap off month with announcing theyre closing Harmon brand and additional underperforming stores. People start catching on here the company isnt going bankrupt otherwise they would be in trouble with creditors for closing these assets.

An interesting thing of note was IBKR reporting about bonds planning to be paid on Jan 30, a whole 2 days early than required! But Jan 30 came and no payment. Ok, maybe IBKR just sucks. But why would they have notice about bond payment early? If it was just an automated message wouldnt it be Feb 1st? Did the company tell them the 30th? I guess we just wait for payments on Feb 1.

Also of note this month was a flood of FUD news stories about bankruptcy from sources familiar with the matter including sycamore in talks with BBBY for sell of its assets (bullshit, but reported). People on reddit were decrying lies from the media, myself included, but I came to conclusion theres a chance the media actually were getting these leaks from BBBY intentionally. This whole month was a flurry of deception for everyone. Investors, Hedge fund &amp; market makers, and the media. I noticed trading deadlined and got pretty flat after that 10Q drop. I think the plan from shorts was to start locking the price down hard and wait for any further major news before shorting the price down anymore.

**February** \- Some people report of bond payments, but these might be proactive from broker and will be clawed back when the broker doesnt receive payouts from BBBY. A leaked newstory citing an anonymous source from the company says bonds wont be paid. People saying including an obvious reddit shill that they got email responses about the bonds at 10PM, but others didnt when they also emailed and asked? Confusion about the bonds everywhere.

Im also not going to get into that gift card bullshit. Occams razor, they were taking Harmon off the gift cards and maybe they found a better priced supplier when they switched the vendor.

An interesting thing of note is bond volume has been through the roof the last 2 weeks, even before the deal was announced. I cant help but wonder if this is related or not. Could be a safeguard against acquisition or even part of acquisition. Before we knew of this weeks deal the prevailing theory was someone was going to become a majority bondholder and cancel the debt and make it cheaper to acquire.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1st release of the special financing deal. Its bullish. Bankruptcy is off the table. Stop worrying about that.

Im not going to break down a 100 page document. Theres a lot of good DD on parts of it already as I have mentioned here. However I will highlight some major details of it.

**Mysterious Buyer of the securities**

* Hopefully we should know of this by Monday? But who knows. It isnt a traditional buy common stock deal, so Im not sure on rules of disclosure or if they can even leave name blank on the form like its hidden by NDA or not.
* A news leak said it was Hudson Bay is the investor. I cant remember the site, but a reputable paid financial website had Hudson Bay listed on the details of the security, but we dont know if this is A. The website just using news reporting and was another false leak by company or B. Hudson is the buyer (In which case it could either be a legit investment for itself, or its being used as a facilitator for someone else to acquire the securities from)

**HUGE dilution of the stock (1st draft)**

* Our outstanding shares would basically triple if I remember right? Or almost. This is (was) very bad for us
* Thankfully theres some restrictions in it about how many can be diluted at one time and needing 2-3 months between each.
* The buyer is also restricted to only 9.99% ownership of company at a time.
* Low cost of acquisition. Initial floor on first round of stock something in the $2s, making price floor there (where we are now)

However the company would have over 1 billion to finance itself, taking out a good chunk of its debt and being able to pay bonds. It will survive, but at possible sacrifice of share price. Keep in mind most of the securities are a buy price of over $6, so if whoever is buying this, they would really be incentivized to get the share price over $6 by a bit. The good news is theres rules dictating how often these warrants and preferred stocks can be cashed in so its not possible for a full dilution at once.

On paper and with Hudson this seemed like kind of a scary deal, but still one that might incentivize a short squeeze (as buyer would also have low cost of entry). There were concerns that Hudson could sell these off to other hedge funds to cover their short positions. But Im not sure how wise of an idea that would be, but Ill get to that later in summary of speculation.

**The NDA**

Now this is juicy and suspicious. Ill detail this a little bit because I havent really seen much about it.

\*\*The Company entered into certain confidentiality agreements pursuant to which the Company agreed to publicly disclose certain information, including material non-public information thereunder (the Cleansing Materials), upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the NDAs. The Company hereby provides the following information pursuant to such NDAs:

\-Plans for current store fleet optimization program to be expanded to more than 400, including closure of an approximately 150 additional lower-producing Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores, which builds on closure of approximately 200 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores and approximately 50 standalone Harmon stores in the U.S.

\-Plans for Fiscal 2023 Comparable Sales in mid- to high-single digit range based on Comparable Sales down 30 percent to 40 percent in the fiscal first quarter and sequential, quarterly sales improvement thereafter.

\-Plans for improving inventory position with in-stocks at historical operating levels by Back-to-College 2023.

\-Plans for Fiscal 2023 Adjusted Gross Margin in the low-30 percent range throughout the fiscal year, inclusive of cost savings from supply chain network initiatives.

\-Plans for Fiscal 2023 Adjusted SG&amp;A expense reduction of up to $1 billion, reflecting annualized cost optimization initiatives that began in fiscal 2022, as well as incremental cost reductions associated with additional store closures, as well as corporate and operating expense realignment to occur by early fiscal 2023.

\-Plans for Fiscal 2023 Adjusted EBITDA Margin in mid-single-digit range, based on achievement of aforementioned assumptions and reflecting negative Adjusted EBITDA Margins in the fiscal first quarter and a return to positive Adjusted EBITDA Margins beginning in the fiscal second quarter.\*\*

I just find it odd company plans are being held under NDA. I cant imagine why BBBY would want to keep this specific information confidential. Seems like something theyd love to announce to make a positive press report or statement. So the investor wanted it under NDA until now?? Maybe Im reading too much into it, but its very interesting theres an NDA in first place instead of detailing who is involved. I guess maybe the investor/investing company wants to make the announcement?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Feb 8 we get announcement the deal is actually closed.

Feb 9 we get another amended drop on the deal. And then Feb 10 another. I dont really remember differences in the two so Ill summarize the important changes.

Dilution is a LOT less now. Theres a lot less shares to be diluted, the minimum floor price went up to $6, so no more $2 stocks. Also they increased the amount that BBBY can receive from over 1 billion to 2.6ish billion? So, youre telling me this entire amendment was nothing but bullish for BBBY with no downside? What about the buyer? Is this even a negotiation? It just looks to me like either BBBY (a bankrupting company) is in charge, or the buyer truly wants to BBBY to flourish or pay off all their debt and this isnt just for a quick buck? Also not to mention all the new mentions of Successor Shares in the case of a carveout/M&amp;A.

And then of course they added terms that make it beneficial for the holder of the warrants to not need to execute them to enjoy essentially synthetic ownership of the stock. Imagine having a call option (a right to buy stock at a certain price and thats it) but instead you also get dividends, those successor shares in case of company change, (I think theres been some dispute on voting power, but that might have been amended recently? I cant remember). Basically it is incentivizing the holder to not need to execute the warrants and dilute the stock. Weird. Why would a hedge fund or simple cash investor be interested in this if their goal is just money. The crux to this though is I believe the 9.99% max ownership at a time provision is still in effect. In order for my thesis to be correct, this will have to be changed or removed, or theres another angle to this we havent thought of yet.

In summary of the proposal as it is, its a very long and confusing plan. Its very convoluted with everyone scratching their head as you probably saw reporting of in the media. [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-equity-offering-one-of-the-most-unusual-financing-situations-we-have-witnessed-analyst-says-c0339fde](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bed-bath-beyond-equity-offering-one-of-the-most-unusual-financing-situations-we-have-witnessed-analyst-says-c0339fde)

Even the algos have stopped reacting this week to the amendment drops. They dont know how to process them as bullish or bearish.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Theres also been a lot of other interesting going ons not involved in BBBY but with other companies that you can guess, but I dont want to reach that far for now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So lets conclude and try to guess what has been happening using available data.

I think what's going on is one of two different scenarios this whole time.

**Theory 1**. Occams Razor. No tinfoil, things are exactly as they seem and we have most of the available data. The company has been struggling to find help and ways to survive since RC left. Maybe he didn't like the ABL loan they were planning because it made it more difficult for him to get Baby. He's probably still available for advising and maybe have had some suggestions. They tried some deal with bonds that kind of fell through, whether that was involving some potential acquirer or not to satisfy, who knows. In any case, that's not the plan now. They somehow came across this deal with someone and have been enacting since they terminated the bond deal. They're in active negotiations still at the last minute and updating us on the process. A lot of confusing filings the last couple months are them just struggling to survive and figure things out and being attacked on all sides by deadlines and issues. Regardless they're very skilled people and will be able to turn the company around if the deal goes through. I'm not going to speculate on what Hudson would do if it is them.

**Theory 2**. Ryan has been collaborating with BBBY the entire time to form the company into an ideal buyout situation. Or at the least he gave them a chance to do it themselves or to show him theyre a kind of company hes interested in acquiring. Perhaps he had the idea how last summer and knew it required his exit. Maybe the ABL loan was part of his plan down the line because it happened a couple weeks after his exit. The ATM offering they didnt use was an emergency fund to give them enough runway to survive until the deal. The goal was to create a buyout along with creating a short squeeze for the ages. Ryan Cohen has very publicly hated short sellers. They are constantly devaluing his companies such as GME. In order to do this though they would have to be very very careful to not get in trouble. Lots of Cover your ass which leads to some of the FUD shit the company has been doing. The goal has to been very vague about plans, forward guidance, so being optimistic, but at the same time basically FUDing with reality of their situation, again CYA (were going bankrupt so we had to do things this way!) So the company does constant misdirection. Makes ATM offer, never uses. Makes bond offer, never sweetens deal, kicks can 4 times, then terminates. Misses filing 10Q risking delisting, releases 10Q during market, releases filing about terminating board RSUs, retracts RSU termination a couple days later. It seems like the company is very incompetent and about to die. Shorts go overboard. Somehow though Sue knew everything would be ok in January during ER despite it being the hardest month for them from organization standpoint. They default on their loan. JPM had enough confidence in them to not call them out on it, and to even expand the loan. (WTF?) So this plan has been going on since January at latest and it very much satisfied JPM. So despite that, we still have active negotiations? NDA not disclosing who the investor is and if you read yesterdays filing the things under NDA are details for a turnaround plan. Things I cant really imagine a hedge fund giving a shit about not disclosing. And BBBY obviously would want to expand on their positive guidance to restore brand confidence. So in these ongoing negotiations with the updated filings, the recent one improved BBBYs position a LOT with no downside or sacrifices. Why would other party agree to that? I guess only case is so they could potentially get more cheaper shares (if stock price over $6) But I dont really see what all is in it for them. We also made an interesting discovery that this amount of dilution would be in total over 50% of company.

This leads me to conclude a couple things if it is Ryan.

1. The deal will change once again a final time, either when they announce name on filing or right before. They might just take out the 9.99% max ownership. He can just buy all the stocks No dilution. He just owns company. Maybe theres another angle to this and everyone distracted by the shares like this was a bond play as well with the huge volume the last 2 weeks.
2. Maybe Hudson is involved and is a facilitator. They will just sell the shares 10% at a time to RC directly eventually adding up to over 50%. But I dont really get this idea because RC would have to disclose after 10% ownership. I havent really given this angle too much thought though. Like I said the 9.99% max ownership is the crux to this and maybe theres a loophole Im not thinking of.

A little bit of tinfoil: 1. All those sources close to the matter actually were BBBY and they were spreading FUD to media. Bankruptcy Friday, every Friday. Were missing bond payments. Sycamore wants to buy us. Now Hudson Bay is the company financing this. Etc.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Final point**, Im not 100% saying its Ryan. As Ive stated, this could just simply be a company struggling to survive and making a few missteps along the way, but somehow acquiring key talent like David Kastin? Maybe he just liked the challenge. I would conservatively put the odds over 50% of it being him though. And with that I want to end highlighting his 4 points to improve BBBY based on his letter to the board last March.

*1. Bring Greater Focus to the Companys Cumbersome Strategy*

This is summed up with this explanation:

Our own experience taking Chewy from a start-up to the ultimate destination for pets leads us to believe that focusing on a core set of objectives drives superior outcomes. In the case of Bed Bath, it appears that trying to execute on dozens of initiatives at once is leading to dozens of mediocre outcomes. We believe the Company would have been better served by front-loading the modernization of its supply chain and technology stack before engaging in more fanciful pursuits.

BBBY has since RC left:

* Closed underperforming stores.
* Focused on more quality products.
* Greatly improved its technology space investment and online shopping and delivery capabilities, a costly investment despite near bankruptcy
* Closed the Harmon brand
* Restructuring its Canadian subsidiary

I also want to include this quote from this point. In light of our long-term focus, we are not an investor that demands guidance. In fact, we appreciate that Apple, one of our long-term holdings, suspended guidance amidst pandemic-related uncertainty and has never given away a detailed strategy for all of its competitors to see. We dislike when a management team spends time accommodating Wall Street, engaging with television pundits and telegraphing forecasts to the competition. We believe managements time is best spent focusing on execution that drives a better customer experience and tangible value creation.

Sue has not been in front of tvs. Shes been working hard on a turn around for the company and their statements have provided very little or no guidance in last 2 quarters.

*2. Seek to Monetize the Ultimate Destination for Babies*

Another path that can streamline Bed Baths strategy and unlock value trapped within the Companys underperforming shares is a sale or spin-off of the BABY banner.

In the event Bed Bath pursued a full or partial sale of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt, put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value for shareholders. Spinning off shares of BABY would be an even more efficient way to transfer value to shareholders. Notably, BABYs high online penetration would likely ease operational hurdles. We assume Bed Bath and BABY could still have a shared services agreement to maintain an omnichannel experience for customers.

Ill leave it at that.

*3. Evaluate a Full Sale to a Well-Capitalized Acquirer*

TBD, self explanatory

*4. Strengthen Leaderships Alignment with Shareholders*

We are supportive of corporate leaders receiving significant compensation when they produce superior shareholder returns. But when it comes to Bed Bath, we contend there need to be improvements to the Companys executive compensation structure and a stronger ownership mentality in the boardroom. We believe these improvements should be made regardless of the Companys strategic direction.

Sue Gove has a modest salary of 1.4M and even bought more shares last summer instead of being handed them.

&amp;#x200B;

When moon? No dates, always tomorrow. RC in or out, doesnt matter. This company survived bankruptcy and is given the time to turn itself around even with with worst interpretations of this deal.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Because it was requested I have over 1000 shares and a few hundred calls. I'm not going to detail them because my calls could easily change, as I change them a lot. Also people from the original discord can verify that because I've posted my positions a few times there.","BBBY",1152,1152,0,0.96,22,2,0,140

She posted them with a caption saying ""sorry, not sorry"" knowing that we have asked everyone in our family not to post pictures of our kids online. He and I were very angry at seeing this and felt like her juvenile comment was as though receiving a direct slap in the face, another sign of her disrespect and disregard for us as parents.

Husband has always had a hard time putting up with my mom's entitled, narcissistic behavior that has only gotten worse since she became a grandmother. As an example, I wanted to do a 30 day confinement after my first for various reasons. When I told my mom she replied ""you can't keep the baby away from me, I'm the grandma!"" Even emotionally extorting visits with us during the pandemic (when she and my stepfather chose not to get vaccinated themselves) because my poppop is almost 95 and ""isn't going to be around much longer so this could be the last chance he has to see the kids"".

Well, after this morning, it was the straw that broke the camel's back and he sent my mom a lengthy message that enough is enough. She has at this point shown both of us (but more importantly me) so much disrespect through the years that he has told her not to contact us anymore. She doesn't seem to be taking him seriously and even claimed that I told her it was ok to post the pictures, which is 100% false.

Update: Just to respond to multiple commenters in one place and provide more info...I have spent most of my young adult and adult life trying to handle my mom and her issues. I did so on my own for many years and, more recently, with assistance from my therapist. Conversations, letters, and numerous other methods of getting the same message across have been unsuccessful. She believes rules do not apply to her. In any context, but especially with her children whom she doesn't accept are adults and parents in their own right. She believes that her needs and wants come first, always.

Before my.husband took any action at all, he asked me if he could step in in support of me, knowing that my mom has a way of manipulating me into backing off on some of the boundaries. So she has a history of getting her way with me. We decided we weren't going to let that happen this time. Granted, I may not have expected my husband would take such a hardline stance and ask for no contact. However, lesser things have not indicated to her that there is need for her to change her ways.

All this being said, we are waiting for her to take this demand seriously as she is showing signs of not believing that we are cutting off contact for the time being. I'm not sure how I will react if/when she decides to reach out to me directly. On the one hand I know that I need to have a backbone and show her that we mean business when it comes to the boundaries we have in place to protect our family from different potential threats. On the other hand, she's my mom and I want her to be a part of our lives, hence giving her nine lives to allow her opportunities to show us that she does respect our wishes as parents. I just hope with my husband's support and that of my friends and you lovely people that I can hold my ground as she tries to claw her way back.","JUSTNOMIL",1136,1136,0,0.97,1,0,0,175

I was initially planning on being a commercial pilot after high school and studying for it, getting some flight classes in, however the pandemic hit in the middle of my graduation year leading to all the piloting schools nearby being shut down. Not wanting to do nothing i got myself a job and have been funding myself to regular college studying architecture in the meantime. Here's the thing, I haven't given up on being a pilot, I just need to put it aside since I'm unable to do anything with it now, but i still make a point to study out of my textbooks when i have the time home from the dorm. 

  
Now here's the thing, last week i found out after taking a few weeks away from home to focus on midterms in my dorm that my family has been letting this gowniaki fuck around with the shit in my room, he hadn't broken anything seriously important and i had left my room unlocked so i initially chalked it up to both my and my family's incompetence. So I told them that my nephew was destroying things in my room, that there are alot of important items in there and to not let him play with the things in there. When i left last week i locked the door. 

  
This week i come back and the door is wide open. The lock is easy to unlock all you need is a pencil and to shove it into the keyhole, but it still has to be done purposefully. All the sharp items in my room were removed like pushpins and knives, and my nephew is a toddler so he wouldn't be able to unlock it. When i went into my room it turns out he has gotten his way onto my bookshelf full of piloting stuff, he broke my model planes and tore up my books, some of which were textbooks or vintage and will take hundreds of dollars to replace them. Not only has one person in the house fully well knowing he was fucking with my shit that cost hundreds of dollars, they went out of their way to do it and also baby proof the goddamned room so the piece of shit gowniaki wouldn't get hurt doing so. Not only this but no one else in the house saw enough of a problem to even close the door, not even lock it just close the fucking door to my room.    


I'm so ungodly pissed off but I know i can't do anything about it. I can't move all my stuff to my dorm and i can't move out into my own place cause I've been spending the money i had from when i started working at 16 so i can go get an education. Nor would i be able to afford a place nearby enough to my college to walk to that i can afford with my wages, even with roommates. My family has regularly destroyed expensive shit of mine because they disapproved of it (they wanted me married off and a SAHM when i turned 18) and basically any life besides that they disapprove of.","childfree",1135,1135,0,0.99,0,0,0,119

**Background by** u/djreshiram

Vince Staples has been a staple of my music listening since I was 17 years old. He and I grew up in the same city, Long Beach. Vince is from the northside of town, where I lived from 2006-2008. It was a rough couple of years, as within that time I was in 3rd through 5th grade. We had been robbed in that house in broad daylight. My grandmother passed away in Arizona when we were living there. A relative from that side moved in with us and made things rough for the family. North Long Beach wasnt my favorite place. Ironically, I would spend a lot more time in North Long Beach when I was in High School, as most of my school friends lived up there. Its a place you learn to love, because at the end of the day, its the people that come from North Long Beach that you love. Theres great people who come from all walks of life in the Northside. While theres no denying its another dangerous neighborhood in the greater Los Angeles area, its just another factor of life that shapes you to who you become.

I may have a different ear to Vinces music because of my background, but Vince is by far my favorite rapper. Him and System of a Down are my two favorite artists ever. Forever, 18 year old u/djreshiram was convinced that [*Summertime 06*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_medmxEizfe46ruJybOwAbSxoREBh_PoHM) was one of the greatest albums ever. In hindsight I dont fully agree, but at that age, to hear someone who came from where I came from, make art like that? I was hooked. I saw Vince in 2015 at Flog Gnaw when they didnt even announce he was playing until we checked the app that day. He opened with the full version of [06](https://soundcloud.com/adultswimsingles/vince-staples) before going into [Blue Suede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJLfCBBcZAo). I immediately saw him again at the El Rey. That was the only time I saw him play [Nate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdQN5xTuFUM).

I followed Vince through the years as he remained in my rap hierarchy alongside K. Dot, Tyler, Earl, Denzel, Q, Danny, Rocky and Mac. [*Prima Donna*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_myz9HsRZActVJ35Xo6OO0e0hJgnvRMhPU) and [*Big Fish Theory*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_n98-iurWG5FdxK2pdV71vltAvY-fzrcHo) were regular listens for me as I took the train to Hollywood for college from 2016-2018. I greatly appreciated what Vince was doing compared to everyone else. He was, in my opinion, pushing the genre forward with these unconventional, and quite experimental rap projects. What separates Vince the most from other experimental hip-hop artists was his ability to be mainstream. Albeit a Sprite campaign helps, Vince has been able to find a more mainstream audience than just the pigeonhole of experimental rap fans.

The reason? Vince has always made pop music. As in, Vinces music has always followed pop song structures while holding his production and engineering value to the par. [Norf Norf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb6Jc4juSF8) constantly resurfaces to new audiences time and time again, and its probably due to Vinces infectious hook tied with Clams Casino simplistic spooky production. The E-40 assisted, Kenny Beats produced [FUN!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz9-pXuvFEU) off of Vinces west coast tribute [*FM!*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ni9oEVcpiIjTnW6G3FS7aC6DtIcPx0QAs)*,* saw commercial placement. His latest smash, [MAGIC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7M5f2vF4PVw), off the album Ill be diving into in a sec, led a [Beats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNEc-690aMU) marketing campaign. Then Vince led an [Acura campaign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5iMxsJDK8o) with several songs off said album. Theres no denying the mainstream appeal of Vince Staples.

To present time, it feels like weve entered a new era for the Long Beach rapper. Of course, age and the pandemic we all just endured will shape you as a person, but Vinces evolution has been a sight. His [self-titled](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m0n7-Sp5WGgwmOaf0UY5Y9rKm_0N4PIm8) fourth album is a special album for me personally. Its by far his most beautiful album, and in the most haunting ways. In my opinion, Vince captures what growing up in Long Beach is, in musical form, very well with the self titled. The album lyrically deals with growth and reflection, with the production very 808 heavy and modern. [Taking Trips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hA3L6kHMTwY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_m0n7-Sp5WGgwmOaf0UY5Y9rKm_0N4PIm8&amp;index=5) had teleported me to a specific time in my life. Back when I was living in the Northside, I remember hiding under my bed playing my Gameboy Advance as my parents were arguing. The almost 8-chip synth from Monte Booker paired with the Kenny Beats 808 sounded exactly like that moment in time for me.

Much like *Summertime 06* felt for me when I was 18, *Vince Staples* feels like some monumental work of art that is untouchable, and it has become one of my favorite albums. So to say I was excited that Vinces follow-up came a year later, would be an understatement.

[*Ramona Park Broke My Heart*](https://open.spotify.com/album/2G549zeda2XNICgLmU0pNW?si=UUQVC4cDRaych3ZRPplDug) is the 5th studio album by Vince Staples. The album sees the artist take on the west coast sound again. While *FM* was a homage, *Ramona Park Broke My Heart* is another reflection of Vinces life, much in the vein of *Vince Staples*. Given both albums were being made at the same time (he mentions this during an interview I cannot for the life of me remember or Id source that statement), the lyrical consistencies of the two projects make sense. The main difference is that on *Vince Staples*, the artist focuses on himself, whereas *Ramona Park* is about his surroundings, neighborhood and the people close to him.

Furthermore, *Ramona Park Broke My Heart* is a very tongue in cheek album, with Vince playing heavily into the theme of love. Vince cleverly disguises his LA street talk with more theatrically romantic lyrics, while touching on his experience with women. To say the least, Vince enjoys the bachelor life. Love however, comes in other forms with Vince appreciating those around him, like family and friends, specifically those from his set.

The title is also very literal. Ramona Park is the neighborhood in North Long Beach Vince grew up in. The rapper has expressed his appreciation for his hood throughout the career, but this is the first project where Vinces outlook is more constructive. As the title suggests, Vince has had turmoil with where hes from, and even though hes shown his love for the city, it hasnt been the best. The comparison of being in a toxic relationship and living the LA Street life isnt far-fetched. I couldnt think of a better person for the task than Vince Staples to execute such an analogy.

As someone who has also experienced heartbreak from North Long Beach, I greatly enjoyed *Ramona Park Broke My Heart*. The album is my number 2 AOTY (Rosalías *Motomami* was 1) and my hip-hop AOTY. Vinces 5th album is unique from his others, as the 28 year old gives us more maturity tied with his lowkey pop sensibility.

**Review** by u/djreshiram

**THE BEACH**

Seagulls, waves and a roaring crowd looming; the album opener is a short one minute prelude, setting the tones and themes of the album immediately. As the title suggests, Vince takes you to the shores of California, but not in the vein theyre often depicted in movies. Vinces shores are full of struggling people trying to make it to the top, as well as street violence that seems like it will never end. His performance comes off more as a warning than a threat, as he raps well in sync with the minimal organ-sounding keys produced by Mingo.

While Vince has consistently talked about Long Beach throughout his career, this time he seems more reluctant than inclined to dive through his past. Vince sounds as mature as ever, as we move onto track 2 with gunshots and laughter.

**(AYE!) FREE THE HOMIES**

Angelic vocals over west coast synths and delayed guitars open up (AYE!) FREE THE HOMIES. Snippets from a young boy are heard throughout the album, the first being about the emotions felt through the hood. The loss of friends, both to the prison system and to gang violence, is a sentiment heard often in Vinces music, yet here, Vince reveals his true feelings.

The feel-good west coast production, lavished with bouncy synth bass and snaps, brought by LeKen Taylor is juxtaposed by Vinces life reflections, leading to his current outlooks on life. As the hook goes, it seems the rapper has everything he could need. He has a successful career and is getting money. Unfortunately, it means little when the people he loves arent with him.

The verses dissect the truths about Vince, that he is forever a product of his environment. He stands with the streets he came up with, and will continue to do so until the end of time. As he discusses his trials and tribulations, the grim outlook is the same. Vince is down with his cause, no money or success could ever change his feelings. His yearn for revenge for his deceased friends and his outlook on retaliation is what made him the man he is today, and nothing can change that. Vince is ever honest as he is sharp with the pen.

**DJ QUIK**

Very few west coast artists are as legendary and essential as DJ Quik. His iconic diss track [Dollaz + Sense](https://open.spotify.com/track/5xEm63lXBhJKZgjRDMWH3H?si=8ede5a6316074195) is the centerpiece of this song, with the man himself supplying the scratches.

The lowkey beat produced by Nami, DJ Dahi and Coop the Truth features down-tuned keys, with a booming bass and a unique swing in the drums.

Vince opens the song with a verse with similar sentiments as the previous track. Hes about his set and about his money. Vince throughout the album mentions how he cannot be with a woman. The first essence of that appears here as he insists on getting money over chasing girls.

The hook echoes DJ Quik further, as Vince interpolates the iconic lyrics If it dont make dollars, then it dont make sense, showing his agreement with the line. Verse 2 continues the money talk as well as opens up some more cold truths. One of the most striking lines in the track is Vince saying to close your mouth while talking to a killer, following with a conflicting statement, as he claims innocence after being accused. The track concludes after another hook.

**MAGIC**

One of the lead singles, the Mustard produced (co-produced with My Best Friend Jacob and Twice As Nice) banger is Vince doing what he does best. A fantastic catchy hook tied with his unique west coast language leads to one of the hottest moments on the albums. Mustard and Vince made a special record.

Vinces verses are full of slick street talk. Leaning into the west coast influence, Vince opens the verse with a rewrite of Kurupts iconic opening line on Snoop Doggs posse cut [Aint No Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8qgp3yT1rQ). The lyrics continue with themes of needing magic in order to make it out of the street environment. The second verse follows suit ending with a clever play-on of a 38. special pistol.

The song ends with a spoken word bit from Mustard over grand horns and a blistering synth solo. This song is a rare hit that you can tell is made to be one, but unlike most circumstances, the people pulling the strings know what theyre doing. MAGIC is made for radio play, and its done with taste and precision.

**NAMELESS**

A short interlude before the next song, Nameless is another spoken word part following the boy from the opening of (AYE!) FREE THE HOMIES. The boy sounds grown and rather intelligent for his age, as he discusses the possibility that he shot somebody. However much like Vince on DJ QUIK, the boy claims innocence as bullets have no names.

**WHEN SPARKS FLY**

A standout track to most and for good reason, WHEN SPARKS FLY is a love song like no other. The trip-hop-esque beat produced by Frano features a down-tuned sample hook, taking from UK artist Lyves song [No Love](https://open.spotify.com/track/0s0lon2hvHPr6ztXe6iztj?si=49c77c758bd341c5).

Vinces lyrical storytelling takes a tour de France on the track. On the surface this is a broken love song about having somebody and then losing them. However, as Vince will state in a later track, he doesnt make love songs.

The song is about Vinces burner AKA his gun. The lyrically cleverly alludes to this through slick wordplay. Vince talks about how the author of the song is the real thing, and not a ghost, referring to ghost guns. He talks about not wanting to use protection but putting a glove on. An innuendo on protective sex, Vince is actually being literal, talking about needing a glove when shooting the gun, to not leave behind fingerprints.

The song is filled with smart wordplay like that as the entendres continue with the story. In the first verse we establish the love relationship between the author and another person. The second verse takes a turn, as the author was abandoned with no reason given by the other person. Yet the author still misses the person, waiting for the return. In reality, Vince is referring to hiding the gun after using it for illegal activities. The author, while showing some remorse and anger for being put away, is all in all worried and confused.

The humanizing of a weapon is meek and grim. However, Vinces ability to captivate the listener, miraging it as a relationship, is truly the craftsmanship of a great writer.

The song ends with another spoken word snippet, this time featuring a woman. Through context we can assume the woman may have been in a relationship with the boy from NAMELESS as she mentions her person is in jail for killing someone. Allegedly. The beach is heard in the background and through the next track.

**EAST POINT PRAYER**

The next song on the album is produced by Kenny Beats. Kenny and Vince have been an undefeated combo for sometime. The vocal sample and piano ridden beat is paired with a more sentimental performance from Vince.

EAST SIDE PRAYER is about Vinces time in Atlanta, which he left for after getting into some trouble in California. His verse further cements the themes of sticking by your hood and never wanting to leave it, being, in a way, in love with it.

A second verse comes from Atlantas own Lil Baby. Much like Vince, he reminisces on his past life in the hood. Both artists seem contemptuous with the decisions they made in life, afterall it got them to where they are today.

**SLIDE**

Setting the tone for SLIDE, the song opens with a snippet of a man discussing a drive-by shooting that had occurred previously. The Mike Hector and Zack Sekoff produced track is a nod to the drive-by. The spooky piano and vocal samples lay for a more energetic Vince performance.

Vince gives us the familiar street talk, once again alluding to being a killer, but claiming innocence after. Vince spits 2 short 8 bars on the shortest full length song on the album.

**PAPERCUTS**

PAPERCUTS features more production from DJ Dahi. The beat focuses on a vocal sample from bedroom pop artist Hether before turning into a bouncy trap record with a quirky synth lead on the hooks. The song has plenty of other synth sounds to accompany it.

Lyrically, we see Vince evolve into a more elder figure, as hes a veteran in the streets. He once again preaches the message of money over everything, but touches on deeper topics such as how he doesnt care how people will feel about him when hes dead. Vince gets into his distastes such as the music industry, and the questions hes asked about his past. All in all, he gives a sentiment of just wanting to be left alone. He tells everyone to say whats up if they see him and thats it, as money is his only motivation.

Vince delivers more clever entendre such as the one in the second verse, where he discusses the one who got away. He is not referring to a woman, as he refers to someone from his past he shot at, but missed. He also mentions how hard it is to have love for anything when youre broke, solidifying his message further than money fixes problems.

**LEMONADE**

Thematically, LEMONADE is another well placed track in the fantastically sequenced album. Produced by LeKen Taylor, District Yori and Beat Gang Worldwide, the song is an uptempo summer feel record with a filtered sample, west coast percussion and a feature from Ty Dolla $ign.

Vince used Lemonade as an analogy for life in the hood. As he says in the hook, sometimes life is bittersweet. The rapper continues his street talk, expressing his ice cold demeanor time and time again. He once again, expresses money is king, and speaks on how people with no money are the ones with nothing to lose. Vince remains wary of stuff like women, believing a promiscuous girl is attempting to set him up.

Ty closes the song out with some excellent vocal chops, as both artists continue the west coast hip-hop homage theme. Vince in verse one shoutouts [Suga Free](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ZAEMU1aaMpCQXKLJiuI7Q?si=vgXwIg39Sr2iVm3s_Ggwcw), and Ty makes reference to the classic Dove Shack song [Summertime in the LBC](https://open.spotify.com/track/7yOze3trRklt4gGPGyjVwN?si=75aa7e1d23be4a6d).

**PLAYER WAYS**

Up until this point on the album, Vince hasnt discussed his relationship with women outside of expressing the belief that most women are about money. On PLAYER WAYS he sees himself as the title suggests, a player.

Produced by Jonas Koch, SAINT MINO and LBambino, the song follows the production tread of filtered samples, smooth keys and modern drums but in more traditional hip-hop patterns.

Vince discusses how he still likes to be with women, he just doesnt want to be tied down or involved with a single woman. Vince uses sex as a vice for his past, and keeps a pimp aesthetic.

Truthfully we see the root of Vinces ways, as he expresses trust issues amongst other things. He writes about how he knows a woman hes interested in wouldnt stick around and further was talking to another man. Yet Vince still shows some hope, as he states they might work it out later. On his second verse he finds himself pleading with the person, stating that shed have to get over his past woman if she ever wanted it to work.

The song is revealing to Vinces true nature towards relationships. He clearly sees something in an individual but due to a history of trauma and trust issues, its hard to stay committed, not to mention his appreciation for being a player.

The song ends with another spoken word snippet of a woman talking about how willing she was to do anything for her man. In the end though, it was all an illusion, as the woman expresses her feelings of being used.

**MAMAS BOY**

This song is not the loving tribute to a mother most would expect. On MAMAS BOY Vince doesnt talk about how much he loves his mom, he talks about how he loves the streets as much as his mom.

The Nami and Coop The Troop produced track again features lush organ chords and filtered, mind altering sounds throughout. After doing an Outkast reference in the beginning, Vince opens up the first verse with more money and street talk. He continues this energy through the song.

The short song ends with a sample of a mother discussing how if she spent more time with her song, he might have turned out better, but due to her needing to work multiple jobs to support her family. It was difficult. This further goes with the theme that money can solve problems.

**BANG THAT**

The second Mustard offering, also produced by Cardo and Johnny Juliano, is BANG THAT. Vince shows his allegiance for all things money and all things streets by stating hell rep it to the fullest.

The song comes right in with the hook, featuring piano chords and a vocal synth line. The drums are more trap than west coast but still has some of that bounce you expect from those 3 iconic producers.

With all the talk of cash and gang banging throughout, this song doesnt bring any new themes. However, Vince gives us more of a structured song, with 2 verses and a bridge. The bridge in particular is an excellent performance from the rapper, who dubs his voice in a very melodic way, almost singing on his main vocal track.

**THE SPIRIT OF MONSTER CODY**

The final interlude on the album is an insert from a Kody Scott interview. The interlude ties one of the underlying messages of Vince Staples, which is to free everybody locked up in the prison system.

Vince clearly believes in second chances, as some can say music gave him a second chance. He understands that hes more fortunate than other people who get caught up in the tropes of the ghetto. Kodys speech exemplifies these ideas that people can change and deserve a chance at it. Scott talks about how he feels he was set up to fail from the beginning, and that those around him gave up on him before he could have a chance. As disheartening as that is, Cody uses the thug spirit, alla Tupacs Thug Life, to overcome the hardships he had, such as being involved in gangs and being in prison.

The rappers beliefs on prison reform get highlighted in one of the best interludes in recent memory as it leads into track 15.

**ROSE STREET**

Vince opens this song with the line I dont do no love songs, which remains a true statement. The Tommy Parker and SAINT MINO produced track features one of the bounciest 808s on the album, alongside effect-driven vocal samples and chords.

Vince's outlook on love is truly highlighted here, almost as a grand finale. The trust issues he scratches the surface on are fully revealed in the hook, as Vince states he can only bring flowers to his deceased friends grave, further showing his allegiance to his set over anything else.

Still in the verse, Vince seems to be talking to whoever the one for him is, laying down his guidelines for his ideal relationship. To no surprise, he lets it be known that the set comes first then money comes next. Even if she begs, Vince would leave if theres a dollar to make or a rival to slay. He makes it clear to her in the second verse as well, that it might not all be okay. Its the life he lives and nothing can stop it, not even a person he might like or love. The song ends with a phone answer, as Vince calls the local flower shop to get some flowers.

**THE BLUES**

In rare form, Vince finds himself at the most introspective point in his life on THE BLUES. As the title would suggest, the final track has him feeling sad. With guitar and whirly keys over a crashing tide, in a melancholic performance, Vince reveals his true feelings on himself.

Through the whole album, Vince is damn near proud of his affiliation to the streets and his ability to make ends meet, but he seems troubled on the means of his existence and how he got there. The heartbreak truly sinks in, as Vince realizes these things he loved cant be forever. Gang life is becoming more and more his past as he reaches new levels of success in his career.

The truth is, Vinces past has molded him into an individual that may not align with his current life. He realizes that no matter how much money he makes, how big his house is, theres still unresolved turmoil from his past. Theres always a chance that hell have to pay for something he might have done. Theres no true escape, and yet due to his success he must take the higher road, even if that isnt what Vince wants.

THE BLUES is an important song in understanding Vince Staples. Not the artist Vince Staples, not the gang member Lil Fade, but the human being, Vincent Jamal Staples.

&gt;**Executive Summary**

&gt; Only a few market events in an investors career really matter, and among the most important of all are superbubbles. 1 These superbubbles are events unlike any others: while there are only a few in history for investors to study, they have clear features in common.

&gt; One of those features is the bear market rally after the initial derating stage of the decline but before the economy has clearly begun to deteriorate, as it always has when superbubbles burst. This in all three previous cases recovered over half the markets initial losses, luring unwary investors back just in time for the market to turn down again, only more viciously, and the economy to weaken. This summers rally has so far perfectly fit the pattern.

&gt;The U.S. stock market remains very expensive and an increase in inflation like the one this year has always hurt multiples, although more slowly than normal this time. But now the fundamentals have also started to deteriorate enormously and surprisingly: between COVID in China, war in Europe, food and energy crises, record fiscal tightening, and more, the outlook is far grimmer than could have been foreseen in January. Longer term, a broad and permanent food and resource shortage is threatening, all made worse by accelerating climate damage.

&gt;The current superbubble features an unprecedentedly dangerous mix of cross-asset overvaluation (with bonds, housing, and stocks all critically overpriced and now rapidly losing momentum), commodity shock, and Fed hawkishness. Each cycle is different and unique  but every historical parallel suggests that the worst is yet to come.  
  
***

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**The Times that Really Matter for Investors**

&gt; Most of the time (85% or thereabouts) markets behave quite normally. In these periods, investors (managers, clients, and individuals) are happy enough, but alas these periods do not truly matter. It is only the other 15% of the time that matters, when investors get carried away and become irrational. Mostly (about 12% of the time 2 ), this irrationality is excessive optimism, when you see meme stock squeezes and IPO frenzies, such as in the last 2 years; and just now and then (about 3% of the time), investors panic and sell regardless of value, as they did at 666 on the S&amp;P in 2009 and with many stocks trading at a 2.5 P/E in 1974. These times of euphoria and panic are the most important for portfolios and the most dangerous for careers. (Keynes famous Chapter 12 would suggest that when confronted with a bubble, running off the cliff with company is the safest strategy for managers, whose business imperative, after all, is to be a permabull, where the real money can be made. This is a strategy adopted reasonably enough by almost everyone. 3 )

&gt;This 15% is very different from ordinary bull and bear markets. Averaging ordinary bull and bear markets with this handful of outliers dilutes the data and produces misleading signals. My strong suggestion is to treat the superbubbles  2.5 to 3 sigma events  as special, collectively unique occasions. It is as if there is a phase change in investor behavior. After a long economic upswing and a long bull market, when the financial and economic systems look nearly perfect, especially with low inflation and high profit margins, as does the friendliness of the authorities, especially toward cheap leverage, there gets to be a flashpoint, like that summer evening when every last flying ant takes off simultaneously. This effect luckily creates measurable events in the market. So you can see the explosion of confidence and speculation and crazy wishful thinking regardless of value however you wish to define it. And outcomes from this unique group of superbubbles (just three in modern times in the U.S. before this current one) are indeed special: the much discussed (by us) divergence between conservative and speculative stocks; the rapid bear market rallies discussed later here; the rapid onset of recession (3 out of 3 incidents to date, with 1 mild  2000  and the other 2  1929 and 1972  severe); and finally, the much increased probabilities of further unexpected financial and economic accidents.

&gt;Weve been in such a period, a true superbubble, for a little while now. And the first thing to remember here is that these superbubbles, as well as ordinary 2 sigma bubbles, have always  in developed equity markets  broken back to trend. The higher they go, therefore, the further they have to fall. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**The Stages of a Superbubble**

&gt;My theory is that the breaking of these superbubbles takes multiple stages. First, the bubble forms; second, a setback occurs, as it just did in the first half of this year, when some wrinkle in the economic or political environment causes investors to realize that perfection will, after all, not last forever, and valuations take a half-step back. Then there is what we have just seen  the bear market rally. Fourth and finally, fundamentals deteriorate and the market declines to a low.

&gt;Lets return to where we are in this process today. Bear market rallies in superbubbles are easier and faster than any other rallies. Investors surmise, this stock sold for $100 6 months ago, so now at $50, or $60, or $70, it must be cheap. Outside of the late stage of a superbubble, new highs are slow and nervous as investors realize that no one has ever bought this stock at this price before: so it is four steps forward, three steps back, gingerly exploring terra incognita. Bear market rallies are the opposite: it sold at $100 before, maybe it could sell at $100 again.

&gt;The proof of the pudding is the speed and scale of these bear market rallies.

&gt;1. From the November low in 1929 to the April 1930 high, the market rallied 46%  a 55% recovery of the loss from the peak.
2. In 1973, the summer rally after the initial decline recovered 59% of the S&amp;P 500's total loss from the high.
3. In 2000, the NASDAQ (which had been the main event of the tech bubble) recovered 60% of its initial losses in just 2 months.
4. In 2022, at the intraday peak on August 16th, the S&amp;P had made back 58% of its losses since its June low. Thus we could say the current event, so far, is looking eerily similar to these other historic superbubbles.
 
&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Fundamentals Threaten to Fall Apart**

&gt;Economic data inevitably lags major turning points in the economy. To make matters worse, at the turn of events like 2000 and 2007, data series like corporate profits and employment can subsequently be massively revised downwards. It is during this lag that the bear market rally typically occurs.

&gt;Why are the historic superbubbles always followed by major economic setbacks? Perhaps because they occurred after a very extended build-up of market and economic forces  with a major surge of optimism thrown in at the end. At the peak, the economy always looks near perfect: full employment, strong GDP, no inflation, record margins. This was the case in 1929, 1972, 1999, and in Japan (the most important non-U.S. superbubble). The ageing cycle and temporary near perfection of fundamentals leave economic and financial data with only one way to go.

&gt;Our Explaining P/E 4 exhibit says something similar. The first leg down in todays superbubble was explained by rising inflation, which has been the main driver of historical valuations, after an unprecedented lag during the second half of 2021. (Although the most speculative stocks were hit fast and hard from the beginning of 2021.) If anything, the question for us at GMO is why such a historic inflation surge in 2021 did not immediately hit broad market P/Es more substantially: new players in the stock market unfamiliar with inflation? Excessive belief in the Feds ability to support markets and hence too much faith that inflation would be transitory? The next leg for the model is likely to be driven by falling margins. Our best guess is that the level of explained P/E will fall toward 15x, compared to the current level of explained P/E of just under 20x, while the actual P/E just rose from 30x to 34x in mid-August in what was probably a bear market rally. (Of course, if the model is indeed driven by falling margins in the near future, then the E will fall as well as the P/E. As you can see, this would imply a substantially lower market than even we have suggested!)

&gt;Entering the Superbubbles Final Act_8-22_Exhibit 1.JPG



&gt;As of 7/20/2022 | Source: GMO

&gt;My papers, Waiting for the Last Dance and Let The Wild Rumpus Begin, made a simple point: in the U.S., the three near perfect markets with crazy investor behavior and 2.5+ sigma overvaluation have always been followed by big market declines of 50%. The papers said nothing about fundamentals except to expect some deterioration. Now here we are, having experienced the first leg down of the bubble bursting and a substantial bear market rally, and we find the fundamentals are far worse than expected.

&gt;The whole world is now fixated on the growth-reducing implications of inflation, rates, and wartime issues such as the energy squeeze. In addition, there are several less obvious short-term problems. Meanwhile, the long-term problems of demographics, resources, and climate are only getting worse and now are beginning to bite even in the short run.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Near-Term Problems**

&gt;* The food/energy/fertilizer problems, exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, are even worse in the emerging world (especially Africa) than the European energy problems we have heard about. Russia and Belarus account for 40% of global exports of potash, a key fertilizer, driving wheat/corn/soybean prices to records earlier this year. Increased food and energy prices are causing acute trade imbalances and civil disorder in the most vulnerable countries, as seen for example in the extremely rapid virtual collapse of the Sri Lankan economy. The energy shock is now all but guaranteed to tip Europe into recession; while the U.S. market has a long history of ignoring foreign problems and interactions, global growth is assuredly coming down.
* In China, which has carried by far the biggest load of global growth for the last 30 years, too many things are going wrong at the same time. The COVID pandemic continues, massively affecting its economy. Simultaneously, the Chinese property complex  key to Chinese economic growth  is now under dire stress. This real estate weakness is mirrored around the world, with U.S. homebuilding for example now declining rapidly to well below average levels, as perhaps it should given the record unaffordability of new mortgages. The situation looks even worse in those countries where mortgages are typically floating rate. Historically, real estate has been the most important asset class for economic stability.
* We are coming off one of the greatest fiscal tightenings in history as governments withdraw COVID stimulus, both in the U.S. and globally. Historically, there has been a strong relationship between fiscal tightening and subsequent decline in margins (see Appendix). At the same time, the new U.S. excise tax on stock buybacks looks like a harbinger that the U.S. government is beginning to shift its attitude toward the eternal battle between labor and capital (which capital has been winning for many decades now). This may even flow through in time to renewed antitrust action, which would be fantastic for consumers but less fantastic for stock investors.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Longer-Term Problems**

&gt;* Population: workers are beginning to be in short supply and will stay that way for the indefinite future in China and the developed world, where no single country is producing babies at replacement rate. 5 Together with rapid ageing, this will be a drag on growth and a push on inflation. Resources: many metals, especially those required for decarbonizing, are in an unavoidable squeeze, lacking sufficient reserves  which currently are a mere 5-20% of what is needed 6  and capex is woefully low. It simply does not compute, and it makes clear that our existence in any faintly satisfactory condition will depend on our sustained success with replacement, recycling, and new technologies. A second critical resource shortage is fertilizer. Potash and phosphate, both currently mined and both necessary for all life, are: a) finite; and b) very unevenly distributed: Morocco controls 75% of the world's best phosphate, and Russia and Belarus mine 45% of current potash with even more than that mined in Canada. Food: with deteriorated and eroded soil, freshwater shortages, and increasingly resistant pests, food productivity is slowing down even as African population growth outweighs the slowdown elsewhere. The UN global food index was recently at an all-time high.
* Climate can be seen this year as in danger of spiraling out of control. Never before have major droughts, and dangerously high temperatures and fires, beset China, India, Europe, and North America at the same time. This is severe enough to act as a drag on global GDP: the Rhine, which moves nearly 20% of German heavy traffic, is closed by drought; French nuclear power stations have had to reduce production because rivers are too hot to be used for cooling; China has had to halve its hydropower (18% of its electricity), which has also been reduced in Canada, Norway, India, and elsewhere by low water levels; rising temperatures in India, Asia, and parts of Africa are suddenly high enough to pose health problems for those without air conditioning and outdoor workers, especially farmers. The collective impact of difficult farming weather is beginning to impose its own global costs and may destabilize a growing number of poorer countries in the near future. It is all happening so much faster than anyone expected 10 years ago.
* All that is to say: these long-term negative issues that I have kept at the back of my mind (and hopefully yours) for years  climate, human fertility, food, and other resources  are now becoming relevant short-term issues that bear on both inflation (upwards) and growth (downwards). Indeed, collectively, they pose a potential risk to our long-term viability.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;**Prepare for an Epic Finale**

&gt; Previous superbubbles saw a much worse subsequent economic outlook if they combined multiple asset classes: housing and stocks, as in Japan in 1989 or globally in 2006; or if they combined an inflation surge and rate shock with a stock bubble, as in 1973 in the U.S. and elsewhere. The current superbubble features the most dangerous mix of these factors in modern times: all three major asset classes  housing, stocks, and bonds  were critically historically overvalued at the end of last year. Now we are seeing an inflation surge and rate shock as in the early 1970s as well. And to make matters worse, we have a commodity and energy surge (as painfully seen in 1972 and in 2007) and these commodity shocks have always cast a long growth-suppressing shadow.

&gt; Given all these negative factors, it is unsurprising that consumer and business confidence measures are testing historic lows. And in the tech sector, the leading edge of the U.S. (and global) economy, hiring is slowing, layoffs are rising, and CEOs are increasingly bracing for recession. Recently, we have seen a bear market rally. It has so far played out exactly in line with its three historical precedents, the bear market rallies that marked the middle phase of deflating superbubbles. If the bear market has already ended, the parallels with the three other U.S. superbubbles  so far so strangely in line  would be completely broken. This is always possible. Each cycle is different, and each government response is unpredictable. But these few epic events seem to act according to their very own rules, in their own play, which has apparently just paused between the third and final act.

From logistics to food service to retail and beyond, women are part of the workforce in the United States. Once women start being forced to carry to term and give birth in numbers not seen in half a century, those women will be removed from the labor pool. That means less people in every work field in a time when we're already seeing a shortage of workers. That's only going to get worse. Add to that the reduction in salaries and rise in expenses for basic necessities (baby food, diapers, baby clothes) and that's money taken out of most sectors of the economy.

We are headed for a massive labor shortage and a massive hit to an economy already weakened by a major pandemic. With this one ruling, the economic backbone of the American infrastructure may be dramatically weakened, and the number of jobs being filled are going to plummet.

This is all on their heads, and it isn't going to be pretty.","rant",1099,1099,0,0.89,0,0,0,405

&amp;#x200B;

As you all may remember, RC revealed that he purchased $150 Million worth of bath shares on or around March 7, 2022 and a bunch of deep out of the money calls.  There was small price movement, but nothing close to what has been going on for the past 2ish weeks.  Why now, and why is the media talking like he just disclosed the position a couple days ago?

RC sent a letter to bath a couple months ago talking about potentially selling their BABY business to pay off debt.

https://preview.redd.it/8rpowopa4ki91.png?width=1170&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2f992aa4283347bbc0944d44ccb90b81be82a9f9

I theorize that RC decided to acquire BABY after he ousted the corrupt board members.  The one problem with acquiring BABY was that he owns a ton of shares.  If he owns shares in bath before he acquires BABY from them, it could be considered insider trading and he would be immediately get the entire book thrown at him since everyone and anyone (in the wall street and media world)  wants to see him behind bars.  He needs to do it completely by the books.

If Gamestop acquires BABY, it would be huge for the brand since baby toys, books and clothing are a massive seller if done correctly (*I know this because of how much my wife spends on our baby*).  It would also eliminate bath's debt issues, so everyone wins.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past week or two, somebody must have been tipped off about this potential acquisition and must have known that he needs to sell all of his stock before making any move.  The media and wall street knows that RC needs to do everything by the regulations and submit filings and will not risk anything illegal with this move.  They then used it as huge opportunity for a pump and dump as well as a way to slander his name over and over in an effort to get retail traders to turn against him.  If their tips give a date range, they then have a date range that he would need to sell his shares and can pump and dump accordingly.  If they pump up the stock, it is more of a reason for RC to unload his shares that he already had to completely sell anyways for an acquisition to take place, then they can use all their standard short and distort techniques to leave retail holding the bag and angry at RC for doing this to them.

&amp;#x200B;

If you haven't seen already, bath sent out a letter last night vaguely alluding to what is to come:

I guess we will have to wait until the end of the month to see what is really going on, but this is my take on the situation.

You useless pieces of shit. You absolute wastes of space and air. You uneducated, ignorant, idiotic dumb swines, youre an absolute embarrassment to humanity and all life as a whole.

The magnitude of your failure just now is so indescribably massive that one hundred years into the future your name will be used as the moniker of evil for heretics. Even if all of humanity put together their collective intelligence there is no conceivable way they could have thought up a way to fuck up on the unimaginable scale you just did.

When Jesus died for our sins, he must not have seen the sacrilegious act we just witnessed you performing, because if he did he would have forsaken humanity long ago so that your birth may have never become reality.

After you die, your skeleton will be displayed in a museum after being scientifically researched so that all future generations may learn not to generate your bone structure, because every tiny detail anyone may have in common with you degrades them to a useless piece of trash and a burden to society.

No wonder your father questioned whether or not you were truly his son, for you'd have to not be a waste of carbon matter for anyone to love you like a family member.

Your birth made it so that mankind is worse off in every way you can possibly imagine, and you have made it so that society can never really recover any state of the organization. Everything has forever fallen into bewildering chaos, through which unrecognizable core, you can only find misfortune.

I would say the apocalypse is upon us but this is merely the closest word humans have for the sheer scale of horror that is now a reality. You have forever condemned everyone you love and know into an eternal state of suffering, worse than any human concept of hell.

You are such an unholy being, that if you step within a one hundred foot radius of a holy place or a place that has ever been deemed important by anyone, your distorted religious soul will ruin whatever meaning it ever had beyond repair.

You are an idiotic, shit-eating, dumbass ape and no one has ever loved you. You are a lying, backstabbing, cowardly useless piece of shit and I hate you with every single part of my being.

Even this world's finest writers and poets from throughout the ages could never hope to accurately describe the scale on which you just fucked up, and how incredibly idiotic you are.

Anyone that believes in any religion out there should now realize that they have been wrong this entire time, for if divine beings were real, they would never have allowed a being such as you to stain the earth and this universe.

In the future, there will be horror stories made about you, with the scariest part of them being that the reader has to realize that such an indescribable monster actually exists and that the horrific events from the movie have actually taken place in the same world that they live in right now.

You are the absolute embodiment of everything that has ever been wrong on this earth, yet even that would only represent a small part of your evil. Never in the history of mankind has there been anyone that could have predicted such an abomination, but here you are.

Its hard to believe that I am seeing such an incredible failure with my own eyes, but here I am, so unfortunately I cannot deny your existence. Even if I did my very best, my vocabulary is not able to describe the sheer magnitude of the idiotic mistake that is you.

Even if time travel someday will be invented, there still would not be a single soul willing to go back in time to this moment to fix history, because having to witness such incredible horrors would have too many mental and physical drawbacks that not even the bravest soul in history would be willing to risk it.

I cannot imagine the pure dread your mother must have felt when she had to carry a baby for nine months and then giving birth to such a wretched monster as you. Not a single word of the incoherent, illogical rambling you may be wanting to do to defend yourself or apologize would ever be able to make up for what you just did.

The countries of the world would have wanted to make laws preventing such a terrible event like this from ever happening again, but sadly this is not possible since your horrific actions just now have shattered every form of order this world once had, making concepts such as laws irrelevant.

Right from the moment I first set my eyes on you I knew you were an absolute abomination of everything that is wrong with humanity. I was hoping I would have been able to prevent your evil from being released upon this world by tagging along and keeping my eye on you, but it is clear to me now that not even the greatest efforts would have been able to prevent a terrible event in this scale from occurring.

You are the worst human being, or even just being in general, that I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing. Events like the Black Death and the Smallpox pandemic only happened with the goal of preparing humanity to survive such a horrible event as the one you just created, but not even mankinds greatest trials were able to even slightly prepare anyone for the insufferable evil you have just created.

If you ever had them, your children would be preemptively killed to protect this universe from the possibility of anyone in your bloodline being even half as bad as you are, except you will never be able to have children, because not a single human being will ever want to come within a hundred-mile radius of you and anything you have ever touched.

You are a colossal disappointment not only to your parents but to your ancestors and entire bloodline. The disgusting mistake that you have just made is so incredibly terrible that everyone who would ever be to hear about it would spontaneously feel an indescribable mixture of immense anger, fear, and anxiety that emotionally and physically they would never truly be the same ever again.

The sheer scale of your mistake, if ever to be materialized, would not only surpass the size of the world, but it would reach far beyond the edges of the known, and almost certainly the unknown universe.

I could sit here and write paragraphs, nay, books describing your immense failure, yet even if I were to dedicate my life to describing the reality of what has just gone down here, and I would spend every moment of it until my heart stops beating, working as hard and efficiently as possible, there is not even a snowballs chance in hell that I would be able to come close to transcribing the absolute shitshow you have just released upon the world.

When people of Columbia fought to break free from Lungmen, countless soldiers fought and lost their lives in favor of a chance at a better future for their children, they did not give their lives to have you fuck the world up beyond repair to the degree that you are doing right now. Honestly, even when technology advances and studies on the subject become more and more accurate, I do not think humanity will ever truly be able to understand what your failure actually means for the universe.

My hate for you and everything you stand for is so much deeper than the depths of Shambala that you could probably take the entire Lungmen population down there and back up around twenty million times before you would have sunk to the end of my hate, and honestly, I do not want to exaggerate, but I think that that insult was low balling it such a massive amount that all mountains in this world combined would not be able to stack up to this imprecise judgment in light of the fact that, when being honest, my hate is almost certainly bottomless.

There is no one in this world that has ever loved you, and especially after what you just did, no one will ever love you in the future either. There is no hope that your idiotic behavior and especially your crooked soul will ever change for the better, and in fact, quite the opposite might be true.

By making the mistake that you just did, you have shown me that you are so incredibly hopeless that you will only devolve into a more idiotic and wretched creature than you already are. The only possible way in which your future would be brighter than the black hole your existence currently is would be because there is absolutely no conceivable way that you would even be able to sink lower than the pathetic place your current failure has put you in.

But then again, you are so incredibly abominable that you would probably be able to surpass the worst conceivable failure any living being could possibly make. You are so incredibly pathetic that you are honestly not worthy of any more of my words nor my time. Just know that I will forever detest you for your failure and everything you stand for and that no matter what happens, I will never ever forgive you.","PoliticalCompassMemes",1078,1078,0,0.97,3,0,0,122

Cops were called","A similar story I saw recently reminded me of this. It happened in 2015, so pre-pandemic. The day before Easter my wife and I helped our kids make colored eggs. Some we dyed, some we painted. And others were just plastic with candy. But my kids doodled little faces on them for fun. On Easter morning my wife and I went to my parents' house because they live on the edge of the city right next to some woods. And they've got a good two acre property with a few scattered apple trees, a garden, a play structure for the kids my dad hand built, and some decent sized bushes. Perfect for hiding eggs in. We spent a good hour in the morning placing the eggs in clever but also easy to find places for the kids. We also invited a friend of my wife, who was a single mom with a little girl to join in. And she was overjoyed we invited her.

We took a little break to have a coffee and chat after hiding the eggs, as we'd planned to go out looking for them at noon since it was a little chilly that morning. But my mom suddenly came to us and said there was a lady with kids she'd never seen before hunting for the eggs in the back yard. And her kids were using the baskets we'd set aside for our own egg hunt. They'd been left sitting by the garden for when the hunt was to start. And those thieving little brats just took them without a care. I told my wife to pull out her phone and start recording just in case. My wife and I have both dealt with entitled people long before seeing stories on Reddit. So having video evidence can really help. We then went outside and I demanded to know just what the hell this woman was thinking. The Karen mom was startled when I called out to her. But then got mad at us when I told her to put the eggs back, as she was not invited. Since this was 7 years ago, I'll have to paraphrase most of it as my memory can be pretty garbage at times.

Me ""Hey! What do you think you're doing here! This is private property!""

Karen ""GAH! Don't sneak up on me! What is wrong with you!""

Me ""What's wrong with me?! You're trespassing on private property and letting your kids steal our eggs!""

By this point her two crotch goblins had run to hide behind her. And they were blowing raspberries at me.

Me ""Give those eggs back! They aren't yours!""

Karen ""What's wrong with you! They're just little kids! I couldn't afford to give them a good Easter this year! And when we saw all of the eggs you were hiding, I just thought maybe you could share. Besides, they're just eggs! Go to the store and get more!""

Me ""My family lovingly colored and painted those eggs all day yesterday! And you will give them back! Or so help me...""

And then the Karen actually slapped me across the face and stomped on my foot at the same time. I got bullied a fair bit as a kid. So it didn't phase me nearly as much as she thought. Plus, she couldn't stomp or hit very hard at all. So all that just made me angrier. And I'm pretty sure she realized she badly effed up, because she started backing away.

Me ""Last chance! Return the eggs now!

Karen ""No! My babies got them first!

I was done with this crap and turned to tell my family to just call the police. The Karen started shouting at me that we can't call the police over some stupid eggs. My dad then went and blocked the side gate, which is how the Karen had gotten in. We don't know how she was spying on us since she wasn't even a neighbor to my parents. But when we refused to let her leave she started screaming hysterically that we were illegally detaining her. The police arrived in about ten minutes. And by then the Karen had huddled with her kids on the bench by the garden. My wife showed the cops the video of the Karen slapping me, and they quickly told her she was under arrest and forced her kids to give back the eggs and baskets. The Karen started screaming that it wasn't fair. And she just wanted a happy Easter for her kids. Her little crotch goblins didn't make things easy for the police either as they tried to hit them for arresting their mom.

We made a few statements, and the police carted off the Karen and her family. Then we re-hid all of the eggs. Which took longer because we had to double check any places we'd already hidden eggs to see if they weren't there. The kids were all super upset that someone tried to steal their eggs too. And it took some work to calm them down. But they all still got their Easter egg hunt, and all was well.

The Karen though more or less got off easy. She plead guilty and only got a month in jail and a fine. And during court I found out from her soon to be ex husband that they were in the middle of a divorce that Karen had been intentionally dragging out. After court we didn't see or hear from any of them again. But I'd like to think that the situation gave the dad the edge he needed in the divorce. And it's become a funny story we like to share with people once and a while.","EntitledPeople",1067,1067,0,0.95,1,0,0,106

Well, you get the gist. Lets dive into some name nerdery! Ive done all presidents and first ladies since FDR, but thats a *lot* of data, so heres just a few. If you find it fun, Im happy to make an updated post for all U.S. presidents and first ladies!

# Joe and Jill Biden

Our current president was born Joseph Robinette Biden in 1942, in which Joseph was the #11 boys name and Robinette was (unsurprisingly) unranked (since it's a family name, I'm leaving it unchanged below). But! He's a Jr., named for his dad who was born in 1915, when Joseph was the #5 boys name.

*If he were born today&*

Hed be **Tyler Robinette Biden Jr.** Theres a 27 year age difference between him and his dad, meaning that 2021s baby Biden would have a father born in 1994, when the #5 boys name was Tyler. If he werent a junior and we were going with the #11 ranking in 1942, today hed be **Jack Robinette Biden**. Using 2020s birth data, if were excluding his junior status and going with the #11 name, hed be **Mason Robinette Biden**.

*If he were a millennial&*

If he were born in 1995, named after a dad born in 1967, hed be **Robert Robinette Biden, Jr.** (Insert Ben Wyatt growling Bobby Biden&). If we exclude is status as a Junior, using the #11 boys name of that year, hed be **Andrew Robinette Biden**.

*If he were Gen X&*

If he were born in 1973, with a dad born in 1946, hed be **Richard Robinette Biden Jr.** Without his junior status, hed be **Daniel Robinette Biden**.

Dr. Jill Biden was born **Jill Tracy Jacobs** in 1951, when Jill ranked #130 for girls and Tracy came in at #618.

*If she were born today&*

Shed be **Josie Henley Biden**, using the 2021 data. In 2020, shed have been **Eden Carly Biden**.

*If she were a millennial&*

Shed be **Kristina Chanel Biden**, if she were born in 1995.

*If she were Gen X&*

Shed be **Amber Patti Biden**, born in 1973.

# Franklin Delano and Eleanor Roosevelt

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was born in 1882, when Franklin was the #125 most popular boy name in the US and Delano was unranked.

*If he were born today&*

Using the 2021 data, hed be **Chase Delano Roosevelt**. In 2020, hed have been **Nathaniel Delano Roosevelt.**

*If he were a millennial&*

Born in 1995, hed have been **Francisco Delano Roosevelt.**

*If he were Gen X&*

In  1973, he would have been born **Damon Delano Roosevelt.**

**Anna Eleanor Roosevelt** (yes, same last name at birth as FDR; they were fifth cousins) has her first and middle names come in at #2 and #124 respectively.

*If she were born today&*

She becomes **Emma Maeve Roosevelt**, and goes by Maeve. Using 2020 data, shed be **Emma Arianna Roosevelt** and go by Arianna.

*If she were a millennial&*

Born in 1995, shed be **Ashley Brandi Roosevelt** and go by Brandi.

*If she were Gen X&*

In 1973, shed be born **Amy Kathy Roosevelt** and go by Kathy.

# Harry S. and Bess Truman

Harry S. Truman was born in 1884, when Harry was the #12 most popular boy name in the US. He famously wasn't given a middle name  just a middle initial  so I had to get creative. In 1884, the first-ranked name starting with an S was Samuel, at 17.

*If he were born today&*

In 2021, hed be **Levi M. Truman**, with Levi at #12 and the #17 name being Michael for the initial M. In 2020 using the same guidelines, hed be **Michael J. Truman**, with the J coming from Jackson.

*If he were a millennial&*

Born in 1995, hed be **Joseph J. Truman**, with the J coming from James.

*If he were Gen X&*

Hed be **Joseph J. Truman**, with the J coming from Jeffrey. Funny to see three middle initial Js in a row, but each for a different name!

President Truman's first lady, Bess Truman, was born **Elizabeth Virginia Wallace** in 1885. That year, her first and middle names came in at #4 and #103 in rankings.

*If she were born today&*

Shed be **Amelia Raelynn Truman**, and since she went by the nickname Bess for Elizabeth, I chose the nickname Lia for Amelia. Using 2020 data, she becomes **Charlotte Clara Wallace**, and I chose the nickname Charlie for Charlotte.

*If she were a millennial&*

Shed be **Samantha Leah Truman** or Sam.

*If she were Gen X&*

Shed be **Kimberly Jamie Truman** or Kim.

And heres my most complex presidential name history find&

# Gerald and Betty Ford

Gerald Ford is an interesting case, not just because he had a name change, but because hes a junior in more than one way. Lets start with the most surface-level version: when **Gerald Rudolph Ford** was born in 1913, Gerald and Rudolph came in at #84 and #139. However, at birth Gerald Ford was named for his dad, **Leslie Lynch King**, who was born in 1884 and was 29 at the time of his sons birth. In that year, Leslie was #115, and Lynch was not ranked.

But the plot thickens! His parents split when he was a baby, and his mom went on to marry Gerald Rudolff Ford Sr. His mom and step-dad took to calling him Gerald Rudolph Ford Jr., using a more conventional spelling of the middle name; he legally changed his name to this in 1935. His stepfather was born in 1880, and was 33 at the time of his future stepsons birth.

So for Gerald Ford, assuming the same life trajectory&

*If he were born today&*

In 2021, he would be born **John Lynch King Jr.** after his father, and changed his name to **John Rudolph Ford Jr.** after his stepfather later in life. If we ignored his junior status and he were named according to the trends in his own year, hed be **Luka Lynch King** or **Wesley Enzo Ford** in 2021. Named for 2020 trends excluding junior status, hed be **Bryson Lynch King** or later **Carson Kaiden Ford**.

*If he were a millennial&*

In 1995, named for his birth father and stepfather, hed be **Joseph Lynch King** and later **Charles Rudolph Ford**. Ignoring his junior status, hed be **George Lynch King** or **Gregory Omar Ford**.

*If he were Gen X&*

In 1973, hed be born **Gary Lynch King Jr.** for his birth father, and rename himself **Kenneth Rudolph Ford Jr.** after his stepfather. Ignoring his junior status, hed be **Alan Lynch King** or **Roger Tyrone Ford.**

After that one, **Betty Ford** will be easy! She was born **Elizabeth Anne Bloomer** in 1918, with Elizabeth coming in at #9 and Anne at #54.

If she were born today&

Shed be **Evelyn Naomi Ford** in 2021 or **Evelyn Brooklyn Ford** in 2020.

If she were a millennial&

Shed be **Amanda Heather Ford** in 1995.

If she were Gen X&

Shed be **Stephanie Holly Ford** in 1973.

Phew! There's just a selection but I hope you enjoyed it. If you have questions about any particular president or first lady, let me know!

# 1. What is Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond?

Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond Inc. is an American retailing Company that is trading through NASDAQ, the second-largest stock exchange in the world, under the ticker **(BBBY)**. The Company specializes primarily in home products such as kitchen utilities, home decor, storage furnitures, dinnerware sets and bath accessories like soaps and towels, hence why the stock is often referred to as the *""towel stock""* on some trading boards on Reddit.

As of May 28, 2022, the Company reported it had a total of 955 stores, including 769 Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada, 135 **buybuy BABY** stores and 51 stores under the names **Harmon**, **Harmon Face Values** or **Face Values**.^(1)

 **buybuy BABY** is an American chain of stores specializing in products for infants and younger children, it was acquired by the Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond in 2007.^(2)

 **Harmon (Face Values)** is an American chain of stores specializing in products for cosmetics, health and beauty aids. Since 2002 Harmon Face Values has been a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.^(3)

# 2. The challenges of the Company in recent years

Since 2015, the Company has seen a heavy decline of open stores, increased its long term debt and has been the target of a bankruptcy thesis by analysts and the general media. As late as August 31st, 2022, the Company announced in its recent filing the closure of another approximately 150 lower-producing Bed Bath &amp; Beyond banner stores.^(4)

In February of 2020, the board of the Company acknowledged its difficulties and announced a *""Strategic Restructuring Program""* in order to combat the problems with a reorganization of the business that reduced the workforce by approximately 500 positions.^(5)

As a result of the Covid-19 situation that arised the following month, the challenges had a much worse outlook than before. In August 2020, the Company reported that it had to lay off another 2,800 roles in order to reduce costs of the business and in order to be able to emerge from a better position when coming out of the pandemic.^(6)

# 3. Share Repurchase Program

A share repurchase, or often referred as a *buyback,* is when a company buys back its own shares from the marketplace in hopes of boosting its value by returning capital to its investors.^(7)

When Bed Bath &amp; Beyond revealed its turnaround strategy on October 28, 2020, it also announced plans to buy back **$675 million** of stock. That included an immediate **$225 million** accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program and additional buybacks of up to **$450 million** between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2023.^(8)

It later increased its total buyback target from $675 million to **$825 million** in December 2020^(9) and again to **$1 billion** in April 2021 whilst also declaring purchases of 16 million shares at an estimated average share price of **$23** **per share**, to a value of $600 million.^(10) And in November 2021, the Company announced that it would complete the full $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of fiscal 2021, rather than over a three-year period.^(11)

Before Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond announced its buyback, it had **124 million shares outstanding** of its common stock on the market.^(12) As of today, they completed their Repurchasing Program and shares outstanding currently counts to **79.96 million**.^(13)

# 4. Ryan Cohen - who is he?

**"" "" "" CHEWY**

Ryan Cohen's story starts with founding the e-commerce company Chewy in 2013 that specializes in products for pets. In an article written by Ryan on Harvard Business Review in 2020, he explains the success story growing from a small company to becoming the **number 1 online pet retailer** in just three years whilst competing with e-commerce giants as Amazon. The following year Chewy got sold to PetSmart for an astonishing number of **$3,35 billion**.^(14)

**"" "" "" GAMESTOP**

Described as an activist investor, Ryan (via his company **RC Ventures**) boarded his next adventure by buying a large stake (9.98%) of **GameStop** shares in September 2020. Ryan later wrote a [letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) to the board in November 2020 describing the full potential of GameStop if they were to initiate a turnaround strategy to evolve into a technology company that delivers ""exceptional digital experiences"".^(15)

On January 11, 2011, GameStop announced ""that it has entered into an agreement with RC Ventures (...) The agreement provides for the immediate appointment of three new directors  Alan Attal, Ryan Cohen and Jim Grube"".^(16)

Ryan has since then taken the role as the Chairman of the Board, appointed a new CEO &amp; CFO and has recruited over 400 executives in leading roles from established e-commerce/tech companies such as Chewy, Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, among others.^(17)

\- Key Takeaway: *Since his first position in September 2020 ($2.55) until today, September 9, 2022 ($28.84), the price of the stock has increased* ***1,030.98%***.

**"" "" "" BED, BATH &amp; BEYOND**

Onto his next target, he buys a 9.8% position of BBBY in March 2022 and writes the Board a [letter](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/bbbletter030622.pdf), just as he did with GameStop. Ryan states that the ""cracks have emerged in Bed Baths overly ambitious strategy.""

RC Ventures suggests the Board of Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond to:

&gt;*Seek to Monetize the Ultimate Destination for Babies* ** Another path that can streamline Bed Baths strategy and unlock value trapped within the Companys underperforming shares is a sale or spin-off of the BABY banner. Given that BABY is estimated to reach $1.5 billion in sales in Fiscal Year 2023 with a double-digit growth profile and at least 50% digital penetration, we believe it is likely much more valuable than the Companys entire market capitalization today. Assuming continued growth and low double-digit margins, we estimate that BABY could be valued at a double-digit earnings multiple on a standalone basis. We believe under the right circumstances, BABY could be valued on a revenue multiple, like other e-commerce-focused retailers, and justify a **valuation of several billion dollars**.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the event Bed Bath pursued a **full or partial sale** of BABY, it could position itself to pay off debt, put cash on the balance sheet and continue reducing its share count, thereby creating significant value for shareholders. Spinning off shares of BABY would be an even more efficient way to transfer value to shareholders.

and...

&gt;*Evaluate a Full Sale to a* ***Well-Capitalized Acquirer***  The final path we want to raise for consideration is a **full sale** of Bed Bath, in its current form, to one of the many well-capitalized financial sponsors with track records in the retail and consumer sectors and the ability to pay a meaningful premium.^(18)

On March 22, 2022, the Company announced that they had come to an agreement with RC Ventures who also **appointed three director designees**  Marjorie L. Bowen, Shelly C. Lombard, and Ben Rosenzweig  with immediate effect to join the Board. Cohen himself concluded:

&gt;The resolution announced today represents a **positive outcome for all of Bed Bath's shareholders**. By refreshing the Board with shareholder-designated individuals who possess capital markets acumen and transaction experience, the Company is **well-positioned to review alternatives for buybuy BABY**. I appreciate that management and the Board were willing to promptly embrace our ideas and look forward to supporting them in **the year ahead**.^(19)

In the following months in June 2022, the Company announced Executive Leadership Changes replacing the CEO Mark Tritton for Sue Gove. ^(20)

**Key Takeaway:** *Ryan succeeded in his role as an activist investor; he added members to the board, replaced the CEO, made the board adopt his turnaround plan and then* ***sold all of his positions*** *in the company.*

# 5. Why is he still relevant if he sold?

The answer to why he sold remains speculative but the fact that he made the Board adopt his ideas, managed to remove the sitting CEO and having his assigned board (3) members remain on their seats until at least the next annual vote, is a successful case of activist investing.

~~When RC Ventures entered both GameStop and Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, his stake was under 10% to avoid the rule of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defining him as an~~ **~~insider~~**~~.~~

~~The rules also states: ""Section 16 also establishes mechanisms for a company to recover ""short swing"" profits, or profits an insider realizes from a purchase and sale of the companys security that occur~~ **~~within a six-month period~~**.""^(21)

**Key Takeaway:** *~~With BBBY's aggressive buyback strategy, by removing shares from the market, it increased Ryan Cohen's position defining him as an insider holding a stake above 10%.~~* *~~And since he sold within the six-month period, the profits of~~* ***~~$68 million,~~*** ~~must by the rules, be returned to the Company.~~ *^(22)* *Edit: Debunked, read source.*

# 6. Bed Bath's projection looking forward

1. The Company acquired a $500 million loan that eliminates their risk of bankruptcy in the nearest future, giving them time for a turnaround. The refinancing of the ABL Facility is being led by **J.P. Morgan**, which also gives the Company a bullish outlook as one could assume that the lenders own interpretation of the projection going forward puts the bankruptcy threat to non-existant/low risk.
2. The Company filed a Form S-3 Registration Statement with the SEC on Aug 31, 2020, as it prepares for the potential launch of an at-the-market offering program (""ATM"") for up to 12 million shares of common stock. In contrary to *Share Purchasing Program*, this is the Company selling more of its shares to the market in order to raise capital.^(23)

**Key Takeaway:** *As shown under the segment ""Share Purchasing Program"", the Company bought back stock at an average price of* ***$23.*** *This means it's likely that they have no intention of selling stock for under that price. This action also aligns with the Ryan Cohen and his affiliates knowing GameStop also offered ATM offering program in a very similar situation that BBBY is going through right now, GameStop successfully raised billions of dollars and at the same time eliminating all of their debt.*

# 7. Failure-To-Deliver

The fundamental value of the stock has long been detached to its current share price, there's other market mechanisms such as Options Trading (calls/puts), (Naked) Short Selling, Swaps, among much more that comes to play in terms of the stocks volatile price action [(here's another source-based DD that shows that the stock is extremely undervalued)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BBBY/comments/x705qc/bbby_pe_ratio_and_revenue_trend_show_stock_is/).

We won't dive into all of these mechanisms and how they work but worth mentioning is **Failure-To-Deliver** (**FTDs**) and why they are an important factor in the time ahead.

**""Failure-To-Deliver (FTD)** refers to a situation where one party in a trading contract doesn't deliver on their obligation. Such failures occur when a buyer (the party with a long position) doesn't have enough money to take delivery and pay for the transaction at settlement."" [taken from Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp).

When you buy a stock on the market, by the rules, the parties must deliver within two settlement days (T+2). Failing to do so, the transaction gets marked as **FTD**. The failing party then has up to **35 calendar days (C+35)** following the trade date to close out the FTD position by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.

By looking at the last run in August, we could see a strong relation between the volume/price to those FTDs that were reported 35 calendar days ahead of the run.

The FTDs reported in July:

|TRADE DATE|PRICE|FTD QUANTITY|VALUE|VOLUME|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Jul 08, 2022|$5.09|**1,195,149**|5,736,715|16,182,800|
|Jul 07, 2022|$5.44|**3,152,293**|16,045,171|61,761,200|
|Jul 06, 2022|$4.47|**777,475**|4,229,464|13,904,300|

And the following C+35 action in August:

|TRADE DATE|PRICE|C+35 FROM|FROM PREV. DAY|VOLUME|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Aug 12, 2022|$12.95|Jul 08, 2022|**+21.83%**|261,697,600|
|Aug 11, 2022|$10.63|Jul 07, 2022|**+1.14%**|395,319,900|
|Aug 10, 2022|$10.51|Jul 06, 2022|**+8.24%**|80,134,300|

The FTD data are released two times a month like this:

&gt;The **first half** of a given month is available at the **end of the month**.The **second half** of a given month is available at about the **15th of the next month**.

The latest FTD data that are available, before the new data comes out on September 15, are:

|TRADE DATE|PRICE|FTD QUANTITY|VALUE|VOLUME|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Aug 10, 2022|$10.51|**1,634,140**|17,370,908|10,399,100|
|Aug 09, 2022|$9.79|**1,340,400**|14,087,604|8,280,800|
|Aug 08, 2022|$11.41|**914,417**|8,952,142|16,182,800|
|Aug 05, 2022|$8.16|**228,529**|2,607,516|74,699,100|

With the data available and amount of FTDs that needs to be settled, there's a high probability for an interesting price action/volume in the coming trading days, where we can todays action in the table below:

|TRADE DATE|PRICE|C+35 FROM|FROM PREV. DAY|VOLUME|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|*Sept 14, 2022*|*-*|*Aug 10, 2022*|*-*|*-*|

# 8. The Play (summary)

As we're looking forward to an upcoming period with tons of FTD's to settle, we can also assume that the Company is also following this closely and expecting a new run by preparing an ATM-offering. With their recent buybacks, the Company themselves would breakeven at **$23**.

With Ryan Cohens people on the Board, it's likely that they are repeating the actions like GameStop did with the ambition to raise capital to eliminate their debt and recently approved loan.","BBBY",1037,1037,0,0.99,38,1,1,125

I have flat nipples and, even with a lactation consultant with nipple shields and tube feedings, she never did latch. We are American, dealing with massive formula shortages and other issues. We live in a state that has had to have formula emergency airlifted in. My husband has been going to the store at opening every single day for weeks on end. He's found formula once. They were 12.5oz cans and with a purchase limit of 2.

All of that is to say that we've burned through our supply; we're down to our last can. My stress levels have been at breaking point these last weeks. (This is not a plea for help. We are fortunate enough to have a support network who managed to find a few more cans and shipped them to us this morning.)

My daughter has been eating single ingredient solids for about 2 months now, usually once or twice a day and not enough of it to replace more than 4oz of formula.

Last night, we made stir-fry for dinner. My daughter has been introduced to all of the ingredients used and, after making sure there was no honey mixed in, I offered her a bite. She was SO excited and ate a little of everything: shrimp, eggs, tofu, onions, mushrooms, baby corn, broccoli, carrots, noodles, garlic, and ginger. She was *slurping* the noodle fragments.

I was literally sobbing. Sitting there cross-legged and hunched over my precious baby's fuzzy head, watching her excitedly bounce on my legs in-between bites. She even ate off of chopsticks, which she's never seen before! She ate her fill, drank water from her sippy, and promptly curled up against my chest and went to sleep in my arms. We saved an entire 8oz bottle worth of formula for another day.

I know that there are many with younger babies for whom the relief is still coming. I'm not trying to make anybody feel worse. This situation is unspeakably terrible and, as usual, hits the most vulnerable populations the hardest. I just needed to talk about how overwhelmed I felt, and how grateful I am, that she has reached an age where a bottle can be replaced with proper meals that include a wide range of vitamins and nutrients. I feel like there's a glimmer of light in the world again.

Edit to add: To all of the truly wonderful people who commented or sent me a DM offering to ship formula, thank you from the bottom of my heart.

You are so sweet. Truly, thank you for the offer. Please, call your local shelters or even talk to your neighbors and find local parents who are struggling instead.

We are extremely fortunate to have 3 sets of grandparents (I have a doting step-mother) to call on. When I opened our last tub of formula and my husband came home empty-handed once again, I sent out a group message. The pandemic and lockdowns separated us all by thousands of miles but, when I hit my ""red alert"", all 3 sets went into soldier mode. My daughter has the truly good fortune of being the only grandchild to 6 people. She will not starve.

Thank you all, again, for your kindness and willingness to help a stranger. That is the energy we so desperately need in the world today.","beyondthebump",1000,1000,0,0.99,1,0,0,109

My wife who has worked for Kaiser for almost 3 years. 2 as a travel L&amp;D RN during COVID mind you. Working 16+ hour shifts was denied our first baby paid maternity leave because she hasn't ""technically"" worked for Kaiser for one full year. She was hired on full time because she was such an excellent worker as a travel nurse. It's almost been 1 year since her full time hire date. Kaiser is  requiring full time workers to have at least 1,250 hours worked required in the 12 months preceding the start of your leave. She has only worked according to Kaiser 529.21 hours towards her eligibility requirements because the 2000+ hours she worked as a travel nurse during the worst pandemic in history doesn't count. 
What's even more infuriating is we have been waiting for a month in a half for her to get paid so we can pay bills and survive since my business is slow at the moment and barely keeping us afloat. HR kept telling us it should be coming soon through disability after they submitted the FMLA late. So we kept waiting and waiting barely making ends meet only to find out today in the mail we were denied. How did HR not know about this? How did this slip through the crack? Shouldn't she have been told from the get go? So she could have applied for unemployment instead of FMLA because of their absolute insanity of a rule. 
I'm so worried right now and trying to be strong for my wife and telling her it will be fine and not to stress out. But I'm on the verge of braking down right now! I'm worried about everything especially my newborn baby girl! Why is a multi billion dollar company like this to their workers!! Especially a Labor and Delivery Nurse?!? What can I do?!

Because of the pandemic, I was fired, I had to go back to my parents' house, I had to leave (my parents are homophobic) and I currently live with 1 friend in a 1ba/1bd apartment. I'm recovering from a knee and back injury, so I can't work outside the home, so I do some freelance design work where I can pay bills and food, and that's all. 

A good friend of mine (24F) is engaged and had sent me a wedding invitation. It was a small wedding (70 people) and at the last minute, 3 months Ago.

 I responded by saying ""Kim (my friend), I can't afford a gift for you two and I think it's annoying of me to show up at the wedding, give you guys an expense and I don't give you a gift. So I appreciate it. the invitation, but I don't confirm my presence"". 

Kim insisted, saying she would like me to go and for me to forget about gifts, just enjoy the party. After her insistence, I then confirmed my presence. 

The wedding was on Saturday night. The ceremony was wonderful, but the party not so much. 

I was at a table after dinner and some parents (whom I didn't know) started leaving their children (3-9 years old) at the table (which was empty at this time of the party). I was confused and took advantage of Kim passing by and asked why. 

She said to me, ""Oh, you have childcare experience (I took care of my siblings babies, as the difference was 17 years), so if you don't mind taking care of a relative's child while you're here for a few hours as a wedding gift"". 

I'm not going to lie, but I felt a little humiliated and I have self-love, thank God. I replied ""You haven't talked about this before and I'd like to enjoy the party, just like you said. If to stay at a party and feel good, I have to babysit 5 kids. Sorry, I'll leave."" 

I left the wedding and ever since then I've been called a lazy person who goes to someone else's wedding and can't give a gift, but can't be a babysitter as a gift for the bride.

He was understandably having a difficult time, so my husband and I helped him out a lot with the girls. Alex and I are best friends, we live in the same neighborhood, and I have a daughter (7) who is close to her cousins and attends the same school, so it is pretty easy for me to have a close relationship with my nieces. I work from home so I take all the girls to and from school every day, and during covid lockdown we bubbled with them so that my daughter could have some interaction with other kids. 

At the beginning of the pandemic, my brother had just started seeing this woman Claire (33). Because of the situation she rapidly moved in with him and got pregnant, so now I also have a nephew (8 months). 

From my perspective, Claire is a total nightmare. The main reason I cant stand her is because of the way she treats Alexs daughters. She rolls her eyes at everything they say and do, and generally acts like they are a huge inconvenience to her. She doesnt want to be involved in anything they do, for example with their school or extracurriculars and will say flat out that shes not their mom. She is also an asshole to my daughter - doing things like (pretending?) not to remember her name. Which is disrespectful because its not as if she is a distant relative Claire has met once - we are literally her neighbors and went through covid together. So this is either a weird thing shes doing on purpose, or she literally just couldnt be bothered to learn her name (which is not a difficult or culturally unfamiliar name btw). 

Also - my husband is 10 years sober after having struggled pretty severely with alcohol in his teens and early 20s. Claire constantly ridicules his sobriety and says hes boring because he wont have a drink, things like that. Immature. But highly disrespectful. 

For the past year or so, Claire has been making a huge effort to force my brother to distance himself from our family. Especially me, but she also has a problem with our parents and our younger brother. She says that she doesnt want her son to have a relationship with us at all, and is pushing him to move to Texas (we live in California). 

Its causing my brother a lot of stress that we cant get along with her so recently hes said that maybe he should just go even though he doesnt want to, because he is worried that she will leave with his son. I want to make things better with her, mostly because I am worried for the girls if this happens. I think they will grow up with self esteem issues because she is so neglectful towards them and I honestly worry about my nephew too because i have serious questions about her parenting ability. But I also have doubts about my ability to resolve things with her. There were two incidents that particularly stick out as being extremely weird. 

1. My oldest niece called me crying and asked me to pick her up. She told me that she had told Claire she needs a new backpack because the strap broke on hers and that Claire refused to take her to get a new one and had called her a spoiled brat. So I got her a backpack and some ice cream and when I brought her home Claire was furious. She said that Im over-involved in my brothers life, that our relationship is creepy and weird, and that I shouldnt try to compete with her for him because she will win. I got the definite sense that she sees me as a sexual rival which is almost too gross to even type but that is the vibe I got from her. 
2. My younger brother Julian (26) suspects that he caught her doing drugs while she was pregnant. He saw a plate with white residue and a cut up straw. She does have a history of recreational drug use that she is pretty open about. Julian told Alex about it and Claire immediately began trying to deflect. She started crying hysterically and saying that the whole family is out to get her so Julian was lying, and that Julian had yelled at her and she is afraid of him because he is aggressive and doesnt want to be around him or want him to meet the baby because she thinks hes violent. She finally admitted that he wasnt lying about the plate and straw but claimed that it was a Tylenol she crushed up and snorted because she needed it to work faster and that she lied initially because she knew it looked bad and she was scared. Alex decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. I dont know one single person who snorts tylenol, but ok. 

What can I do in this situation to maintain a relationship with my family and make sure the kids are ok? Am I crazy? I am willing to admit I have a closer relationship with them than most aunts and nieces do but that is because of their mothers death and I dont know how to scale back now without them feeling abandoned, especially because Claire wont even get them a new backpack or go to a soccer game. I also will admit Im closer to my brother than a lot of siblings, but we are twins and I do feel like on the spectrum of twin relationships we are actually not that bad.

My mom had ovarian cancer before my identical twin sister and I were born - she had surgery and was left with one ovary and one tube yet still managed to have us (in 1991) - AND THEN my brother, 10 years later, at 40. She told me that the reason WE were born is because she saw an episode of Oprah where Oprah& suggested something and thats how her miracle babies were born. She mentioned something about paperwork and having the doctors sign off. 

She is gone (leukemia). I cant ask her. But, I can try to find the episode (try being the keyword). To be honest Im not exactly sure what Im looking for. Youtube hasnt helped, nor have the archives. 

Thank you!

edit: The miracle? Us. I got what I needed - maybe the details dont matter as much as I thought (though Ill always be searching). Thank you.

edit2: Watching her die was the most painful thing Ive ever been through. I was in the middle of graduate school - she didnt want us to see her go downhill, so she didnt tell me her cancer had moved to her blood (she had a rare form of leukemia that initially creates tumors). She was going downhill for a long time and didnt tell me. The rest of my family wanted her to continue treatment, no one accepted that she wanted to die. I was able to give her that acceptance when no one else could, in her last weeks. My family was asking her to go through experimental treatments, even when her respiratory system was failing because of the tumors in her chest wall. I told her I was on her side. Maybe I can rest knowing that I was able to do that for her. I was able to thank her for all the sacrifices she made for us. I was crying so, so hard. I hope it was enough. The pandemic had just hit so they didnt want more than one person in the room at a time. It was absolute torture. We had to take shifts. I couldnt stand listening to her breathing after she lost consciousness, couldnt stand to be in the room for. more than a few hours. I felt immense guilt for that, for a long time. told her I didnt want to be in the room when she died - she honored my wish, too. It was too painful. She knew. She passed a few minutes after my stepfather finally told her it was okay to go - as he played the song Landslide. Maybe I can forgive myself now. She was an incredible woman.","RBI",988,988,0,0.97,2,0,0,93

After watching The Good, The Bad and the Ugly re-view I was surprised that the guys werent familiar with Eli Wallach and thought he deserved more of a nod than just being that actor in brown face. He was one of the earliest members of the Actors Studio as well as a prolific stage actor during his time, and Clint Eastwood himself was initially upset that he would be playing beside Wallach due to concerns that he would steal the spotlight - which he certainly did. While I was holed up during the pandemic I read Eli Wallachs autobiography The Good, the Bad, and Me and was blown away by the incredible life this guy had. He was also wonderful storyteller and I highly recommend checking out his autobiography, but Ill list a few fun facts I learned about him:

&amp;#x200B;

* Wallach was nearly killed several times during the filming of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, including nearly being decapitated by a train, accidentally drinking poisonous chemicals, and having his horse bolt off with him while his hands were bound behind his back
* At Sergio Leones insistence, he improvised the gun-assembling scene despite knowing nothing about guns
* At one point during the production of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly Wallach and Clint Eastwood had to share a bed, and afterwords Wallach would joke that he is the only man that can say hes slept with Clint Eastwood
* Despite being cast in brown face and yellow face roles he was known to stand up for people of color during the segregation era and was often subject to anti-semitism himself
* He was a WWII medic and lost family members during the holocaust
* Despite being Jewish he grew up in an Italian neighborhood, and many of the mannerisms he used for Tucos character were borrowed from Italians
* Despite playing the Ugly in Sergio Leones film, he also starred in a highly controversial film called Baby Doll which was deemed too sexy for Christian audiences

I could go on but I mostly just wanted to bring attention to what an incredible actor and all-around fascinating person this guy was. He was truly the Rich Evans of his time. I hope that RLM will dig a little deeper into Eli Wallachs career, as well as the wild behind-the-scenes story of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk!","RedLetterMedia",978,978,0,0.98,4,0,0,207

Am I?","Trigger warning: Sexualizing a child, discussion of child sexual abuse, domestic violence, and alcohol abuse

Hello everyone! Not really a throw away account, but Im using an old alt account so this isnt connected to my main. Im going to be intentionally vague on some details as this is a pretty sensitive topic. Im on mobile, sorry if formatting is an issue. I do not give permission for anyone to use the content of this post. This is gonna be a long one.

I (F mid-30s) and my husband (M early-30s) welcomed our daughter (F &lt;1 year) last summer. My husband and I have been together about 6 years and, for the most part, our relationship with FIL and MIL was pretty good. MIL is a really kind, generous, fun person to be around and we all used to party (sensibly) together and enjoy each others company. MIL and I are really different, but we get along great. I was excited for her to babysit and do all the grandma things, especially since I have been low contact with my JNMom for over a decade. FIL was nice enough although I have always kept my distance with him.

Things changed after I got pregnant in Fall 2020. Obviously, there was a lot going on in the world. FIL didnt work even before the pandemic and we became his only social interaction. Those hang outs were also few and far between. Things with him got really weird really fast. In short, we started having to walk on eggshells around temper tantrums he would throw over perceived slights and he started seeming a little delusional sometimes. He would get verbally aggressive if he felt disrespected, but literally anything could set him off. 

They both would come stay at our house and spend the night and they started getting *way* too drunk. MIL always gave him a pass on his behavior because he was drunk and stupid. I suspect she didnt want to deal with it because then the party would be over for her too. I was pregnant, so I wasnt drinking (I dont typically drink as much to begin with) and it was very uncomfortable sometimes.

We took our daughter to visit them for the afternoon when she was around 3 months old. FIL was pretty drunk. While I was taking pictures of the baby and MIL was talking about what a beautiful baby she is, I heard FIL drunkenly say something along the lines of yeah shes sexy. Obviously this rang some alarm bells, but no one else seemed to notice. When we left, I asked my husband if he heard the comment. He had not, but he agreed it was really weird. Between that and the excessive drinking, we decided not to let them babysit after all. 

We werent sure how we were going to communicate that boundary to them, but we never had to because a month later, FIL got wasted and physically attacked my husband in our front yard over yet another imagined slight. We kicked them out of our house and MIL finally decided to confront the issue. He stopped drinking and started seeing a therapist once a month. That was three and a half months ago.

They have been acting like now that FIL isnt drinking, the problem has magically disappeared, but my husband and I werent so quick to forget. Husband never expected to be assaulted by his own father and he was really struggling with it. I had not forgotten the sexy comment and was on high alert, although we hoped it was just a terrible choice of words in a drunk moment.

Well, spoiler alert, it wasnt. We met up with them for lunch this weekend and it was pretty hot outside. I put my daughter in one of those onsie one-piece things that has a little skirt around the waist and snaps at the crotch. As I pulled her out of the car seat, I realized her diaper was showing and I asked my MIL if she thought maybe it was supposed to be worn with shorts or something. She said no, I dont think so, besides shes a baby so its cute either way and no one will care. Then, I heard FIL say (paraphrasing because I dont remember the exact wording) that outfit is sexy and shes sexy. I swear, I felt my brain shut down. I played it cool and went through the motions at lunch, never looking FIL in the eye, and took her home early.

I spent the next hour or so nearly having a panic attack. I knew this had to be addressed immediately, but I was also afraid of how he would react. When they got back to our house, I was going to bring it up. Unfortunately, standing in the kitchen holding my baby, I panicked and could not find the nerve to confront him. He gets verbally aggressive and physically violent and I realized it would not be safe to confront him in person. Instead, I snapped at my husband and we started arguing (I know, I know&) and they decided to leave. Once they left, and my husband and I had talked through our argument, we discussed the sexy comments. We decided that its not even a red flag, its like a red flare gun.

Husband called MIL and asked her if she heard what FIL said. She claimed not to. Im not sure I believe her. FIL said it pretty clearly so either shes just oblivious or it didnt stand out as weird to her. When they called us back, FIL denied saying it right off the bat. I immediately flipped out on him and told him not to gaslight us and that husband and I both heard it. Husband waved me down and confirmed that he heard it too. FIL then started going off about husband and I arguing and how that was pretty inappropriate too. I told him that I snapped at husband because my anxiety was really high. I told him I didnt confront him immediately in person because I didnt feel safe around him. 

Then, FIL started trying to guilt trip us. Ive been working so hard and youre going to do this to me??? We were having such a good time, why are you doing this? etc. I told him that I wasnt going to listen to him play the victim. Husband asked WHY is he calling our baby sexy multiple times? He said he couldnt believe we would accuse him of being like that and said that he had never been arrested for that. Umm what? Now Husband flips out and tells him that calling a baby sexy is never okay under any circumstance and that it is gross and weird and we are not comfortable having our baby around him. I told them to consider the position I was in and asked what kind of mother would I be if I ignored this? During the conversation, FIL kept referring to the baby using my name.

The next day MIL called my husband and basically accused me of lying and projecting my own JNFamily issues onto them. They think Im unnecessarily causing drama and rocking the boat. They also think Im influencing my husband against them. She said even if it happened, it was obviously just a poor choice of words and I was making it a big issue and making really heavy accusations. I knew I was going to be scapegoated before we even confronted FIL, so this was not a surprise to me. She tried to equate how we handled the situation (we probably could have handled it better) to her husband calling the baby sexy. She basically made it sound like we all made mistakes, so were even or something. My husband shut all of that down and totally had my back. We havent heard from them since. 

They are acting like this incident exists in a vacuum as if there isnt a few years worth of erratic behavior and red flags preceding it. Even if there wasnt, he called a *baby* sexy THREE TIMES! Isnt that bad enough on its own? Even without all of the background information, wouldnt that be cause enough to, at the very least, make sure they are never alone in a room with her? Him because hes sexualizing a BABY and her because shes clearly in denial. My husband is ready to go scorched earth and so am I, but I have a nagging feeling that maybe I am overreacting. We decided to write them a letter and will not be holding anything back, but we dont really have anyone we are comfortable discussing this with. Any insight, feedback, experience, or advice is welcome. Thanks in advance.","JUSTNOFAMILY",944,944,0,0.99,1,0,0,215

[Dr Barwin](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/disgraced-fertility-doctor-agrees-to-13m-settlement-with-families-including-17-barwin-babies-1.6119754). Had some twenty children by unsuspecting women who were expecting to have their partner's kids. I froze my sperm with him twenty years ago. At the start of the pandemic, I finally had it tested--the sample came back as *not mine*. I've been paying to have it stored all those years for nothing.

Some things you should know:

* A doctor impregnating random women with their sperm isn't considered a criminal offense, like rape, because *no physical contact was involved.*
* All the medical system did was force him into retirement at 90, or however old he is.
* Although there was a settlement, only those who'd already had kids received it.
* The settlement's depend on the legal fiction that Barwin just ""made a mistake,"" so his insurance will cover it instead of having to prove the high legal bar of wrong-doing and rely on his personal net worth to compensate everyone.
* All the fertility doctors I've dealt with (or their lawyers) are obstructing my ability both to get the remaining sperm tested, and even if any of the straws are mine, to use it, because they're afraid of being exposed to Barwin's *liability* despite the fact that even Barwin himself is all but inviolable.
* My lawyers and Barwin's lawyers are stalling even on dealing with the statue of limitations issue.

I wanted to have a family even since I was 18 and had to make a difficult choice about my body. That's probably never going to happen now. The goal I had for my life is dead and now I'm too depressed, miserable, and poor to even to afford counselling. I know from experience that if anything happens, the hospitals will just turn me away. I've been trying to wait out my disperse since the start of the pandemic but there's no hope of relief in sight.

Lesson learned: there is no justice in this country. There is no social contract binding our actions to a mutual good. The law exists to perpetuate delusions of security while the strong prey on the weak, and you should treat the law accordingly.","ottawa",946,946,0,0.97,1,0,0,145

Mox drinks ""Athletic Brewing Company"" non alcoholic beer.  He says that it helps him remain sober because he has to go to whole foods before every show and buy it and it reminds him not to drink.

When he returned said he didn't immediately feel better, he felt off and worried that ""He sucked now"". Didn't really feel comfortable until halfway through BD match at the PPV.

Talked about getting advice coming up and how he tells people to listen to advice but not to take everything to heart and how often times what he is told will not be correct for him.  Talks about how he was pushed into WWE style and a lot of what he was told he learned to hate, stuff like not doing too much, hardcore being garbage, and planning spots before hand being for suckers. 

Thinks Vince would hate a lot of his matches.   

Loves the atmosphere of places like GCW which is like a concert. 

Was having crazy nightmares and mood swings before he went to rehab. 

Therapist in Rehab told him to retire and start a school.  Mox told her no.  

Mox had his phone in airplane mode for a long times. He didn't have his phone in rehab, and even when it was offered back to him he told them to keep it because he felt better without it. 

Mox was a ""high functioning"" alcoholic. He realized he had a problem when he had to have a period he was sober and he was having massive withdrawals. He became worried that quitting cold turkey or not drinking would cause him to die. 

He went in on Halloween night. He had tried to quit before the baby was born, but found it incredibly hard to do. 

Eddie checked in on Renee a lot while Mox was in Rehab. 

Mox came home loaded from his flight and was handing out candy bars to trick or treaters while he was on the phone with rehab booking.  

Renee called Tony Khan and explained to him what was happening and Tony asked how they want to explain his absence and Mox said he didn't care. He thought it was ""cool"" that everyone just knew.

Didn't get to enjoy his book releasing because he was disconnected from it. They had a book tour planned and he missed it because he was in rehab. 

Picture of before and after rehab and Shredded Mox and everyone saying he looks like he's in great shape he finds weird because he feels like he's in shit shape because theres no such thing as in ring shape without being in the ring. 

Says he's obsessed with his baby.

He was told early on that the first time you hold your baby you become obsessed, and when he held his baby for the first time ""Nothing"". (kind of a joke) He became obsessed with her and is just wild for her. 

Talks about when you come home and you get the dogs running and jumping how great it is, but the ""Baby Pop"" doubles it and how happy the baby is to see him. 

Jon is tired of Forbidden Door term, thought it was fine but now is tired of it because its not a ""forbidden door"" anymore. 

Talks about signing with New Japan for a 6 month term initially and having been in both feds at the same time the whole time.  

Hes proud of Forbidden door happening. 

Talks about how great the AEW schedule is and how with how with only working one day a week guys should be able to go over to Japan easier.  Loved Yuta in BOSJ and fully supported him missing AEW PPV to be in the BOSJ. 

Lots of people told him to stop working with New Japan, when Harold was fired it was much easier for him.  

Brought in Kenta and Nagata, and after a while when New Japan would come to him would just say ""Talk to Tony."" and it happens. 

Wants to facilitate additional relationships.  Wants to give back, and really loves the BCC and how much it lets him interact with other guys. 

Loves how BCC has worked out, they have a group text and send videos back and forth.  Regal shows up at 10/11 am and works with young guys all the time.  Mox thinks its super fun. 

Bryan had the idea for them to form a team. 

They didn't go over the promo where Bryan suggested the BCC before hand, Mox heard the promo at the same time we did, thought that Bryan made a really good case. Mox thought it was way more interesting for them to team up and texted Bryan and said they should give it a shot. They had to sell it to Tony who thought it would be short term. 

When Mox found out that Regal was released he pitched bringing in Regal to Bryan found out Bryan had already pitched it to Tony and Tony had already had the same idea and contracted Regal who was going to be at the PPV. 

Thinks being in BCC is a stamp of honor, similar to Hart Dungeon. (Please make Shota a full fledged member) Thinks BCC can go forever, even if he and Bryan retire. 

Talks about being able to be the first 2 time AEW champion. Used to watch Tanahashi matches and steal spots in FCW.  Has wanted to wrestle Tanahashi for a long time. Sees himself as ""Big Game Hunting"" New Japan.  He doesn't care about the belts as much, but wants to wrestle all of the legends. 

Tony told Mox he had stopped the Mox Tanahashi match from happening a bunch of times, and it kind of pissed off Mox a bit, but he's excited because thats HIS match and what hes been waiting for. 

Sees facing Tanahashi as the final step in his transformation from when he decided to leave WWE to now. 

Getting to step in the ring with the Ace is huge to him and a culmination. 

Jumping straight to Blood and Guts after Tanahashi isn't' an easy balance, but its something he can do. 

Felt his first run was marred.  (Being in a pandemic?) 

Saw Forbidden door announced, wasn't sure he would be on the card. 

Can't call Mox lucky, because of his work and because of how he set things up in his life to be able to work the matches he does. Sees that he does what he does because he loves doing it.  Renee says it inspires her because of seeing him live his dream.

Talks in baby voice all the time now. (yes he uses the baby voice) 

Mox ends with a joke.","SquaredCircle",931,931,0,0.94,1,0,0,168

2 years. 
Your death anniversary passed 4 days ago. Its marked 2 years of the most traumatic experience Ive had as an emergency room nurse.

2 years.
Two years without you running the ship. Its been a tumultuous ride, but I think you would be proud that the ER staff has kept your values and your way of managing alive. Your spirit is alive in the staff you left behind. Your memories remain and the stories we share of you keep you immortal. 

2 years. 
I now sit in the chair you once sat on. Still a baby at it. Its only been 2 months officially. Took on the position you had. Your shoes are huge! Its a bittersweet feeling because as much as I love taking on this new role, I would have much loved taking over once you had retired. 

2 years.
Thinking back on the past two years and the trauma of the pandemic is still very raw. I dont wish to experience it again. Never had so many losses in a matter of weeks and now things are settling into a new norm like 2020 almost didnt happen. 

They say that when someone you love become a memory, that memory becomes a treasure. 2020 made sure we had a lot of treasures but the treasures were painful. 

To those who have loved ones working as nurses, doctors, techs, EMS: check up on them. We bottle in a lot. We appreciate the check ins.

Anna and I werent ready for kids. Not yet. 

The plan, if you can even call it that, was to enjoy each others company for a few good years and then we could discuss family. I was open to the idea of having kids of my own one day, but I wanted to really enjoy time with my new wife. I knew how my own mom had struggled with raising me and my brothers at a young age due to an unexpected pregnancy and winding up a single parent because my dad walked out on her. 

I didnt want to repeat those same mistakes. 

Anna, however, became swept up in baby fever when she met a woman named Bridget at a local park. I think that the two hit it off playing tennis or something and they became friends. We had just moved to this little town and Anna was always a social butterfly. 
Anna explained after getting to know Bridget that she had been practicing to become a midwife, something that in this day and age was hardly common anymore. And once they became closer friends Bridget even told her she would be there to help Anna during the birth. 

I didnt think much of their idle talk. I figured that it was all conjecture as long as Anna was on birth control. 

Then one day she showed me the results of a pregnancy strip. Positive. I was floored. I thought this would never happen to me until I was ready. 

She announced she had to call Bridget immediately to tell her the good news, but my mind was spinning about how difficult this pregnancy was going to be for us. 

First there was the matter of finances. I knew that taking care of a newborn was no small task. The hospital bill alone would put us into bankruptcy. And then there was the pandemic. Everything was uncertain and even going to a medical facility seemed like it was akin to signing your death certificate. 

Bridget had a solution that seemed to resolve both of my concerns: home birth. Admittedly it had never even crossed my mind. 

We didnt always have fancy doctors that charged us an arm and leg for birthing. Mother Nature took its course and we learned how to handle things as they came, she explained.  

I had my concerns, but she had already convinced Anna. 
This would not only save us money, but be safer for the baby as long as we did what was necessary to prepare. 

So we began to watch every video on the subject online, read any google article we could and Anna even joined chat rooms to see how other women did it. 

Bridget told us though that none of that would really apply to our situation, especially since we didnt know very many people in the area. 

It would literally be just me, my wife and her. If youll have me there, of course. I dont want to impose, she said with the softest of smiles. 

I wouldnt dare try to handle this on my own. Youre the expert, I told her. 

I did try to contact my parents to see if they could come and stay while I worked during the second trimester because Anna became bedridden, but Covid interrupted those plans too. 

Your dad tested positive and we would never forgive ourselves if something happened to the baby& by the way do you know if its a boy or a girl yet? Mom asked. 

I shook my head and laughed. Mom, I already told you, we didnt do an ultrasound. Its going to be a surprise. 

Im sure there must be some way to make sure that the baby is doing all right though, completely healthy I mean, she said. 

Bridget has offered to come stay with us until the birth. I think I might take her up on the offer so she can attend to Anna, I told her. 

Mom wasnt too keen on that idea. 

I dont know Ryan, I mean you dont really know her that well do you? 

Its been a good few months since we moved here and shes really the only friend that Anna has made, I told her but something about moms tone worried me. My mom was an excellent judge of character, so I told her that I would consider carefully Bridgets proposal. 

But all of that was tossed out the window about a week later when Anna became very sick. I was sure it was Covid and I wanted to rush her to the hospital emergency room. 

Doing that would compromise her immune system and the baby, Bridget told me, and added, I can brew something up. I have a remedy for everything. 

An hour or so later she came back with a bowl of broth; some sort of oils and a vaporize along with other homeopathic remedies I wasnt too familiar with. 

Ryan, I know you want to watch after her but I think a few days of isolation will do her good, Bridget told me. 

Of course I trusted her judgement and checked on my wife from a distance. Her condition didnt sound good. Either Anna was shaking from a seizure or throwing up as Bridget worked tirelessly to cure her. Often she would mumble under her breath how the baby was draining Anna of life itself and I tried to inquire further but she insisted it would be fine. 

This is just a test. We shall see it through, she responded. I wanted both my wife and child to be fine, fearful that I would soon have to choose one or the other. Thankfully though that nightmare never materialized and I had Bridget to thank. 

Now I was in her debt and felt obligated to let her stay. 

I couldnt bear to have something happen again and you not be here, I explained. 

She agreed and moved in right after the third trimester, converting our master bedroom until a birthing pod for the newborn. 

According to the majority of the studies we had seen, having Anna give birth while submerged seemed like the smartest move so I wasnt surprised when Bridget told me that I needed to purchase some kind of wading pool. 

Shouldnt we wait until its almost due? I asked her. Anna still had a few months to go, and I hated to think of my bedroom being transformed so drastically. 

We need to do what is best for the child, Bridget told me. And my wife listened to any request she made, so I soon felt powerless in my own home. 

Bridget also brought trinkets, items like dream catchers and other superstitious stuff that she told me would provide us good fortune for the birth. It was beginning to concern me that anything she said Anna would do. 

I tried to talk to my wife about it several times during those weeks leading up to the birth, but Bridget was almost always within earshot. 
And the few times when we were alone, Anna was so weak from morning sickness and other pregnancy complications I didnt want to stress her out any further. 

Truth be told I was beginning to worry about this home birth idea altogether. 

Screw the cost, I wanted to be sure my wife would live through the process. It was clear that this was going to be the hardest thing she had ever done. 

My mom kindly reminded me that I still didnt really know Bridget. What is her track record? She says she is a midwife but how many successful pregnancies has she been a part of? You need to make sure Ryan. This is your child we are talking about. 

One afternoon I managed to slip into Bridgets purse while she was busy handling another bout of sickness from Anna, but I couldnt hardly find anything substantial there that told me who she was. 

I tried to do a bit of internet research too, but the woman hadnt a digital footprint, or in other words if she was online I couldnt find it. 

The doubts I was having started to intensify when I came to check on them and heard Bridget chanting something. Alarm bells in my head told me it wasnt some kind of sacred prayer and I confronted her about it. 

We need all the help we can to make sure the birth is a safe and healthy event for the child& Mother Nature is the one that is causing all of this to happen so we must appease her, Bridget told me in the most serene voice. 

She was making some kind of incense that was designed to heighten senses and relax the soul, or so she claimed. Honestly I was beginning to feel uncomfortable around her and wanted to know what her motives were. I needed to convince Anna to get to the hospital before I lost her entirely. 

The time of the birth is nearly here. A child will come into this world. I must make final  preparations, Bridget said unexpectedly one night. It was the first time I had been even in Annas room for about a week. 

It was now or never to make my case and get her to the hospital. 

Opening the door, I was struck with the most awful of sights. My wife no longer looked like the healthy vibrant woman I knew.

Her skin was sagging, hardly able to attach itself to her bones as though she had hardly had a bite to eat. And there wasnt any fat, nor muscle to be seen. A brief image of starvation that I had seen once on television flashed across my mind, but even that wouldnt be an apt description. 

There were boils and sores across her body, some open and others festering with puss. Like a burn victim that had constantly been scratching at their sores, everywhere I looked she was but a shell of a human. All I was suffering& except near her swollen belly. 

Veins snaked across her stomach like vines that were choking on a once vibrant tree, pulsing rapidly as she took a breath in and out. Slowly, painfully. And whatever was under her skin would writhe, pushing itself out like it was trying to snatch one more morsel of food as it prepared to rip its way out of her body. 

This couldnt be natural. My wife was sick and desperately needed help. I didnt care what her wishes were, so I decided to storm out and call an ambulance. I would ask for forgiveness later. 

Hello? Ryan Delmint here&. I began as I rounded the corner and stopped dead in my tracks. Bridget was standing there, watching me the way a predator does whenever they corner their victim. 

Or like a mother bear trying to protect her cub, a feral instinct was taking over her when she saw what I was trying to do. 

Before I could even bother to speak to her, she grabbed the phone out of my hand and tossed it to the wall with so much force that it shattered into a dozen pieces. 

And **what** do you think you are doing? she snarled. 

Anna needs to get to a hospital or our child will die, I insisted, suddenly angry and defensive and frightened. I had never seen this side of her. It was like a bottle bubbling over that couldnt be stopped. 

That isnt your decision, its *her* body. And you are disrespecting her wishes! Bridget declared. 

I opened the door to where Anna was wearily trying to stay awake. Or to stay alive, I wasnt sure which. Every breath sounded as though it were strained. 

As though it might be her last. 

Cant you see that what she wants and what she needs are two different things right now? She needs to get to a hospital or we will lose them both! 

Bridget laughed. It made my hair stand on its end. She didnt care about my wife. 

And then, behind her I saw three dark figures in the door. All female, all holding what looked like ropes and straps, ready to tie Anna down the way a stock animal would be. 

All they cared about was the birth of this child. Then I heard Anna begin to scream as a contraction came and rippled through her body. 

Your faith has no place here. All that matters is the child. This life is sacred and you will not interfere, Bridget declared, a darkness covering her face. The three women were surrounding me before I could object. Grabbing my arms and pushing me back out. I tried my best to fight, but they were stronger than I anticipated. They easily could have broken my arms I think, but instead I think they wanted me to watch. 

They wanted me to see what unnatural creation was about to be made. 

And it was that moment of realization I realized that there was no way this could be my child. 

And as the screams of my wife filled the room, I realized it was too late. I was thinking I was going to now watch her die. 

The women pushed down hard on my shoulder blade enough to bruise as I saw that Bridget had brought several other strangers to my home for this event. All of them shielded me from entering the room as I frantically tried to call out to my wife. I had nothing to defend myself with. And all I could think of what the ungodly sight I was witnessing. It mesmerized me as they strapped and stretched her legs apart, pulling down her clothing and exposing her naked body as if her pride and her dignity was of no consequence. 

The dead look in their eyes made it all too clear their only objective was the task of birthing this child, which even now was pushing its way out of her body. 

I saw long claws that were as dark as ash scratching at the walls of her thighs, spindlely and covered with the same wretched sores I had seen all over her. There were at least five of them, the kind you might see were this a trapdoor spider emerging from its hideout. 

There was a low hiss that revealed two misshapen heads, bent and broken skulls that were neatly meshed together at the neck, one slightly human and the other the face of a devil. 

It looked as though the latter had affecfively been devouring what little was left of what might have been my child. Its eyes were the strangest part, clearer than the blue sky and double irises, twitching and roaming the room in search of something. 

They fell upon me and the strange abomination let out an inhuman shriek. I heard Annas bones break and her skin tear apart as the women around her moaned and held her down. They all had scalpels and short jagged knives, cutting at their own body and letting their blood dribble down to the carpet. 

The unformed body that was pushing its way out of Anna opened its jaws wider than any animal I had seen, lapping up the blood like a newborn would milk with its grotesquely misshapen tongue. It reminded me of a charred cactus, and beyond it, in the belly of this newborn evil I could see rows and rows of teeth that stretched down its esophagus. 

Using every last bit of strength I had left, I pushed one of the women away and grabbed at a chair, using it as a line of defense for these insane women. They immediately blocked the birth, waiting as Bridget finished carving some ancient rune in my wifes forehead as I managed to reach our hallway closet. 

A gun was hidden there,  one I swore I would never had needed for and yet today I was thankful Anna had insisted we buy it. I used the chair to prop the closet open and retrieved the gun from behind a few old albums, aiming it toward the group of women. 

I had no idea how much ammo might be in it but I swore it would have to be enough. 

Bridget was humming to the strange creature that lurched and slipped onto the carpet, its legs covered in mucus and leftover afterbirth that was gelatinous and festering with poison. It followed and obeyed her the way a lamb might a Shepard. 

We are done here. They are of no consequence. Our kind may live on now, she declared as the women suddenly began to scatter like cockroaches. The spider like child pushed itself over top of me, its twisted features a ghastly sight to see so close to my face as it licked across my cheek like a dog. 

Yet this was no sign of affection, for as it finished the task barbs as sharp as needles pierced my skin and I instinctively dropped my weapon, hardly able to do anything except seize in pain. 

Bridget was last to leave, looking down at my prone form with pity. 

For a body is needed for a life to be given in the Summer Courts, she declared ominously, her eyes glimmering as bright as gold. 

Then she stepped out and my vision became as dark as night. 

I dont know how long I was out, when I came to I heard the softest cries coming from the room. 

Anna. Her body torn apart and her soul equally shattered, but somehow she clung to life. 

I scrambled to find her own cell phone and this time made the successful call to 911. 

_____

Its been about a month now, enough time for me to compose these thoughts and for Anna to begin seeking counseling and therapy. She is still but a hollow shell, hardly able to move or act without my assistance. And even though she is beginning to resume her normal life, I can see that her eyes are as dead as the women that took this precious moment from us. She may never be the same. 

I could hardly explain things to the nurses, some of whom thought I sought her harm and I even spent a few nights in a holding cell until Anna vouched for me, but then again I have hardly understood what happened myself. We never saw Bridget again, nor do we know why she came into our lives. 

The scars and broken memories are enough to last a lifetime.

A few years ago my wife came to me and said, I want a few chickens she wanted to raise our own eggs. We lived in the city and my immediate reaction was not only no, but hell no. I had never lived in the country or even been hunting. Well it turns out city ordinances allow chickens but no roosters. Over the next few months she kept explaining why we should get some chickens. The word she used was nagging. Her word not mine. One morning I woke up and she must have had a pillow over my face while I slept; because, oxygen deprivation is the only thing I can think of that made me give in. 

So, we set off to the local farm supply store to get three, THREE, chicks a coop-in-a-box with attached run (more on that disaster later) and the other necessary equipment for the budding chicken rancher. We picked out what looked like a good coop-in-a-box, (some assembly required) bottles, feeder, feed, and a heat lamp. While I was looking at something, she picked the chicks. Notice I kept saying three. Oh wait, this was my first exposure to farm math, we got six chicks. My wife explained that one of them would probably end up being a rooster that would have to go and at least one or two would die. Yeah, I believed this. It sounded reasonable to a city boy. Hell, I didnt even know the difference between straw and hay. I wasnt even sure there was a difference.

So, we get home and she takes the six, not three, chicks into the house. I unload the coop-in-a-box and start to assemble this thing. The first thing I noticed is the material the coop-in-a-box was made of looked cheap, as in low quality, not inexpensive. The second thing I noticed was it was designed to sit on concrete or at least perfectly flat smooth ground. So, after it was assembled, I wasnt happy. It looked rickety and the joints didnt seem very tight, but it was up and ready. What I didnt know was the chicks werent ready for the coop. For the next six weeks give or take the chicks lived in a plastic tote improvised brooder in an unused bedroom. My Yellow Lab spent a lot of time at that door hoping for a miracle. No eggs yet; but, hey, its still early. During this time, I noticed that the hinges on the nesting box werent water resistant much less water tight. Every time it rained the nesting box flooded. After a little creative engineering that problem was fixed and time to get these chirpy nuggets out of the house. By the way, there were still six chicks, not three. They did quick work on the  grass in the run. It was turned to bare dirt in a matter of days. I quickly noticed that the latches for the coop and run doors were not very secure and replaced them with better hardware.  Still no eggs. Little freeloaders. 

About this time my wife started to talk about meat rabbits. I think she had taken to drugging me. Thats my story and Im sticking to it. I didnt even resist, well not too much. I think I was starting to like the idea of raising our own food. Dont tell her. I like letting her think she talked me into something I was willing to do anyway.  She found a used hutch set up on Craigs list and I mounted them under the back yard deck, after some modification and wire replacement. We got a buck and three does. 

At about this time, I started to feel the chickens didnt have enough room and cleaning the coop-in-a-box was very difficult. So, I built a 8x16 foot enclosed run to surround the coop-in-a-box. This also solved the problem of the coop-in-a-box door hinges starting to come loose. After I built the run, I could leave the coop-in-a-box open. It also made cleaning much easier because we didnt have to worry about escape attempts. The grass in the newly expanded run lasted about three weeks before it looked like the dirt in the coop-in-a-box run. Im sure everyone knows what happens when it rains on a chicken run. We had a mud pit. Back to the farm supply store for some metal roofing. Now the still six chickens had a roof over their run. 

Still not one egg; but, we had had our first litter of bunnies. So, I went to the kitchen grabbed a frying pan, walked out to the chickens, and showed the pan to the freeloading miniature raptors. I told them I was putting either eggs or them in this pan. Two days latter we got our first egg. Yeehaw, happy dance. My wife still thinks my threat had nothing to do with the beginnings of egg production. What does she know. We started getting one egg a day per bird shortly after that. 

Soon I was the primary egg dealer at work. I had no idea there was such a large market for fresh eggs. We also started to see rabbit as part of our diet. I started selling rabbit poop to a few people who had raised garden beds. Yes, I became a shit dealer. Who would have thunk it. I had no idea such a market even existed. But duuuuude I got really goooood shit. 

It was about this time I learned that chicken wire will not stop a Lab. He thought he was in squeaky toy nirvana. That incident got me down to four chickens. Yup, back to the farm supply store for supplies to reinforce the run with hardware cloth. Shortly after this my lab started hanging out at the door to that unused bedroom. After a few days I herd a bird like noise coming from the bedroom. I figured one of my kids had left a window open and I was hearing birds in a tree. Guess what, there were baby chicks in that make shift tote brooder. I didnt have four chickens, not even six. I now had a total of eight chickens. EIGHT IS NOT THREE not even if you use that new math theyre teaching!

Even before we married, the wife and I had been casually looking for a place with a few acres. Nothing really came of it and the idea kind of slid to the back of our minds. Then one day a friend of mine called to tell us about a piece of land that was on the market. 60 acres with four bedroom house, an attached two car garage, tractor shed, work shop and a small pond. Long story short, we ended up buying it. We still had our place in the city because it was 100 miles from the property to my job. We spent every weekend on the property. Then my mother who was living with us got to the point she needed a wheelchair. The house in the city was built in 1890 and not wheelchair friendly, not even a little. So my wife took my mother and moved to the property. Open floor plan, wheelchair ramps front and rear and one story. My brother had different days off then I did so we rotated down to the property to help take care of my mother and give my wife a break. 

Property like this does require maintenance. Three acres of grass to cut, eight acres to brush hog, trails to keep clear, a big garden and firewood to cut. And that requires equipment and time. 

Little did I know how things were moving along and I was being changed. Damn chickens. The first thing I did was build an eight by eight chicken coop that was eight feet tall. I could clean it without getting on my hands and knees. I did this on my own no prompting. It was built using the lessons of what not to do that I learned from the coop-in-a-box. Attached to that was a 20x40 run. Can you tell I think there should be a place in hell reserved for the people who make those coop-in-a-box contraptions? My city chickens became country chickens. Next was a better improved rabbit setup. We now have two hutches. One with four large cages and one with eight smaller cages. We still have the three does and one buck. But more room for grow out. I also built two chicken tractors. 

Somewhere along the line we decided to get Guinea Hens to help with the tick control. We let them free range 100% of the time. Those little beggars are loud and stupid.  Every predator thinks they are just scrumptious; but, they finally figured out how to survive; at least most of them did, about half at least. 

Then came the quail and an incubators. We are now hatching out chickens, quail, and Guinea Hens. I was surprised to see what you can get for bunnies, baby chicks and Guinea keets at an animal swap. Given how stupid Guinea Hens are and the resulting high mortality rate, they have turned out to be some of the most profitable critters we have. The only hard part is finding their nests so we can steal the eggs. 

I retired during Covid pandemic. We sold the house in the city and I moved to the farm full time. More time on my hands meant more time for animals. We only have about four acres of pasture. The rest is wooded with underbrush. You know who likes wooded land and brush? Goats, thats who. So after learning how to build a goat resistant fence and listening to goats for dummies, we have six dairy goats. My wife is the primary animal person in this arrangement. I do infrastructure, she knows animals. She actually had me listen to goats for dummies on a road trip. If you ever do listen to goats for dummies skip the parts on goat disease and illness. Those chapters makes them sound like plague animals that will explode if you look at them wrong, or just out of spite, Yeesh. 

One thing we do have is a coyote population. They were responsible for several of the Guinea losses. We dont want to be fattening up the local coyote population with expensive dairy goats; so, we got ourselves two Great Pyrenees as guardian dogs. Boy do they take their job seriously. Coyotes, opossum, raccoons and even hawks tend to stay away now. Theyre even willing to challenge a thunderstorm. We get our first bucks next month. Im taking a break from building their fence as I write this. 

So now Im maintaining 60 acres, helping with 6 goats, 30ish chickens, about 20 rabbits right now, 15 quail, only god knows how many Guinea Hens(counting them is like counting gold fish), building fences, animal shelters, training guard dogs, sending chickens, rabbits and quail to freezer camp, running a brush hog, chainsaw, wood splitter and spending my Saturdays at animal swaps instead of enjoying the big city life. I miss my Starbucks, ok not really. And it all started with my wife asking the innocent question. Can we have a few chickens for the eggs. Evil little gateway animals. 

This is all basically true and written with the intent to hopefully make someone smile or even laugh. All joking aside, I dont think I have ever been happier.

# CONNECTIONS WITH EVIDENCE OR CONFIRMED

**BRUNO MARS (2009-2011)**

[Rita herself claims that she met Bruno in 2009 when he was hired to write songs for her.](https://www.capitalfm.com/artists/rita-ora/news/bruno-mars-relationship/) She claims they ended it in 2011. Bruno Mars denied every comment. Probably bc he was in a relationship with Chanel Malvar during that time, meaning that he would have cheated on her with Rita. He allegedly wrote *When I was your Man* about the situation. [Thats them being in a club together in 2011.](https://youtu.be/5QXZeo8-UJ8) I didn't find anything on the net that would support her claim other than them working and hanging out together.

**ROBERT KARDASHIAN (2011-2012)**

In December 2011 news broke that Rob could be dating Rita. Exactly a year later in December 2012 he went on a Twitter rant that she [allegedly cheated on him with more than 20 men.](https://starcasm.net/rob-kardashian-accuses-ex-rita-ora-of-being-with-20-men-while-dating/) She responded by tweeting at him that his dick was whack and she had to get it somewhere else. He retaliated by claiming [they were expecting at some point](https://heavy.com/news/2012/12/rob-kardashian-rita-ora-pregnant-twee/) but didnt elaborate on why the pregnancy wasnt brought to term. [She addressed](https://www.her.ie/celeb/it-wasnt-a-relationship-rita-ora-comes-clean-about-what-happened-with-rob-kardashian-28005)[ it a few months later,](https://www.her.ie/celeb/it-wasnt-a-relationship-rita-ora-comes-clean-about-what-happened-with-rob-kardashian-28005) and while she didnt deny anything he said, she did say she never deemed them, boyfriend and girlfriend. There were seen hanging out together and posting about each other online, but it was vague enough to potentially believe her claim that they were semi-exclusively hooking up eventually trying to make it work but it never materialized. 

**ASAP ROCKY (AUTUMN 2012)**

She was seen hanging out with him in the autumn of 2012, and he cheated on his then-girlfriend with her. It came to light when he published his album in 2015 [mentioning her](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/asaprocky/betterthings.html) in the song *Better Things*. [He claims she caused him a lot of trouble with her big mouth](https://thenet.ng/how-aap-rocky-cheated-with-rita-ora-while-in-a-relationship/). He apologized since. She again didnt deny anything but said she was upset that he gives the impression that it is okay for men to treat women like that.

**CALVIN HARRIS (MAY 2013 - SPRING 2014)**

Rita and Calvin historically havent had a great rapport based on their Twitter interactions. They had a public back and forth about [her allegedly lying](https://imgur.com/a/TNjS4yJ) about being offered a song. Eventually patching things up and working for the same label [led to him taking her to an event.](https://www.shutterstock.com/de/editorial/image-editorial/daft-punk-random-access-memories-album-playback-party-london-britain-13-may-2013-2334874z) In the following months, they frequently talked about each other or shared stuff on social. Some of his contacts would lead to her biggest hits after they broke up. Calvin, Avicii, and Tiësto would make having Rita as a feature a great staple in EDM music. He was very busy during the time and acquired a home in Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Rita was primarily busy networking and grew closer to Kate Moss. They were hanging out a lot while Rita accompanied Calvin to gigs. He visited her on set when she was filming 50 Shades. There are two stories about *I Will Never Let You Down*. Rita claims [they came up with it together](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/rita-ora/i-will-never-let-you-down). Calvin firmly stated [he wrote that song](https://youtu.be/uzAC0Gr7Z-Q?t=127). (They both have been on Ryan Seacrest after the split talking about it so you can watch [her visit first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6xwhCREA94) and his visit afterward.) However, they recorded the song together and made their red carpet debut in January 2014. After it was published rumors started to break that their relationship might be a little rocky. [Allegedly he wasn't happy with her ripping Zac Efrons shirt off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8TKRNPSIuc) in April while he was doing Coachella. They eventually went on a break after getting together at *Radio 1s Big Weekend* at the end of May and Calvin informed the world, including Rita, via Twitter by early June that they had broken up a while ago. By that time he had contributed four more songs for her upcoming album. Rumors spread the reason for the split was her cheating on him, while she maintained it was due to their busy schedules. [One story claims](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2660125/Rita-Ora-makes-feelings-known-offensive-motif-jumper-claimed-Calvin-Harris-dumped-secret-visit-LA.html) she stayed in a hotel in LA without telling him. [Others claimed](https://perezhilton.com/rita-ora-touchy-feely-with-justin-bieber-before-calvin-harris-breakup/) she was flirting with Justin Bieber. The split however seemed amicable until August, when Rita [was supposed to perform at the Teen Choice Awards](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/aug/13/rita-ora-calvin-harris-blocked-teen-choice-award-performance) and put her own money into the performance until Calvin didnt approve it a day prior. They then started to become a little cryptic about the split, giving each other backhanded compliments. He alluded to having very good reasons for the split and pointing at her determination to be successful, claiming she will be around longer than most. She called him out multiple times for the *Teen Choice Awards* saying she has no idea why he did that. He also wouldn't let her use the songs they/he wrote for her album. They were both signed at RocNation and allegedly Rita wanted RN to force Calvin to let her record the songs but RN sided with him. Ultimately one of the reasons leading to Rita suing RN. Calvin went on to work with multiple ppl Rita has an issue with. Rihanna who allegedly sabotaged Rita at RocNation and Dua Lipa who Rita is feuding. Both songs were significantly more successful. 

# CONNECTIONS WITH EVIDENCE BUT UNCONFIRMED

**CARA DELEVINGNE (Somewhere 2012-2013)**

Cara and Rita started being seen out together in the summer of 2012 surrounded by their party entourage. Over the years they always seemed close and [played with the narrative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=am-KOgCCmL4) of them actually hooking up.

Years later Rita still didnt confirm anything. [She claims the relationship was ambiguous](https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/105895/Rita-Ora-talks-ambiguous-relationship-with-Cara-Delevingne)[.](https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/105895/Rita-Ora-talks-ambiguous-relationship-with-Cara-Delevingne) She also claims they started a trend. I dont know what she means by that, but it came up when she came out with the song *Girls* in 2018. She claimed this song is not about anything more than supporting other females, [despite the lyrics telling a different story](https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ritaora/girls.html). But once the song received backlash for exploiting being bisexual as something you can appropriate to cater to the male gaze and cause controversy without any stigma that might come with it the narrative changed. Ora then claimed that it was actually telling her story of being bisexual herself and that she had romantic relationships with other women and [was now forced to come out bc ppl were questioning her.](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/rita-ora/girls) 

**DAVE GARDNER (2013)**

They were seen a lot together in 2013 which is not unusual per se bc they shared the same circles. They [hung out overnight](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2281084/Rita-Ora-leaves-Dave-Gardners-house-wearing-SAME-outfit-night-partying-storm-LFW-bash.html). They [were seen out and about](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2309931/Rita-Ora-steps-David-Beckhams-best-friend-Dave-Gardner-days-Vegas-break-Luke-Magill.html) picking stuff up. Some mystical sources revealed they were having something. And then there is [the Calvin Harris incident](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2492799/Rita-Ora-spotted-ex-Dave-Gardner-shortly-posting-I-miss-baby-picture-boyfriend-Calvin-Harris.html). He wasnt seen with her afterward (except for rare bump-ins) and not since he started dating Liv Tyler.

**LUKE MAGNILL (APRIL 2013)**

[Both were seen cozying up at a pool in Las Vegas coming and leaving together.](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2305740/Rita-Ora-canoodles-new-beau-derriere-view.html) Looks a little bit too intimate to be a just friends situation. They also werent seen together afterward. 

# CONNECTIONS WITH NO EVIDENCE OR HAVE BEEN DENIED

**DRAKE (ALLEGEDY 2012)**

Drake wrote her song R.I.P. and she spoke positively about him. There are a few pics of them hanging out, but nothing that would justify assuming they hooked up other than their dating habits in general. She also denied it publicly. 

**JONAH HILL (ALLEGEDLY 2012)**

[A couple of blinds went around](https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a446891/rita-ora-cheated-on-rob-kardashian-with-jonah-hill/) claiming Rita cheated on Rob with Jonah Hill, who bragged about it, which was the final straw for Rob. I couldnt find anything other that would support that claim. Also, CDAN is involved who has a hate boner for her.

**EVAN ROSS (JANUARY 2013)**

[Rita was spotted making out with him at Goldbar in SoHo.](https://www.ibtimes.com/rita-ora-kisses-evan-ross-nightclub-she-moves-rob-kardashian-1001554) Both of them had been single at that time and are friends to this day. They have been spotted numerous times together during that time and ever since. The timeline and location make sense. Kissing someone is not that big of a deal. Neither of them commented on it. 

**SNOOP DOG (ALLEGEDLY JANUARY 2013)**

[They went together to Thailand](https://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2013/rita-ora-snoop-dogg-sex-affair-sleeping-together-thailand-twitter-photos-0116/) which made ppl think they are an item, but they were just shooting the [(unintentionally funny) music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6jsWWo2_1M) for a collab. 

**JAY-Z** (Allegedly somewhere between 2012-2015)

Rita was signed with Roc Nation when she was 18 years old in December of 2008. After her first attempt at making an album was scrapped by the label, she finally published her debut in 2012. Prior to all the scandals. No rumors gained track up until late 2012 or early 2013 after Rob Kardashian blasted her on Twitter for allegedly cheating and promiscuous behavior. [Holly Hagan claimed she heard Rita was having an affair with Jay-Z.](https://www.celebdirtylaundry.com/2013/jay-z-beyonce-cheating-rita-ora-holly-hagan-0103/) Ppl went wild afterward. [To give you an impression of ](https://theboxhouston.com/8851412/friend-tells-beyonce-jay-z-secrets/)[how wild claims became.](https://theboxhouston.com/8851412/friend-tells-beyonce-jay-z-secrets/) Rita publicly denied it. Her comments on the label were positive and based on the PR the label provided her and [her statements made](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/12/rita-ora-jay-z) it didnt seem like the relationship was strained due to the rumors. 

In 2013 she also started dating Calvin Harris and they worked together professionally. She was also featured on Iggy Azaleas US top 10 hit *Black Widow* which marks her first positive appearance on the US market. However, her private life started affecting her work life. She had a nasty breakup with CH who was also signed to RN and one of their highest earners. She wanted RN to force CH to let her publish the songs they wrote together but instead made her restart her album production. [Allegedly she was also feuding with Rihanna.](https://www.thethings.com/this-is-why-fans-think-rihanna-doesnt-get-along-with-rita-ora/) Rihanna would block songs for herself so Rita couldnt record them. Meanwhile, Rita would record a song with her ex Chris Brown. Rita recorded *I Will Never Let You Down* with CH and later Rihanna would release the way more successful *This Is What You Came For* with him. During the summer of 2015, Rita claimed her next album would come by the end of 2015 instead she sued RN to release her of the contract. They countersued for breaking her contract. They settled in May 2016. 

Having that timeline in mind, Beyoncé dropped *Lemonade* in April 2016 with the infamous *Sorry* track, having the cheating rumors with Rita flare up again. So in the middle of the lawsuit and the press she was getting, [Rita felt inclined to Snapchat](https://www.unilad.co.uk/music/rita-ora-responds-to-rumours-she-had-an-affair-with-jay-z)[a a ](https://www.unilad.co.uk/music/rita-ora-responds-to-rumours-she-had-an-affair-with-jay-z)[picture of her in a lemon bra with a J necklace.](https://www.unilad.co.uk/music/rita-ora-responds-to-rumours-she-had-an-affair-with-jay-z) Just to turn around and clear the rumors that she of course isnt Becky with the good hair. [In May she also posted a selfie with Beyoncé at the MET gala calling her family.](https://www.vogue.com/article/beyonce-rita-ora-met-gala-2016-selfie) Shortly afterwards they settled the lawsuit. There are no really notable get-togethers recorded after Rita was released from her contract. Beyoncé congratulates her on her birthday on her website but she isnt invited to events like their Oscar party. Even though rumors around them went wild and stepped onto conspiracy theory territory, I wouldnt go as far as deem anything proof. 

**Concluding remarks:** As you may know, I am a frequent contributor to the DM subreddit. It became a running gag that I gathered random RO knowledge during the pandemic, and I started a weekly update on her. I included TW bc they are attached to the hips. I wasnt aware of how controversial TW is in the gossip world up until I started doing this, comments and direct messages were flooding in. While this for sure seems excessive, it simply has been gathered over years of being exposed to European yellow press and reading up stuff whenever I felt like it. I neither stan nor hate Rita. Huge fan of her fashion. Dont mind her music. Think she is an amazing hustler. Also think she is problematic af. I wrote up a couple of these breakdowns while watching *The Dropout.* It is not that serious. Gossipculture is nothing else than playing *Dungeons &amp; Dragons* with celebrities. We do gossip, not facts. So please dont send me crazy messages claiming I am obsessed with RO bc it makes you look obsessed with me. If you wish for other deep dives on that topic or rumored relationships of her that I didnt pick up yet pls leave me a comment.

**The next deep dives will include**: Justin Bieber, Ricky Hill, Chris Brown, Whiz Khalifa, Travis Barker, Fai Khadra, James Arthur, Lewis Hamilton, Andrew Watt, Tyrone Wood, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham, Conor McGregor, Andrew Garfield, Rafferty Law, Jude Law, Joey Essex, Romain Gavras, Taika Waititi","Fauxmoi",871,871,0,0.96,5,0,2,112

&amp;nbsp;

As is tradition, Ive tweaked my data a bit this year.  Similar to prior years, Ive lumped all of the data together into one juicy 5 year pile - think of it like career stats.  This year, however, I felt I had enough to break down the data into year-by-year chunks as well.  I thought I might be able to tease out trends and changes that were happening over time this way.  I also broke down and compared data between discs found on land vs those found in water (as I said I was going to do for years and years) to see if there was a difference.

Ill explain data collection along with some thoughts and reflections at the end if youre interested.  These tend to run long though and I assume you want to see the numbers.

Before jumping in, I have some questions for you to make predictions about.  Its a good opportunity to compare your perceptions with some actual data.  

&amp;nbsp;

Here are your questions.  

&amp;nbsp;

**1. How many discs were marked with a name and number?**


**2. Whats my disc return rate?**


**3. What brand/manufacturer was lost most frequently?**


**4. What speed of disc was lost most frequently?**


**5. What color of disc was lost most frequently?**


**6. What type of plastic was lost most frequently?**


**7. What molds were most commonly lost?**

And new for this year:

**8.  What is the most common disc lost at each speed?**

&amp;nbsp;

Ill give you a breakdown of where I find the discs in order to provide some context for your guesses.

 &amp;nbsp;

**Where were these discs found?**

 &amp;nbsp;

Basket/Tee - 4

Brush - 17

Fairway - 51

Marsh/Mud - 31

Woods - 107

Ice - 7

Roof - 2

Water (Wading and Retrievers) - 556

SCUBA - 706

&amp;nbsp;

Cleaned up a bit into land/water divide:

Land - 15%

Water - 85%

&amp;nbsp;

**Changes in Location Found over Time**

&amp;nbsp;

Ive always found the majority of discs in water, even my first season playing.  Back then it was mostly just looking from shore and finding sticks to try and fish them back out.  Many a pair of shoes were sacrificed to the mud!  For the 17-18 season, 65% of discs were found in water and 35% on land.  Its worth noting that I was not using SCUBA at this time.

As time progressed, more and more discs were found in water vs land, with the SCUBA proportion growing every year.  For 2021, 90% of the discs found were from the water, with ¾ of those being from SCUBA.

Numbers are slightly down this year, finding 563 in 2021 compared to 575 in 2020.  I attribute it to not playing as much.  Last year the pandemic had us working from home which meant lots of extra time to get out and play.  Now we have commutes again and just didnt get out quite as frequently.  Were still clocking 150+ games a year, just not the 200+ we had during the COVID year.

&amp;nbsp;

**1. How many discs were marked with a name and number?**

&amp;nbsp;

Discs marked with number:  51%

Unmarked discs:  46%

Marked, but no number:  2%

Unknown/Unrecorded:  1%

&amp;nbsp;

**How has this changed over time?**
Generally speaking, marked numbers hovered around 40% - 50% for 2017-2020.  In 2021, we did see marked discs go up to 59%.  Anecdotally, weve been doing this for 5 years now and weve had many conversations with players about losing and returning discs.  It isnt uncommon to hear them indicate that while they didnt mark discs in the past due to not being particularly hopeful for their return, now that they are aware we actively try to retrieve and return discs they would start inking them.  I like to think weve shifted the culture a bit.

Base plastic is the worst for retaining legible numbers, incidentally.

&amp;nbsp;

**2.  Whats our return rate?**

&amp;nbsp;

Returned:  38%

Pending Return:  7%

Keep it:  3%

&amp;nbsp;

561 returned discs as of whenever I crunched the numbers, with another 150 or so in the pipe to go back.  Its higher now as I let this write up sit for a minute while waiting for the time and ambition to sit down.  

Every disc with a number gets a contact, even the ones that were nasty to retrieve (part of the fun is the challenge in getting some of them).  Usually we text, but calling or using Facebook is also an option.  Typically we try twice, as well as give a few Facebook Missing Discs threads a good scouring periodically.

We typically hold onto them a few months to a few years before dispensing with them.  Many get donated, a few get sold (were not making money, just replacing gear, gas, or air), and a precious few get bagged.  More than once weve fished a nice disc out of the drink only to return it to the owner, crack out our wallets, and buy it back.

Note:  Our return rate for inked discs is quite high.  Last time I did the math we were about 75-85% return rate for those.  Unmarked gets returned at about 20% or less typically.

&amp;nbsp;

**Whats changed over time?**

&amp;nbsp;

At some point the league that played at the courses reached out to us about helping get discs back to folks.  That year we jumped our return rate up by about 20%.  I attribute it to communication and networking improvements.  They were also encouraging, so we started to go the extra mile in trying to get things back by checking facebook and whatnot.

I will say my ambition for keeping track of returns has diminished a bit.  Theres a lot of them and some folks just take their sweet time getting their plastic back.  Last year when we were in the thick of the pandemic it was more understandable, but some people just need to know when to let a disc go!  We have a nice Cloudbreaker thats been sitting in the return box for nearly 2 years now.  Moral of the story - some of the Pendings should be marked as Returned but Im starting to get lazy about keeping track because its a nuisance.

&amp;nbsp;

**3. What brand/manufacturer was lost most frequently?**

&amp;nbsp;

Innova - 45%

Discraft - 24%

Dynamic - 6%

MVP - 6%

Westside - 4%

Latitude 64 - 4%

Axiom - 3%

Prodigy - 3%

DGA - 2%

Discmania - 2%

Streamline - &lt;1%

Gateway - &lt;1%

Legacy - &lt;1%

Vibram - &lt;1%

Unknown - &lt;1%

Millenium - &lt;1%

ESP - &lt;1%

Essential - &lt;1%

Lightning - &lt;1%

Plastic Addicts - &lt;1%

Wham-O - &lt;1%

Yikun - &lt;1%

Infinite - &lt;1%

Kastaplast - &lt;1%


No real surprises here.  Innova holds a commanding lead with Discraft a notable but distant second and everybody else trailing waaaaay behind.

 &amp;nbsp;

**How has it changed over time?**

It hasnt, really.  A couple of percent maybe here and there.  The order doesnt even shift much from year to year - a Trilogy brand may shuffle with another Trilogy brand but really things are remarkably consistent.  Id say were seeing more unique brands over time but truth be told we find so few that each year we find a new brand another drops off the face of the earth.

&amp;nbsp;

**4. What speed of disc was lost most frequently?**

&amp;nbsp;

1 - &lt;1% 

2 - 3% 

3 - 3%  

4 - 5%

5 - 9%

6 - 5%

7 - 5%

8 - 3%

9 - 13% 

10 - 6%

11 - 7%

12 - 17%

13 - 19%

14 - &lt;1%

15 - &lt;1%

&amp;nbsp;

Speed rating was taken from Infinite Discss website (infinitediscs.com). 

&amp;nbsp;

**Top 5 Lost Speeds**

&amp;nbsp;

13 - 19%

12 - 17%

9 - 13%

5 - 9%

11 - 7%

High speed drivers taking up most of the top slots.  No real surprises here Id hazard.

&amp;nbsp;

**Loss % By Type:**

&amp;nbsp;

High Speed Drivers (11-14)  45%


Fairway/Control Drivers (7-10)   27%


Mids (4-6)  19%


Putters (1-3)  7%


&amp;nbsp;

Some incremental shifting towards mids and putters.  I dont think its a trend where people are throwing more modest speed discs as much as a specific hole being short and gobbling up discs, but who knows?

&amp;nbsp;

**5. What color of disc was lost most frequently?**

&amp;nbsp;

Black - 1%

Blue - 19%

Brown - &lt;1%

Clear - &lt;1%

Copper - &lt;1%

Gold - &lt;1%

Gray - 3%

Green - 7%

Orange - 12%

Peach - &lt;1%

Pink - 11%

Purple - 3%

Red - 13%

Tye Dye - 5%

Violet - 2%

White - 10%

Yellow - 13%

Unknown (Unrecorded) - &lt;1%

&amp;nbsp;


**Top 5 Lost Colors**

&amp;nbsp;

Blue - 19%

Red and Yellow - 13%

Orange - 12%

Pink - 11%

&amp;nbsp;

Blue coming in on top has a slight caveat.  For whatever reason, I lumped all blue into the same category when I recorded these.  Baby blue, powder blue, midnight blue, navy blue&all counted the same.  Purple got split with violet, red split with pink, but blue&blue just got dumped in a pile.  

Its worth noting here that I DID actually crunch the numbers on the difference between land finds and water finds.  I never wrote about it because frankly there just wasnt really any differences in the data.  The only exception to that is the color of discs found.  For whatever reason, substantially more blue discs were found in the water than any other color.  Have fun speculating on that one.
  
&amp;nbsp;

**How has this changed over time?**

&amp;nbsp;

There are some neat trends here in color.  Over the past 5 years, blue and yellow discs grew more popular/found more frequently.  Blue started at 13% in 2017-18 and grew to 21% in 2021.  Yellow started at 7% and grew to 13%.  No specific color lost ground consistently - they were all pretty up and down over the years.  Blue and yellow increased every year though.

 &amp;nbsp;

**6. What type of plastic was lost most frequently?**

&amp;nbsp;

Premium Grippy (Star) - 37%

Premium Clear (Champ) - 35%

Base - 14%

Pro - 4%

Flex - 4%

Glow - 2%

Lightweight - 1%

Unknown/Unmarked - 1%

&amp;nbsp;

I know folks like to talk about DX leopards and its starter-pack kin being the most frequently found disc, but the data just isnt there for it.  Star types and Champion types duke it out for the top two slots every year in the mid 30s and base plastic never climbs out of the teens.  Everything else is a bit of a fluke to find. 
 
&amp;nbsp;

**How has this changed over time?**

&amp;nbsp;

Star-type does appear to be slowly gaining an edge on popularity over champion-type, eking a percent or two a year gain.

&amp;nbsp;

**7. What molds were most commonly lost?**

As is tradition, Ill be listing these according to the total number found instead of %.  I suppose well do a top 10 this year.

&amp;nbsp;

Destroyer - 109

Wraith - 44

Boss  - 43

Valkyrie - 36

Katana - 35

Nuke - 34

Beast - 31

Buzzz - 26

Shryke - 25

Firebird - 24

Nuke SS - 24


&amp;nbsp;

Things to note - only one mid in a list of drivers and only two non-Innova discs.

&amp;nbsp;

**How have things changed over time?**

&amp;nbsp;

In some regards they havent - the Destroyer is ALWAYS the number one disc found every year and its never a close race.  We find a LOT of Destroyers.  Beyond that, Wraiths and Nukes have been getting more popular as time progresses.  Nuke SSs had one glorious year in the sun in 2020 when we found 16 of the dang things but the other years its under 5.

We are finding a lot of Zeus and Hades.  They didnt make the list I think because they are relatively new, but theyre climbing the list fast. 

321 total unique molds were found.  Last year it was 271.

120 discs are unicorns that weve only found 1 example of.

&amp;nbsp;

**8.  What is the most common disc lost at each speed?**

&amp;nbsp;

New question this year I thought people might be interested in.  Here are the top molds found per speed.
&amp;nbsp;

1 - Berg (All one of them we found)

2 - Aviar (9)

3 - Luna (7)

4 - Zone (15)

5 - Buzzz (26)

6 - Leopard (22)

7 - ~~Eagle (9)~~  Teebird (21)

8 - Mantis (12)

9 - Valkyrie (36)

10 - Beast (31)

11 - Wraith (44)

12 - Destroyer (109)

13 - Boss (43)

14 - Colossus (12)

15 - Misselen/Racketen/Delerium (1)

&amp;nbsp;

~~Teebird came in very close for 6 speeds at 21 found.~~  Yeah, my bad - Teebird is the new speed 7 champ.  The Eagle is off crying in the corner being consoled by Barsby.  Most of the others arent too surprising, though I cant say I remember pulling out 12 Mantises.  

&amp;nbsp;

**Thoughts, Random Stats, and Musings**

&amp;nbsp;

**What do you use to retrieve discs?**

A lot of discs are just laying around.  Keeping your head on a swivel and looking for irregularities nets a surprising number.  I know a lot came from the water, but weve still discovered 200+ discs on land over 5 years - thats quite a bit of plastic!

As far as tools go, I carry a Golden Retriever variant and a Kwik-Stick in my disc golf bag.  The Kwik-Stick and M-Retrieiver are my favorite tools to use by a mile.  Fast and easy - theyre great for stuff thats 10-15 off the shoreline as well as knocking discs out of trees or reaching into briars.  My ONLY complaint about them is that the telescoping pole portion has some sort of bearings between segments that rust out within a year.  I have found periodically wiping them down with WD-40 or a similar light lubricant/water displacer does stretch their life a little - my current Kwik-Stick is on 2.5 years of heavy use but I am skeptical it will last until the end of this season.  Theyre still a great investment!

The Golden Retrievers are nice because they are so compact and they have considerably further range than the telescoping pole models.  These get used when a disc is REALLY out there and we cant quite get it with the Kwik-Stick.  They do take a little finesse and theyre not great on gnarly bottoms.  Im also not in love with re-coiling the line and shoving the wet pile back in my bag, but it is what it is.  My favorite design for these are the clawed versions.  Very frequently Ill use this and manage to snag the rim on one of the hooks as opposed to it seating properly in the bracket.  The closed box versions dont do that, obviously.

I still wade from time to time.  I usually keep a set of waders and two garden rakes in my truck.  Its amazing how many discs you can find with this setup.  I like two rakes because I find myself liking the additional support as I wade through the muck - its way too common to stumble on a log or hit a hole and having an extra stick to lean on has saved me from getting drenched.  The two rakes (I use a wide, 15 model and a short 6 model) get poked along in the muck as I wade.  Usually youll tap a disc and it transmits a distinct jolt through the handle.  Unfortunately, this jolt is very similar to feeling like wood and turtles so you do get false positives.  Trash usually isnt too bad to figure out at least.  Once I hit something promising, I try to grab it up using both rakes as a sort of claw.  It works pretty well.  My buddy swears by using the rake to scrape the top of the muck and watching for flashes of color when the rake catches the rim of a disc and it flips up.  It does work, but I think the sounding method of poking through the muck is more fruitful as it gets deeper.  Chest waders are nice for depth, but hips are easier to slip on or off.  I use a $30 pair of some generic Chinese offering.  Theyve held up very well for several years now.  Well worth the investment.

SCUBA gear is nothing fancy, though it is a full rig.  Its all analog stuff from the 90s.  The biggest thing I found to be helpful was to have a 2nd tank available and a large salvage bag.   One tank of air is worth about an hour underwater.  Not too worried about nitrogen buildup as the depth is rarely deeper than 15 or so, so two tanks of air means two hours of searching.  By the end of the 2nd hour Im pretty much bushed and ready to call it a day.  The large salvage bag is helpful because it means less surfacing.  Less time swimming up to shore to drop off goods means more time searching.  My first time trying to salvage discs I had no bag.  Turns out throwing the discs to shore in SCUBA gear is a bad plan, as is trying to hold onto a bunch of them at once with gloved hands.  Youll want a bag.

If you are thinking about getting into SCUBA to retrieve discs, temper your expectations.  Yes, you can see some discs just sitting on the surface.  Most of them are down in the muck though, sometimes several inches deep.  This means you need to feel around for them.  On top of that, when you are digging through the muck you are churning up silt like crazy.  Even if you have ok visibility to start, you lose it fast as you start moving and disturbing the bottom.  Ive never seen GOOD visibility in a water trap - 8 is pure luxury and as good as it gets.  Normally I can see 1 to 3 feet in front of my face in fresh water.  15 minutes in and visibility is usually down to about zero.  You get turned around and disoriented very, very quickly.  In many regards its a sensory deprivation experience.  Not much youre going to do about it other than continue to grope around blindly in the mud feeling for discs. 

In addition to the silt/visibility, be prepared for hazards underwater.  It SUCKS stumbling into branches and downed logs.  Super easy to get speared by the branches or have your hoses and whatnot get entangled.  Theres one localish water hazard I keep debating on diving but I keep putting off due to the amount of tree debris I can see in it.   Getting tangled in seaweed isnt much fun either.  Finding entry and egress points can also be a bear - it isnt much fun trying to get through 40 of mud in full dive gear.   Finally, last summer I got tangled up in abandoned golden retrievers a few times.  While it was nice finding retrievers, getting caught up in rope underwater is a real problem.

Anyway, its fun and I like doing it, but if youre debating on where to begin, go with a telescoping retriever for convenience while playing and a wader/rake combo to start with if youre fishing water hazards.


&amp;nbsp;

**""Do you ever find any valuable discs?""**


Im sure we do all the time.   I dont really pay attention to the secondary market though.  Im mostly interested in returning them so I dont sweat their value.

&amp;nbsp;

**""How long do discs stay lost?""**

It can be a long, long time.  Weve fished up discs that have been underwater for 5 years according to their owners.  Weve personally thrown discs in the water that we were unable to find until 2 years later.  Davey Jones does not like to relinquish his treasures.  It all depends on how far into the silt they manage to punch.  Some of the older ones were also wood finds - discs that had slipped under leaves and were subsequently buried in composting soil over the years.  Those ones are universally gross.

&amp;nbsp;

**""How do you clean a pond disc?""**

Soap, Magic Eraser, and hot water work 90% of the time.  Sometimes a bit of 220 sandpaper to clean up rough spots on any edges, not that that was caused by the water.  If there is a smell, leave it alone after cleaning for a few days.  It usually clears up on its own.  If not, put it in direct sunlight for a day or three.

Old DX/Star stuff that looks like it has absorbed dirt into its pores is uncleanable by any method Ive found.  Depending on how chewed up it is I sometimes just toss these.  Old champion takes on a yellow dinge that seems harmless but looks skuzzy.  I wonder if the plastic brightening technique some folks use on old electronics like Nintendos would bring it back.  Dont have a UV light to try it with.

&amp;nbsp;

**""How long do you hold onto discs for?""**

Theres really no set time limit.  Weve returned discs that have been sitting in our return box for over a year and a half.  Eventually we do start running out of space though and do a purge.  Typically those are the discs we found last season or earlier.  I would say that most discs that are going home to their owners are returned within a week or two of finding them, with stragglers usually being from folks who were out of town.

&amp;nbsp;

**""What is the most number of discs youve returned to a person?""**

We have a few regulars that we are always bringing stuff back to.  One regularly gets bundles of his stuff returned.  I think 6 is the most at any one time though.  Dude loses a lot of plastic.

Some discs have been returned multiple times as well.  Its sort of funny seeing the same disc lost on the same hole going back to a familiar face.  There was one blue rogue we kept pulling up time and again from the same general area in the water.  Also a teebird that had a tendency to want to go swimming.  Think both of them were returned 4 times if I remember correctly.

&amp;nbsp;

**""Do I bag any of the discs I find?""**

Yes, though Im pretty picky about what I use.  Currently I have 9 found discs in a bag of 15.  Two of those were purchased back from their owners.  The others were all uninked and we were unable to determine the owners.

My winter bag was mostly found discs as well.  Ive been using more found plastic lately I suppose.

There are some other found discs I thought were nice that I have squirreled away as well.  Stuff to grow into or backups.  All stuff we were unable to locate owners for or items we were told to keep.

&amp;nbsp;

**""Where do the discs come from?""**

Ive found discs on 27 courses.  49% come from one course though, my primary SCUBA site.  37% come from a 2nd course, my primary wading area.  So 86% of everything comes from two local courses.

&amp;nbsp;

**Closing**

Figure I have to be getting close to the character max by this point so this is as good a spot as any to wrap it up.  Is any of this information useful?  No clue, but I do think it's interesting, so  thought Id share.   Feel free to ask questions - Ill do my best to answer them.","discgolf",854,854,0,0.98,19,3,0,104

Here's a few things I learnt. I know there are a lot of people starting out here and thought it might be good to provide some of my experiences for if someone wanted to build in a new healthy habit or was struggling with motivation. 

Of course, before starting like this consider what you need, talk to a doctor. It doesn't have to be running can be powerwalking or whatever you need to start you off. I'm not an expert just a man who did a thing and bloody loved it!

***Why? Just Why?***

I started out wanting to do RED January. It's the second year I've done it, and last year it just fizzled out. And I didn't run after mid-February. 

Why run everyday? I wanted to challenge myself and push myself to keep going. I'm very much a start/stop type of person. I was massively out of shape, put on loads of weight during the pandemic, and want to show myself that I could do it. The core was building a healthy habit so that I could but on it in the future. I wanted to feel better! 

After the 31 days of January, I set the challenge to get to 50 days, then 75, and finally 100. I'm still going (missed one day because I was travelling all day) and today will be run number 111 of the year! The current goal is to get to July 2nd of the 183rd day of the year. Halfway! 

The rules were simple: in January I had to run 5km everyday. I started running 10 minutes, then 5 minutes walking, 5 minutes running, until I was at my goal. Everyday I added 1 minute of running to the start until I ran the full 5km. Then the goal was to get under 30 minutes. That took about 25 days. From then it was just get out everyday, if I felt like doing 5km I did (and this happened most days) apart from a Sunday where I ran 5 minutes longer each week until I was at 10km.

I didn't warm up (bad I know) but always started slowly for the first 10 minutes to give my body a chance to wake up and find my stride. I did always cooldown and did some stretches. 

***Some stats***

* Total runs: 100 in 100 days
* Total distance: 474 kilometers (294 miles)
* Total time: 50 hours 11 minutes
* Furthest distance: 10.26 kilometers (20th March) 
* Fastest 5km: 27:15 (19th March)
* Fastest 10km (10th April, DAY 100!)
* Largest elevation: 58 meters (20th March...flat country)
* Fastest average pace: 5:27 min/km (19th March) 
* No. of injuries: zero

***So, what did I learn?***

Many of these things will be self-explanatory for those who have ran for years. But these are my biggest takeaways. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **MOST IMPORTANT: Listen to your body:** your body knows when it's enough. I wasn't competing with anything apart from my own head. If you want to take it a slower pace that's okay. Your body will let you know what it needs. Listening to it will keep you from getting injured. Need to walk for a minute? DO IT! You can focus on endurance when your basic fitness is improved. 
* **I am able to create healthy habits:** I've never been a natural runner (asthma, weight etc) and now I can't start or finish my day without a run. It's part of my routine. As I said above, I missed a run this week for a number of reasons (mostly 10 hours driving from the UK to the Netherlands) and I missed it (but I did two runs yesterday to make up for it). 
* **Everyone can be a runner:** don't compare yourself to anyone else. You're on your own journey and you're doing it! And it feels amazing (even when those really healthy looking people overtake you!)
* **Not to push myself beyond my limits:** if it feels good. It feels good. This was about habit and slow change. I didn't want to injure myself and not be able to reach my goal. With rest days between this is different. But this wasn't about breaking records. 
* **Be kind to yourself:** having a bad day? It's okay. Get your shoes on and go. If it doesn't work out, then you've tried. 
* **Have a plan and then don't think about it:** Make a plan and then just get up and go. The days when I put off going out were the hardest. Going in the morning (and I'm terrible at waking up) meant that I didn't have time to think of excuses or stress about what happened that day. I now run on the evenings too, but I needed to have the intrinsic motivation to go from creating the habit. 
* **The first three weeks are the hardest:** your baby is adapting. And that's okay. It means you'll be sore, notice parts of your body you never think about. Embrace is and enjoy it. This was the period where I spent everyday building up. 
* **Stick to the same route:** this might be controversial. But heat me out. If you're like me and you're in your head too much, find a route that you can do. Especiially if you know it's going to be a hard one. Choose one that has even tracks and you can ideally do out and back to stay on the same side of the road (our pavements are ever so slightly slanted for water. This means that running with the road always on the same side puts pressure on certain muscles and one leg more than another. Fine for short runs but not when you do the route 100 times). Once that route becomes 'easy' and you're not counting the meters until the end, mix it up. I worked backwards and made the end new before mixing it up everyday. Now I just run wherever I want. Without stressing about how far I still have to go!
* **The right pair of shoes makes all the difference:** self-explanatory. But true. Find some good shoes (and clothes generally...thigh chaffing was a major problem because I invested in some proper boxer shorts). And proper socks! GET PROPER MOISTURE WICKING SOCKS! 
* **Your bowels will do whatever the hell they want:** there are a few very short runs in my runkeeper. And that's okay. I got up and went and had no control. 

***Would I do it again?***

I'm still going. So yes. Would I recommend doing it? It worked for me, but maybe I was lucky to stay injury free. Maybe I pushed myself too hard at times but I tried to be as sensible as possible. Maybe a 31 day goal works for others. But if you start and it's part of your routine, you'll eventually forget about the day number and focus on doing what you need to do. 

I feel amazing and healthy. I'm 33 (M) and 181cm/6ft taal. I mentioned my weight above as a reason, and I'm not where I want to be, but I'm closer. I started at somewhere between 105kg and 110kg (231lb-242lb...I was too scared to get on the scale. Last time I weight myself I was 105kg, but that was a while ago and believe I put on weight in the meantime). I'm currently at 92kg (202lb). So have lost somewhere between 13kg and 18kg since January 1st. Which is great, but wasn't the goal itself. 

*What's next?*

As I said, I'm still going. I'm currently doing a 14 week half marathon programme. That means on day 200 I'll be doing 21km. Still 7 days a week. The days that I'm not training I'm doing gentle 3km runs, just to keep myself moving.  Once that's done I think I'll move to a programme to get to 10km under 55min (maybe 50min). 

I was back visiting my parents in England last weekend and did a 10km run. I live in the famously flat Netherlands. Running 10km in 22 degree heat with hills was tough. But it's shown me the importance of mixing up my terrain. I'm going to head into the dunes more often. 

All I know is there's no stopping me now!","running",854,854,0,0.89,8,0,2,237
"https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/zrwth5/asked_my_parents_to_wear_a_mask_when_holding_my_3/","nilesinthefreezer","2022-12-21",1671647800,"Asked my parents to wear a mask when holding my 3 month old, got uninvited from Christmas","That's pretty much it. Asked for the bare minimum precautions - wear a mask and wash your hands just when you hold him. This quickly devolved into us being advised to not come over for Xmas, despite me clarifying that we didn't have an issue with coming over and the only restrictions were just when holding him. But the word ""mask"" had already triggered them and it was too late for reason. Fuck me for trying to keep my infant out of the hospital while still seeing my family for the holidays I guess. Merry Christmas to me.

Edit in defense of myself: 1. We already reduced our Xmas gatherings to whoever would be offended the most if we stayed home and whoever wouldn't have young children around since they go to school and daycare. 2. Our baby starts daycare in a few weeks, and at that point he will almost definitely get RSV etc. So the goal is to reduce risk while we still have a choice. 3. We are not trying to keep him in a bubble, but the facts are he is 3 months old and things are very bad right now with RSV, flu, and COVID. 3. I'm a human being and still want to see family at xmas. Seeing them in small groups and asking for a mask and hand washing when holding him felt like a compromise we could live with. Yes it doesn't remove all risk but keeping people from kissing him or sneezing/coughing on him when that close takes a big chunk out of the risk. It's been working so far. If I had my way we would stay home forever and require proof of vaccines. But I know I can't live like that so this is the middle ground I decided on. 3. My dad specifically said in his response that he will not wear a mask in his own house and suggested we just stay home, so it was all about the mask. He had the option to just not hold him, which is what he chose at first, but as I said, things devolved. And 4. Yes, this was a suggestion from my doctor. Who went to med school. And is a doctor.

Edit 2: I appreciate the kind words. I'm the only child doing any kind of precautions with my baby so I feel like the odd man out in my family. It's nice to not feel crazy.

Edit 3: people are getting very stuck on the while holding him thing. Cripes. Ok, that was the language I chose to use because I knew saying anything about 6 feet would further enrage my father who is triggered by any pandemic terminology. While holding him is a good way to get the point across to not be close unless you have a mask on while avoiding a forbidden phrase. Unfortunately there was no way to avoid saying the word mask. I also understand that it will still be in the air across the room. I'm not an idiot.  That was the risk we were willing to accept. Wearing a mask in close proximity keeps bodily fluids off my child, reduces the increase in risk that comes when he is closer to someone, and keeps people from kissing him or touching their own hands to their mouth etc. I also would like to say that we only started asking people to do this when rsv and flu picked up, so I'm not some mask crazy nutjob.  Would I prefer everyone to have a mask on all the time in the same room as my baby? Yes. Am I making people do that? No. I'm finding middle ground and am being quite reasonable. So please stop speaking to me as if I'm an idiot who hasn't thought a very long time about the best way to handle this for our family. I also think I'm allowed to feel sad about now having to miss seeing my parents for Xmas when it didn't have to be this way. 

Edit 4: I say this on behalf of anyone else in the same situation as me. If one more person says ""If you're that worried about it..."" to me I am absolutely going to lose it. Those were also my father's exact words to me today. It's dismissive, insulting, and creates a false black and white choice between all or nothing. If I have any reasonable concern about RSV and want to do something simple to reduce but not eliminate the risk I should just stay home? No in between huh? That's the kind of throw the baby out with the bathwater mindset that got me my uninvitation. =M

Edit 5: this keeps coming up so I want to address it. Yes, I am aware that he will get sick when he starts daycare in a few weeks. Unfortunately we don't have a choice in that. We can't afford to live on one income and our leave is up. I don't see though how this means we're silly for trying to avoid illness right now. Babies grow so fast and giving him a few more weeks to grow and get stronger before he's slammed with viruses doesn't seem silly to me.


Final edit and then I'll peace out: first, thank you for the overwhelming supportive response. I read every single comment, and thank you from the bottom of my heart for taking time to say something kind. Happy holidays to you all! One last thing I want to clarify. I did not demand they wear masks in their own home during a party. I simply let them know we're having people wear masks when holding the baby right now. We were planning to visit just with the two of them, and I was giving them a heads up ahead of time. They initially said they just won't hold him, then it turned into why dont you just not visit us for the rest of flu season if you're so worried. I never mandated they wear a mask at their own house. They would only have had to put one on near the baby during our visit. They had the option to just not hold him. >7@","beyondthebump",855,855,0,0.89,3,0,0,422

It's a bit buried in the replies, so I thought I'd repost it here for a wider audience since the question still comes up a lot and maybe this will help bring closure. Here it is:

It really just came down to it being a time for a change, for everyone. We had been working very hard for a long time on Beats Music and I was invested in my role as creative director there. When Apple bought Beats, TR stayed on to work on Apple Music, but there wasnt a place for me at Apple, it wasnt a good fit and it was far away from the cool creative startup energy that we had at Beats. TR was focused on Apple, soundtracks, and family, NIN was dormant and did not need a full-time salaried art director, I was very distracted with some personal shit I was going through and frankly needed a big life change, and it was just the right time.

From an outside perspective people are like why wouldnt he still be with NIN?? but that was fifteen years of my life, from my freshmen year of college, my entire adult career, and it wasnt just a job it was an ALL-consuming, 24/7 way of life. At a certain point I craved my own thing, I didnt want to be giving my everything to someone elses brand, for lack of a better word, no matter how much I liked it or believed in it. I had an amazing time with NIN that grew me as an artist and a person in ways nothing else could have, and it built me a name and a fanbase and a launching point for new opportunities. I had my dream job beyond dream jobs, an opportunity of a thousand lifetimes, and Im so grateful for it. But at the end of it, I was on a salary and I walk away owning none of the work I did for my entire career \[people seem to think I earn royalties for my NIN work, but I do not receive royalties of any kind\].

There were many times when I felt I should probably move on from NIN to carve out my own brand/identity, but I always ended up staying because the NIN/HTDA projects were so FUN and CHALLENGING. Then I thought the Year Zero TV show would be something I could have a bigger stake in and launch my own career, but then the project didnt happen, and I thought the same thing with Beats, then that project changed, and the feeling that I was running out of time to make my own way in the world was getting hard to ignore. So I know it can seem hard to believe but even at a dream job you can get burnout! Compound that with personal life burnout, and it just really became necessary for everything to change.

Its taken me a while to reconfigure (like I said, working for NIN was my entire adult life/career, Ive never known anything else), but now Im in a different sort of dream job, I have a bazillion ideas for my own things and am having a blast making stuff that I own now. Trent was my best friend for years, family really, and will always be - we were just emailing recently about my impending fatherhood. I havent been back to LA for a proper visit in five years, but will definitely connect with TR when I get down there. Id love to work with him on something in the future, Im sure something will come along.

Right now though, I love that I get to wake up every day and make whatever I want, and have an incredible fanbase that supports my work. Ive taken myself far away from the glamour and money and parties and prestige that came with my NIN career in LA, and Im so weirdly happy about it, Ive found a type of contentment in my life now that I simply didnt know was possible. People ask me why I dont do what I did for NIN with other bands, and the answer is I simply dont want to. What I had with NIN was a very special creative synergy, its not something I can ever see replicating elsewhere. It was freeing to realize that I am so much more content making projects of my own, even on a small scale, than I would be making tour visuals for Metallica or whatever.

And in addition to my own new projects, its also been fun having the time and clarity to actually go back through my work with NIN, reflecting on it, and talking about it with fans in a way I was never able to before. Everything was always moving so fast back then, I was wearing so many hats and doing such an intense volume of work, there was never any time to even stop and breathe and sit with the work. I never got much of a chance to expand upon that work and make it a part of my identity as an artist until HTDA, which is why that body of work is so special to me. But now I get to reflect on, for example, my With Teeth artwork, and realize I had so much more to say there that I can continue now. So that led me to create a whole body of new work called digital horizons using the same methods and hardware. Ive been sitting on that stuff for two years now thinking I would debut it in a gallery show but then the pandemic happened, and now I have a baby on the way, so I think Ill be debuting that work online soon and figure out a gallery show later. I think youll all really like it if you like my With Teeth stuff.

Thanks for continuing to follow my post-NIN career and for all the immense kindness and support I get from the NIN community. I came from the NIN online fandom, its been a big part of my life since I was 15, so no matter how far away I find myself from NIN yall will always be like family to me. You can take the boy out of the NIN, but Ive found you cant take the NIN out of the boy.","nin",836,836,0,0.99,8,1,0,62

**Religious Anons:**

These people are ""true believers"", basically fundamentalist Christians who believe that stuff like the end times and rapture is coming. They believe trump is a messiah or working with Jesus Christ or that Jesus Christ is coming back or is already back. They believe in the mark of the beast and that the vaccines are related to it, somehow inserting trackers in your body or something to that nature. These are your bible-thumping republicans, the people you would expect to be trump supporters and believe in Q anon.

How to spot them- They say stuff like ""there's a storm coming"", ""its all going to be over soon"", they have hard-core right-wing authoritarian beliefs and are die-hard republicans. They tend to skew older and post on facebook a lot. They may have been mainstream republicans prior to 2016 but got radicalized and believe all sorts of extreme stuff now.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conspiracy Anons:**

These people are extreme skeptics. This is the largest umbrella of beliefs, some of which are so ridiculous its impossible to logically understand them. This group is firmly anti science and only gets information from extremely fringe sources. Believes in stuff like false flags, crisis actors, controlled opposition. They could believe in anything from flat earth, to space not being real, the moon landing being fake etc.  They tend to believe the pandemic is a bioweapon to depopulate the world. They might also believe in something about 5G. They might also believe in lizard people and/or aliens that are having some kind of interdimensional battle for your soul. Its really just a huge grab bag of ideas.

How to spot them: Say stuff like ""Both sides are controlled by the reptilians"", ""Everyone is sheep, only i know that nothing is real"", ""its all one big illusion, its deeper than you know"".  Their theories are always extremely convoluted or vague and hard to understand. They watch alex jones or David icke or other fringe news sources. They probably never supported republicans until recently when the pandemic happened.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pastel Anons:**

&amp;#x200B;

These are the hippy/new-age type people you wouldn't expect to be trump supporters at all. In fact, a lot of them are far left or socialist on the political spectrum but they are so deep in the conspiracy theories that they've swung the other way. They think that events like the pandemic are rooted in astrology and everything is planned out in order to bring about a new age of aquarius. They often believe in negative entities but sometimes the negative entities are actually secretly good because the chaos and death is like a ""cleansing"". Believe in occult and hidden texts, hermeticism , gnosticism etc.and they believe that the elites have hidden spiritual knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

How to spot them: Refer to elites as ""the cabal"" or ""the inorganic ones"" and believe that they are spiritual entities trying to cause chaos. Skews toward a younger crowd. They often watch stuff like ancient aliens and often follow a vegan diet. essential oils, and alt medicine are common. Tend to use weed, and psychedelics . Beliefs in spirituality, spiritual entities, new-age, gnosticism, astrology etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Carnivore Anons:**

&amp;#x200B;

This group is pretty unique but tends to have a lot of overlap with q groups. They believe humans are meant to eat raw meat and only the most elite people know this. They think veganism is a secret agenda to depopulate the world. They think eating meat and drinking blood gives you super powers. They believe the elites eat babies and drink their blood. This is where a lot of the blood sucking vampire conspiracies originated from and also organ harvesting/adrenochrome.

How to spot them; they believe in eating raw meat, its pretty easy to spot them. they are completely against main stream medicine and science. They also tend to practice ""sungazing"" which is just staring directly at the sun for long periods of time.","QAnonCasualties",809,809,0,0.98,3,0,0,217

hi everyone! thank you for all the advice and other fun, interesting things you've said.

we are an asian household and in as much as i want to be firm with her and tell her off or explain it to her, it is considered being disrespectful if i start being firm with my boundaries because 1. i am living in her house 2. she is older than me ,, yeah that's how things work in this place. 

partner and i already talked that if we be firm with his mother, she will take it so much against us. she will be maaaaaad. 

plus, she takes LO with her in her room everyday saying they should have their time too. that lasts about an hour or so and she'll give LO back to me in case she needs to be fed or changed. 

there are also times where we go someplace and she wants to be the one carrying LO around. ugh. she forces me to take a timeout when i don't feel the need for one. 

i feel like i am already saying too much i'm sorry this is the only place where i can vent like this.","JUSTNOMIL",787,787,0,0.97,0,0,0,176

While most people that find this information out are surprised that a doctor would perform a surgery on a man at such a young age, it wasn't that easy and it was a decision that my wife at the time and I made together after looking at all of our options.  Unfortunately for us we decided that we were better off friends and not husband and wife so a little over a year down the road we went our own ways in life. 

Fast forward 10 years and I meet my current wife! After two years of dating we got married. Me (36M) and my wife (33F) have been married for 3 years now. When we first started talking, before we even started dating, one of the first things I let her know was that I was fixed and kids were not something I saw in my future. She and I were on the same page as she did not want kids either so we moved forward with a relationship. After we got engaged we started talking about how we would be great parents if it were possible to have a baby. Those conversations turned into looking into getting a vasectomy reversal after we got married to see if we could conceive naturally. We followed through with this decision after we married I got a reversal so we had nothing standing in our way to prevent us from having a baby. 

After the reversal all of my test came back with astounding numbers so there was no concern that the reversal did not work, however we were not getting pregnant. During all of this my wife had been in communication with one of her best friends who was having issues conceiving naturally as well. She took it upon herself to become our ""coach"" if you would. We went months with her friend providing us with different ideas and suggestions from switching up prenatal pills, having my wife test her pee to get her ovulation cycle timing, lying in bed after with her feet up, scheduling sex. It kind of started to get weird when the constant texting that consisted of it's time to have sex, ""reminders""  to have sex again at 3:03am, but she was excited for us so we gave it a go. I/we appreciate her friends knowledge and advice greatly and luckily for my wife's friend, she and her husband were able to conceive during this time. Naturally this was exciting for everyone, but this was also pretty disappointing for my wife that we were doing all of the same things she was doing and suggesting, yet here we were month after month and still nothing. This was all pretty exhausting and slowly the romance and the fun in having sex started to feel like a chore for both of us. It also started to build a bit of tension between my wife and I. In addition to my wife's best friend that was able to conceive, a lot of her other friends also started getting pregnant at this time as well.  Outside of our ""scheduled"" times, sex was becoming non-existent. During all of this the conversation of IUI's and IVF's came up. I always made it clear to my wife that I did not want to go this route. In fact I highly suggested that something must be wrong with one of us that we need to find out because there is no real reason we are not supposed to conceive, or maybe it's just not in our cards. Each time this conversation came up it led to a fight because my wife made it clear to point out the fact that we paid thousands of dollars to get a reversal so it's only fair if we venture down this path for her. Again, having a baby was something I was okay with now that I was married to the love of my life, but not something I wanted my world to revolve around and honestly not something I wanted to pile more debt on before having&.. Because children are expensive. To add, we had just built a home after getting married, the pandemic started and most importantly, we as a married couple were not in a good place, however we decided to see what her OBGYN had to say.

The OBGYN started us off with a booster shot and she had to take a round of clomid. I had taken clomid from the day of my reversal and was still taking at this time. For me it was a half a pill every other day, however for my wife they gave her a lot at once, which made her extremely sick to her stomach it actually made me not want us to move forward with any further fertility treatment but we did. They decided next to have us do an IUI, in addition to the shot and the clomid. If I am not mistaken we did an IUI with this doctor three times in total with 4 total rounds of Clomid and a booster shot. I'll be honest, COVID did not help the situation as we were not allowed to go to the appointments together, so it felt like a production line and took any and all of the sexy out. It's not fun for the husband nor the wife when you find yourself driving into the doctor's office to jerk off into a cup then text your wife when you leave because they need her there in the next hour after they wash it. She leaves the house to go to the same place I just left, they insert a tube inside of her and she sits there for 10 minutes with her legs in the air, then you sit and wait. Mind you, at the time her insurance nor mine covered anything fertility related, so all of this was coming out of our savings. At this point my wife decided that the OBGYN, while doing their job, was only able to do so much so she sought out the expertise of a professional so she scheduled an appointment to see a fertility specialist. The fertility specialist told us she would attempt one IUI, however if this did not work she would want to move to IVF. For me this is where I drew the line. As always the conversation turned into an argument and I agreed that we would we would try one last IUI. I told my wife that at this point I do not even want to hear about kids or anything fertility related for a while and I want to focus on us and getting us back to where we used to be, in love. We moved on with our lives for a few months with no mention of children or fertility treatments. During this time people would ask us ""How's getting pregnant going"" and it would drive the wedge between us deeper and deeper. 

Fast forward a few months and my wife has a new job with insurance that does include some fertility treatment costs. This has brought her desire to want to have children back on the table. Money really wasn't the issue, but sure the coverage would be nice. Since the start of her new job I do feel that our marriage has started to head in the right direction, that was up until a few weeks ago. The topic of having children came up and naturally turned into an argument. The following day my wife asked if we can sit down and talk about our future and we did. During this conversation she told me that I need to decide if I want children because she is going to have a baby weather I am involved or not and if I do not want a baby there is really no point in us being together and we should get divorced. 

I really don't know what to do here. Going through everything we went through with the fertility was enough to break a relationship but we've stuck it out for what I thought was love. I know that I do not want to lose my wife, but I also know that clearly we are not in a good place right now to have children and she has no issues going and getting an IVF with a random donor. I understand she has a biological clock and I also don't want to be the one that takes that away. I am really at a loss....","Marriage",792,792,0,0.95,0,0,0,690

Our son was due during the height of RSV season and we were already at risk due to our first born being in grade school and it running rampant this year; not to mention the literal pandemic. 

3 weeks before I gave birth, my husband started showing signs of getting sick. We went and got some rapid tests done and we were both positive. I was devastated. I was so worried about giving birth sick and tired and worried about giving it to baby. Luckily by my due date I was feeling better and had a successful delivery. 

But a day before my induction my MIL called us and asked when she should make the drive up with her husband and adult daughter to wait for me to deliver. Mind you that even if we hadnt told them WEEKS in advanced we werent entertaining visitors for the first few weeks hospitals in our area arent allowing any visitors; not even our first born was allowed to meet their sibling until we came home. So obviously Im bewildered and my SO feels put on the spot but we tell her again and shes very clearly butt hurt, like we were going to just change our minds because she sprung it up on us last minute. 

Fast forward two weeks and she calls us again to put her foot down about seeing the baby this weekend or next. Even though I told her initially I wanted to wait for his two month shots, then we made plans with them for Christmas which hed only be a month old then. But she says its been long enough; I think I get to see my grandchild now. I was floored. What right does she think she has to my baby? She was clearly putting her wishes over the health of our baby; and then the worst happened. 

Our first born brought home RSV and our newborn caught it. We were in and out of the ER the next two weeks with even more sleepless nights than usual with a newborn. I could hardly sleep, hearing your fresh baby cough like a smoker and gasp for air is something I wouldnt wish on anyone and we kept both sides of our family in the loop about his status. Obviously we didnt have anyone visit for Christmas as we had two sick babies and even caught it ourselves. 

Flash forward to now. (Im sorry this is so long; thank you for reading this far haha) We rescheduled their visit to two weekends from now, only to find out that theyve had COVID this entire time. FIL accidentally spilled the beans to our first born, so they still dont know we know. So when my MIL put her foot down she was already sick and coughing (I heard her on the phone sniffling and coughing) but hadnt been tested yet and then my FIL caught it as well. My husband and I are pissed and I think rightfully so. What do you guys think our next course of action should be? How should we confront them, and how long should we keep them from visiting?

This is my first Reddit post, I apologize in advance if its obvious.

If this isnt the kind of content that is allowed here, feel free to remove it.

My wife and I were always perfect for each other. You dont need the whole story, but we were perfect enough that we decided we should get married and were happy until we had our baby. We would occasionally fight, we would have disagreements, but things were always resolved in a way that works for everyone. We got married 5 years ago and 18 months ago welcomed our baby into this world. We were so happy when she got pregnant, she suffers with PCOS, so conceiving is difficult, but she really wanted a baby and we got lucky. While my wife was pregnant, she started to display strange behaviour. She became so aggressive verbally with me and my family that they all began to believe that she hated them. It got so bad that her attacks on my brother drove him to a mental health crisis of his own. I tried to insulate her from them, believing that they were somehow causing trouble for her. We would go to dinner with my family, and she would seem fine, but after we left, she would tell me some story about how my brother said something terribly hurtful to her when I wasnt around. At first, I believed her, but there were times she would say that someone had said something hurtful, and I was in the room and didnt hear anything said. I believed that this strange and aggressive behaviour was due to covid stress (this was still early in the pandemic), coupled with late pregnancy. I suggested she see someone, and I would come with her if she wanted for support, but she accused me of thinking she was crazy and refused to go. 

When the baby arrived things got better, or at least, things got busier. Everyone here knows the insane cacophony that comes with a newborn, especially as it was our first. This is when her strange behaviour started to expand. She would get aggressive verbally and make claims that didnt make sense. She would claim that I had tricked her into things that we discussed at length earlier, or that I had not informed her of large life decisions that we both made together. For example, we discussed for weeks a move to a new home with more space that would cost us more per month. Then after the move, months later, she claimed that I had forced her to move because I wanted a bigger place and now, she didnt have money to do things she wanted to. I tried to make her calm, or happy, I thought that she was just overworked and overtired, so I took on more housework to offset the busy baby schedule. And I make sure that she gets two nights off a week for her gym time (this is true today, she gets Mondays and Wednesdays off for whatever she wants to do).

Fast forward about 18 months and things have gotten progressively worse. I have no idea what emotional state she will be in anymore, random things seem to trigger her into a blinding rage, today I spent some time catching up with a neighbor outside and received an hour-long screaming fit for it. She claimed that I dont speak to her that long anymore so I must be using this neighbor to avoid her. I am part of a large work text group, so I often receive messages with no contact name, just a phone number. When this happens, shell say something like who is really texting you all the time? and ask about my female coworkers. She does nothing in our house anymore, that isnt an exaggeration. I handle the finances, the cleaning, the cooking, the babys mornings and bedtimes, the bath time for the kid, all his meals, he stays with me in my work office during the day, etc. Her only chore is doing her own laundry, so I dont ruin her clothing. When she is mad at me, which is often, she tells me to be careful because in a divorce she would take the kid, the dog, my paycheque for the next 18 years and the house. Im not sure how true that is but the thought utterly guts me. Its like shes checked out and waiting for me to fire her so she can get her severance pay.

When she does spend time with our son, such as when I must go to the bathroom or if she needs to feed him while I clean something, I can hear it almost immediately takes on an angry tone with him. Shell start yelling come on! or for gods sake! while he makes a mess or goes somewhere he isnt allowed to. Anytime I bring up counselling or care for her it goes right away to me thinking shes insane or that I am somehow gaslighting her into thinking that something is wrong with her. In her mind I am a mean man who bosses her around and isnt grateful for everything she does, but honestly, I dont know what she does? She had minor surgery about 5 weeks ago, and was in bed for 4 days, those 4 days I had to do everything and honestly noticed no difference from my regular day to day activities (other than the fact that I was yelled at less). 

I fear that a divorce is inevitable, but Im terrified of what that means for my son and future. My boss wants me to return to in person work, but I am honestly scared of what will happen if I leave my stay-at-home wife alone to watch our son. I dont think shed ever hit him, but I do know that the odd time she must make him food she just drives to the coffee shop and gives him a donut to eat. I keep making up reasons to stay virtual but eventually it will have to happen. I dont know how this happened to my life, I feel like I made every right choice along the way and somehow ended up in hell. 

My wife puts in no effort to our relationship. I suggested that we do a date night once a week, dedicated to the other person on a rotating basis. So, week one I would spoil her, week two she would spoil me and so on. On my week I researched massage methods, picked up a foot bath and oils, I massaged and cleaned her feet and her body, gave her an at home spa day, even painted her toenails for her. Her week for me? I dont know& pick a movie we can watch on the couch.

When did my hardworking, caring, loving wife become this spiteful, disinterested, lazy women who does not work, but expects the world and is mad at me for trying to provide it to her? Its like she fooled me into believing she was one woman, until she had a baby, and now she can reveal her true nature because she knows I wont leave her.

I am so lost in the dark I dont even recognize my life anymore.

I cannot express how much your words of support truly mean to me, I've read every message and found a lot of comfort in this community and your supportive words. I will speak to a lawyer, and I think it's time for a harsher conversation with my wife regarding her health, and if our relationship continues, how she must be taking care of it.

So I work as a security guard near aldgate east station. I just got off my 13 hour shift and walked across the street to where the building was on fire last last week, to withdraw some cash. while walking up to the cash machine, I tried to phone my wife but she was busy with the baby so didn't answer. 

I started crossing the street and checked my pockets and my phone was gone. I couldn't believe it. It couldn't of even been 2 mins since I made the call to my wife.

I kept thinking I must of dropped it. But it wasn't possible. My phone was swiped while at the cash point.

I frantically paced up and down aldgate east Tesco hoping it fell and was kicked across the floor, or maybe people would leave it. I work in security and know better. 

I started heading towards tower bridge and found my phone case in the middle of road. I accepted my phone was stolen and just kept thinking about my wife's pregnancy journey and all my baby photos. I felt like shit. I ended up walking to bermondsey thinking how I would need to cancel everything(phone, online banking, passwords ). And how much more broke I will be after buying a new phone.

2 hours later I finally get home.

I opened the door and my wife had a murderous look in her eyes. She told me someone had found my phone near Liverpool st station and was happy to return it. I did not go anywhere near Liverpool st station. So I'm confused how it ended up there. 

I ended up meeting, the stranger the next day. I literally could not afford to thank him. I'm still waiting to get paid. My company has messed up my payslips to the point where they owe me so much money I might actually make this my last week.

so all I could afford was a box of £4 Lindt chocolates.
I sort of do freelance illustrations and stuff. So I offered the guy free logos animation or whatever. He probably thinks I'm insane.

I told him he was mad for returning my phone. I wasn't emotionally ready for that kind of kindness and I'm still not over it. I really wish I could repay the guy but he was like nah it's cool. 

Last few years have been horrible. I used to work security for movies and work alongside bodyguards. My bodyguard mate who used to get me work died of cancer a few weeks ago. He was the reason I had a job working with the NHS nightingale during the pandemic. I have two photos of him on my phone and I felt like shit for losing them. 

My wife is now on my case like a hawk and is certain I have adhd. And the weather is amazing today and I feel so good.

The past 2 years have been dreadful, downright dreadful, the natural disasters have gotten worse, the Pandemic has killed millions and now a freaking war has started. All i can say is i am so glad i decided that i am never having children, never putting another human being through the pain of this world, not risking another life to a sudden death from disease or war, not having to answer complicated questions as my teens begin to question what their adult life will be like and how they will cope. I won't have to do any of those things because i don't have any children,and i have never felt more proud of my decision than i have now. It makes me question if the people having kids now were even awake these past two years, how could they watch a world collapse in front of them and still think it was a good idea to bring a baby into it? Who knows what their future will be like, housing prices are going up, bills are getting harder and harder to afford, the school system is going down hill, poverty is getting more common, natural disasters are taking more and more lives every day, Scientists predict more epidemics and pandemics will appear and could be worse than Covid, Student loans are possibly being taken away or changed  (in my country) 

The truth is the future is questionable for all of us but i fear for this young generation, the ones that were brought into the world when people knew it was bad but kept going because they only thought of themselves . I am still quite young myself and i have decided that i don't want to inflict another human life to this world, it has got so much worse in the past 10 years and doesn't seem to be getting any better, in fact its getting worse. So to my non existent children, i will not bring you here, to this world, to suffer, to fight, to fake a smile, instead i will keep you unborn, away from all this pain, suffering, and fight, i love you too much to bring you into this world, you would probably be great but i can't let this world scar you with the things its scarred me with, i can't bring you here where safety is questionable and life is an unpredictable uncertainty.

I didn't expect my mess of a story to get such a reaction! Thank you everyone for the comments and upvotes. I've attached an update to the bottom of the post to try and follow up on some things.  
TL;DR: Player invites girlfriend to game, she tries to flirt with the DM and then cheats with another player, ruining two friendships and destroying my group.

This is a story about how my last ttrpg group fell apart due to players not respecting personal boundaries. I'm using a throwaway account as I know some of the people involved read Reddit and I don't want to incite (or be on the receiving end of) resulting drama.

For ease of reference, the cast is as follows:  
\- **Me**: your dear writer and forever DM. Ttrpg fanatic who has been running various systems for 10+ years, including D&amp;D, Call of Cthulhu, World of Darkness and Shadowrun.  
\- **Bard**: a close family friend of mine. We've known each other for over 10 years and are still in regular contact after this story.  
\- **Cleric**: a mutual friend of mine and Bard's, who soon becomes a close friend of mine due to the enthusiasm he displays in D&amp;D.  
\- **Paladin**: another of Bard's friends. Best friend of 3 years to Cleric and, before long, a good friend of mine.  
\- **Rogue**: Paladin's girlfriend, who joins the game later. Used to be a fashion model and is completely new to the world of ttrpgs.  
\- **Ranger**: A friend of Cleric's from work, who joins the game at the same time as Rogue.

Our story begins in late 2019. I, a veteran forever DM of multiple game systems, am approached by my long time friend Bard asking if I'd like to run a D&amp;D 5th edition game for him and a few of our mutual friends, who have always been interested in D&amp;D but never had the chance to play. It's been a while since I've had a regular group, so I jump at the chance, and being able to introduce some of my closest friends to a hobby that's very important to me sounds like an excellent time.

Bard hosts our first few games at his house, and I meet and quickly become friends with Cleric and Paladin as they take to the game like naturals and we spend many hours outside of the game bonding over video games, music and nerd stuff. The group also includes my best friend of 20 years (playing a gnome Wizard) and another one of Bard's friends (playing a drow Fighter), though these two aren't relevant to the events to come and are only mentioned for the sake establishing our original group of four. As most of the players are new to D&amp;D, and I am new to 5th edition (having only ran 3.5) I run the group through Lost Mines of Phandelver, and we have a fantastic time overall.

Then, 2020 rolls around and with it comes the pandemic. Lockdowns begin and we can no longer meet at Bard's house to play in person. This doesn't end up being a problem, as I quickly work out how VTTs work and set up a Discord so we can play online. Freed from the restriction of having to drive from all over the state to meet up physically, we even end up playing every week as opposed to only having a session every fortnight. Everyone is having a great time and playing ttrpgs keeps us all sane during the pandemic. After a while, Bard, Cleric and Paladin even become interested in games other than D&amp;D, so I end up running other games on alternating weeks such as Call of Cthulhu and even a bit of Vampire: The Masquerade. Everything seems to be going well, and being all friends in real life, our group gels fantastically and has a bare minimum of drama.

It's after a few months of playing online that two things happen that will spell the eventual doom of the group and the destruction of years long friendships. The first is that Cleric begins to talk to a coworker about our adventures and, excited to try ttrpgs, that coworker asks if he can join us some time. The second is that Paladin's girlfriend, who has spent the last few months ""listening to our sexy voices"" (her words) wants to finally join our game. I've been enjoying my time with the group and in my mind, more people could only mean more fun times, so I welcome both of these newcomers, and Ranger and Rogue soon become valued members of the group. Sadly, it's here where things start to go wrong, but definitely not in a way I expected.

The first red flag shows itself when Rogue asks me for build advice for her character. Being new to the game and wanting to be a helpful DM I oblige her, and we start talking on Facebook. After a while, the subject of these conversations changes from D&amp;D to other nerd stuff and soon life in general. I start to value Rogue as a friend and every now and then we spend hours talking to each other about our lives and problems and just generally being there for each other. Several times, Rogue mentions that it was our ""sexy voices"" that got her interested in joining our game, and she says a number of things to me that are borderline creepy (such as asking what I, as a married man, think about polyamorism or showing me pictures of when she was a model and asking me if I found them attractive). At this point, I feel it's important to specify that I am actually asexual, and so the innuendo is lost on me and I don't really think anything of it until my wife points it out to me. Now realising that Rogue is flirting with me and not wanting to lead her on, I tell her that I'm happily married and don't want to come between her and Paladin, and thankfully our conversations return to normal afterwards. I still value her as a friend and, thinking I've nipped a problem in the bud, I put these anomalies out of my mind and life continues on.

The second red flag appears a few months later, when I notice Ranger and Rogue flirting with each other in game. This upsets Paladin a little, as being new to the hobby, he still sometimes as problems separating in character interactions from out of character interactions. I immediately lay down some rules for the group stating that romancing other player characters is off limits, as not everyone is comfortable with it, and both Rogue and Ranger agree to tone things down and soon move onto romancing NPCs instead. It's at this point that Ranger comes to me to apologise, thinking he'd done something wrong. I tell him that no, nothing is wrong, it's just important sometimes to set boundaries as not everybody treats the game with the same level of seriousness. He seems to understand this, and casually mentions that he has been talking to Rogue out of game, getting to know her, and that she thought it would be a fun plotline for their characters. He states that Rogue being Paladin's girlfriend in real life shouldn't come into it, and that he and Rogue just wanted to act out a storyline. While I agree with him that Paladin should learn to separate the game from real life, I tell Ranger that I'm erring on the side of caution so that nobody is uncomfortable in game. He says he understands, and I move on, feeling happy that I've resolved something and kept my group intact.

We keep playing for a while, and while there's now a little bit of tension between Paladin and Ranger, it doesn't get to a point that disrupts the game. Then, suddenly, everything comes to a head in mid 2021. I'm getting ready to begin the next day's session when I receive a message from Paladin - he won't be able to make it to the game and isn't sure when he'll feel up to playing again. Sensing that something is obviously wrong (both Cleric and Paladin were the two players in my group who had *never* missed a session up until that point and looked forward to game day every week) I asked him what had happened. Paladin tells me that Rogue has just broken up with him because she's being seeing someone else, and he is so shocked he couldn't possibly work up the energy to play. I'm not sure what to do, so I just tell him to take the time he needs and if he feels up to it, he's welcome to join us anyway. He thanks me for my offer, but tells me he'll need some time before he can play a game with Rogue in it, as he doesn't want either of them to bring their out of game drama into the game.

So, I'm feeling a bit put out by this bombshell, being down a player and being concerned for both Paladin and Rogue. But Bard, Cleric and Ranger are all still keen to play so I go ahead and run the weekly session as per normal. It feels rather strange without Paladin there, and I can't help noticing that Rogue and Ranger have started flirting in character again. Paladin isn't there to feel uncomfortable, I figure, so I caution them to be careful and to remember our rule, but basically leave them to it after a while, being blissfully unaware that everything is about to go wrong next session.

The next week's session comes around, and Cleric and I have spent a lot of time consoling Paladin, eventually convincing him to come and play with us. We make a promise that both he and Rogue will be civil to each other and that everyone is just there to play a game (and I recognise now, long after these events, that this was my mistake - by putting these two people together in game I was only inviting drama, but at the time I thought I was just making sure my group ran smoothly and trying to maintain business as usual). Paladin joins the session, and we're right into a dungeon crawl. There's some slight tension between Paladin and Rogue but for the most part, the session is going smoothly and everyone is enjoying working on the puzzles and sneaking around the monsters I've carefully placed. Then for some reason, Ranger starts acting extremely competitive, trying to one up everything Paladin's character does, and constantly belittling his decisions both in and out of character. He starts bragging about how he's dealt more damage this session than Paladin, or how he and Rogue work much better as a team than Paladin and Cleric do. This obviously gets to Paladin, who is already in a bad frame of mind and is essentially only there because Cleric and I forced him.

Sensing some drama brewing, I stop the game and tell Ranger that he's being disruptive and warn him that if he doesn't stop needling Paladin I'll end the session and kick him from the group. Suddenly, Rogue loudly exclaims that she doesn't care about Paladin's feelings and that ""he's just acting like a baby"" and that if I was going to kick Ranger she would be leaving as well. I'm confused at this point, so I reiterate that attacking each other out of character is not tolerated in my game and ask why she would be so offended by me telling Ranger to tone it down. That's when Ranger drops the bombshell on all of us: *he is Rogue's new boyfriend and has been dating her for at least a month*.

This single revelation destroys the entire group in a matter of minutes. Paladin quits in a haze of anger and hatred, humiliated by Rogue and Ranger. Cleric is disgusted in Ranger's behaviour and leaves to support his best friend. Obviously I have no choice but to end the session, so I disconnect from voice chat and try to figure out how to process this mess. Rogue comes to me apologising for Ranger's behaviour but insisting they ""both did nothing wrong"". I ask her what would make her think belittling Paladin in such a way right after they broke up was acceptable. Her response is to tell me why she broke up with Paladin in the first place - apparently, she is polyamorous and saw nothing wrong with dating Ranger while still in a relationship with Paladin, and when Paladin discovered what she'd been doing ""he wouldn't accept that she was poly"" and so she broke up with him. I didn't quite know what to say to this, so I just said that I accepted that she had her reasons and it was none of my business. My hope was that, given enough time, people would start to cool down and we could move on.

It's almost uncanny how swiftly the aftermath unfolds and destroys any faint hope of salvaging anything from this mess. Over the course of the next 48 hours, Paladin ends up having a mental break down, tries to kill himself by downing an entire packet of paracetamol and makes graphic death threats to both Ranger and Rogue that result in him being visited by the police, taken to hospital to have his stomach pumped, and then committed to the mental ward for a few days. Paladin tells Cleric that he resents him for bringing Ranger into the group, and Cleric (understandably) cuts ties with Paladin due to this and his quite frankly scary behaviour towards Ranger and Rogue after the fact. Ranger feels a little guilty after everything happens, and offers to keep playing with me, but neither me, Cleric or Bard feel up to it. Rogue insists that she did nothing wrong and that everything was just a ploy on Paladin's part for attention.

This all happened about a year ago now. There's a bit more to the story, but this post is long enough as it is and it mostly seems irrelevant compared to what happened between Paladin, Ranger and Rogue. I did intend to start a new game with Bard and Cleric and a couple of our friends, but shortly after this all happened, I was diagnosed with a chronic illness and unfortunately in the few months I took to come to terms with that and begin treatment, people fell out of touch and those who are still around have new jobs and commitments. I'm still in contact with Bard of course, as one of my oldest friends, and I still occasionally talk to Cleric, but Paladin essentially cut off contact with everyone and out of concern for my health I never made an attempt to contact Ranger or Rogue again. After a while, I missed DMing, and so I put out a call in some Discord and Facebook groups to recruit players, and I've now been playing with a brand new group for the last 5 months. Sometimes I feel a little sad when I realise I'm playing with strangers instead of my actual friends, but with every session I come to appreciate these strangers more and more and, on the bright side, the distance created by not knowing anyone personally will ensure this group won't have the same issues.

**Update:** After seeing how much of a reaction this story got, I thought I'd post a little update to try and answer some questions, clarify some things and offer some resolution. First off, I totally understand that there were a number of times in this story where I dropped the ball or didn't handle something in the correct way. Inviting Paladin back to the game or even allowing Rogue to continue being in the game after the first red flag are things I definitely would have done differently with hindsight. I won't offer any excuses other than to say at the time I was just happy to have what seemed like a regular group of real friends who all gelled together and I honestly underestimated just how problematic these things actually were. During the pandemic RPGs were essentially the only regular social contact we would have with each other, and trying to keep the group going to maintain that contact was my priority. I also feel it's important once again to point out that I'm ace - and I know being ace isn't an excuse for letting obviously manipulative behaviour slide, but it does mean that I sometimes don't really recognise the same cues as allosexual people, particularly when it comes to flirting. It tends to go over my head and needs to be pointed out to me. Even then, I often don't recognise the full extent of it.

Secondly, I fully understand that Rogue does not in any way represent the poly community. I know poly relationships are built on trust and mutual respect and while I didn't really know anything about the poly community at the time, it became pretty obvious to me later that Rogue was just being an asshole and using being poly as an excuse. 

Finally, I sort of glossed over a lot of what happened at the end due to wanting to not make this post even longer, but I want to clarify that both Cleric and I did immediately check up on Paladin and try our very best to apologise for what had happened and to support him. Understandably, he felt very betrayed and while I don't condone death threats, it's obvious he was in a very bad place at the time. These days I do check in on Paladin occasionally and last I heard from him, he has to found a new girlfriend who cares about him and seems to be happy, though understandably doesn't ever want to touch a ttrpg again. I haven't personally spoken to either Ranger or Rogue, though from what I understand (mostly from Cleric as he still talks to Ranger) they're still together but are going through a bit of a rough patch. Apparently several months into their relationship, Rogue started seeing someone else behind Ranger's back, and when he found out she threatened to leave him unless ""he accepted her for who she is"" and he ended up begrudgingly consenting to the situation.","rpghorrorstories",761,761,0,0.95,1,0,0,137

&amp;#x200B;

The latest consumer price index data this week revealed a searing 9.1% increase year over year in June, prompting Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to say that inflation in the U.S. is ""unacceptably high.""

The causes behind the steep jumps include high energy prices, pandemic stimulus spending and geopolitical crises  but one investor is blaming millennials.

 Smead explained that in the U.S. there are an estimated 92 million millennials, primarily in the 27- to 42-year-old age bracket. ""The last time we saw what we call 'wolverine inflation'  which is inflation that is hard for policymakers to stop  was when 75 million baby boomers had replaced 44 million silent generation people in the 1970s."" 

 ""See, what everyone is not including in the conversation is what really causes inflation, which is too many people with too much money chasing too few goods,"" Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.  

 ""So we have in the United States a whole lot of people, (aged) 27 to 42, who postponed homebuying, car buying, for about seven years later than most generations,"" he said. 

""But in the past two years they've all entered the party together, and this is just the beginning of a 10-to-12-year time period where there's about 50% more people that are wanting these things than there were in the prior group.""

""So the Fed can tighten credit, but it won't reduce the number of people wanting these necessities in comparison to the prior group,"" Smead said.

As the Fed pumped the U.S. market with liquidity (or some say, flooded it) and kept interest rates low over the last two years, its officials contended through 2021 that creeping inflation was ""transitory.""

In late May, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen admitted she had been wrong.

""I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,"" [she told CNN's Wolf Blitzer](https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/politics/treasury-secretary-janet-yellen-inflation-cnntv/index.html?utm_source=twCNN&amp;utm_content=2022-05-31T22%3A30%3A07&amp;utm_term=link&amp;utm_medium=social) in an interview. ""There have been unanticipated and large shocks that have boosted energy and food prices, and supply bottlenecks that have affected our economy badly that I ... at the time, didn't fully understand.""

The Fed has approved three interest rate hikes this year, with the latest in mid-June constituting [the largest single increase in the country since 1994 at 75 basis points.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/fed-hikes-its-benchmark-interest-rate-by-three-quarters-of-a-point-the-biggest-increase-since-1994.html?&amp;doc=107088703) After June's inflation print of 9.1%, analysts predict the central bank could deploy a massive 100 basis point rate rise to combat inflation, which in the U.S. is at its highest in 40 years.

Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, when asked earlier this week by reporters about the likelihood of the hike, replied, ""Everything is in play.""","stocks",756,756,0,0.82,0,0,1,634

I think my husband(29M) might frequent the sub. Honestly, the kids might after this - TLDR at the bottom

It started back in March 2020 - about the time the pandemic started. We'd been married happily for a while, to the partial dismay of some family members who thought we jumped into it fast for having a large age gap. The first year of marriage, including the pregnancy of my second child, we were having sex every day. And like, *sex* sex too. He abruptly started to shrug off the idea of sex whenever I would make advancements. By end of 2020 I had stopped trying to initiate almost entirely. At this point I wasn't too worried because life was busy; I just had my second baby, he was busy with work, the pandemic was going on. I didn't think too much of it.

As time went on, I found myself yearning for the way it used to be between us. Around that time I started frequenting this sub and seeing your stories made me even more worried for my own relationship.

The past few weeks, and honestly months, have been similar to how I see a lot of you describe your sex lives.

Fastforward to a couple weeks ago. We were planning a surprise birthday party for our oldest(12M) and he wanted to take care of booking a clown. I had no interest in doing so(and didn't think the kid would like it but was happy he was getting involved), so I had no qualms with him doing it. I take care of most of the rest, handling streamers, invitations, food, all the rest.

The day of the party, we're getting everything set up, he's helping and gives me a little kiss on the cheek. I notice he seems overbearing about the time the clown is arriving. The grandparents are taking care of the kid at the moment and bringing him over in a couple hours back to our house where we'll surprise him. Everything's set up and ready to go when people start arriving. Clown is nowhere to be seen, and coincidentally, my husband is getting antsy. I ask him what's going on and if he's ok but he kind of evades my questions. Against my better judgement, I let it go without further questions.

The party started, our kid was really enjoying it. I was having fun talking to friends of mine. Eventually the clown does show up, much to my husband's excitement. As well as, it appeared, the birthday boy, as they ran up to the clown and hugged her. This of course confused me - was it someone we knew? My husband gets flustered, the clown gets flustered, our kid seems oblivious. You all probably know where this is going, so I'll skip over it. After the party, I asked my husband about it.

He just came straight out and explained everything. He had been meeting with this woman when I was out of the house for a while. Using the bedroom. He had introduced her to the kids in hopes that he could introduce her to me to spice up our collective(?) bedroom life.

It's been a week since that conversation now and I'm honestly still in shock. I don't understand his goal, his plan, anything. I don't know what to do. He refuses the fact that he was cheating on me. But he was cheating on me with a clown. A clown.

TL:DR my husband was cheating on me with a literal clown

I politely informed him that I work in an area of the hospital that requires a mask. What I wanted to do was yell back that its none of his damn business if I wear a mask or not and that he can fuck right off.

11 years of financial and emotional abuse. In the early years, I got pregnant and had an abortion I deeply regretted (still pro choice, just made the wrong choice for me). I got pregnant again twice soon after and lost both babies. Many years later, I found myself pregnant again a few months into the pandemic. I had my son almost 2 years ago now. 

Hes been unemployed for almost a year now, he walked out of his last job while I begged him not to. He quit the job before that when I was 9 months pregnant.

Scramble, cut corners, listen to him promise hed have money for the next bill but hed rarely ever have it.

He had just asked for gas money the day prior, so he drove away with my gas, too. I was originally giving him time to figure out if he wanted to pay cash or return the car to me, but he was blowing up my phone yesterday and Im worried about his mental state. I have little savings and the money from selling that car will make a huge difference to my son and I. I decided I needed the car back, he wouldnt cooperate and said I needed to give him time, hed return it when his life allows. I offered to pick it up, he told me that would be trespassing and hes armed. I got a police escort to help me retrieve the car last night.

Especially with the influx of beginners who picked up the hobby during the pandemic, I feel like I've seen just a crap ton of new somewhat predatory companies/yarnfluencers trying to steer the hobby into a super consumerist experience and that leaves a weird, bad taste in my mouth as a self proclaimed financial Scrooge. In fact for me personally I picked up knitting at 12 because it was like basically the only hobby I could afford, and no, it isn't only for rich people so here are my tips (if I think of anything else I'll add an edit):

1. You are not a hostage to the yarn featured in the pattern you're interested in making! Learn how to do yarn substitution - frankly it's not that deep. You can be an expert on yarn sub after watching like a 2 minute youtube video. Like, a worsted weight 4 yarn is pretty ubiquitous and if a yarnfluencer pattern is calling for a 4 weight $30/skein yarn, to be honest, any other 4 weight yarn is gonna work (just make sure you can hit gauge but I don't always do a gauge swatch when the pattern calls for a 4 because..... worsted weight yarn is just kinda like idk forgiving in that way?). This can really help you save $$ on yarn AND you can even change the color palette to something you actually enjoy. 

2. Buying/using acryllic yarn does not mean you are destroying the planet. I really feel like those 100% natural fiber yarnfluencers are tbh virtue signaling. You buying 4 skeins of $2 Red Heart to make yourself a cardigan is not going to condemn the planet. The real existential threat to the planet are massive corporations that are not held to any type of account, the media has just manipulated individual people into believing that it's their problem to save the world. Believe me, you using a couple skeins of acryllic yarn will not compensate for the damage these companies are doing, so there's no point hamstringing your budget to avoid cheap acryllic imo AND if you use acryllic you can actually throw your makes into the washer (be honest with yourself - do you really have the time to hand wash everything you make because you only use natural fibers?). Yarnfluencers who push the natural fiber only narrative are preying on your sense of duty and are getting a $ kickback when you buy the yarn they push down your throat.

3. Buy a ball winder and head to the thrift store. Unravel thrifted sweaters if you REALLY need that wool in your life. I do this all the time. I go to like Goodwill and shop in the Men's XXXL or other large sized sections for 100% wool sweaters that I can unravel and wind into new skeins of yarn. You can get like 1500 yards of wool for like $4, AND you can feel happy about your environmental impact or whatever without overpaying an influencer to mediate lol. There are a ton of videos on YouTube teaching you how to unravel sweaters and what to look for in the thrift store. Also, because you have to kinda take what you get when you do this, you learn like so much about sweater construction and it forces you to be creative. This is basically what I would consider helped me get to that advanced level. Once you learn construction and creativity in this way (which can be challenging at first!) you can make anything and you are no longer beholden to needing to buy patterns. Which brings me to my next point.

4. The patterns that 2020/pandemic-made yarnfluencers put out are not good (because they themselves are beginners) or are, again, predatory. The amount of stockinette crop tops or like garter stitch scarves patterns I see for sale are wild. This stuff is free and it should be free, but a lot of beginners don't know where to look. There are great free beginner patterns on YouTube and ravelry. And, if you see something for free that is slightly different that the vision for what you want, I recommend trying to figure out how to modify that free pattern vs. buying something overpriced written by another beginner. This takes time and trial and error, but learning or manipulating construction will set you tf up for the future of your development of the craft. When you start doing more complicated things, you can critically think your way into projects and out of problems as opposed to freaking out because the count is off in the pattern etc. I've found beginners to be really uncomfortable with dropping stitches or making errors, and I hate that this insecurity is more normalized vs. literally just teaching people how to knit their way out of a tangled situation. It's a craft. Its creative. There's many ways to approach an issue, and I see a lot of yarnfluencer produced beginner patterns as extremely rigid. Maybe the new yarnfluencers want to keep you a little ignorant so they can keep selling you ez patterns?? Because once you get a few basic skills under your belt (like literally how to read your knitting lol) you could reverse engineer their entire pattern library in 3 seconds????

5. Unleash your creativity and try to hack your own patterns with the yarn you can find on clearance or unravel from thrifted sweaters! Ignore the yarnfluencers and their cults of personality! I haven't used a pattern in years, and I don't know wtf people are talking about when they post on here all like ""ah yes here is my Lupin or Ranunculu-whatever or insert some flowery aesthetic name for literally a garment hahah. I make what I want, and you can and should too - this is the cheapest way to do this hobby. If you're a true beginner, I always just recommend going to a big box craft store and buying a pair of size 8 needles and a skeins of yarn you think is pretty. Thats it and its like 5-10 bucks with a coupon. Knit a scrunchie for your first project, or a seemed beanie, or a scarf, or a dishcloth! Or just make a square to practice new things and use it as a coaster or stuffing layer idk. Its knitting its not that deep and people have been doing it to stay warm for like ever. Don't feel pressured to buy specific yarns, knit specific patterns, or follow specific trends because this is a fundamentally utilitarian hobby that got scrambled by capitalism when the pandemic brought a lot of newbies into the fold. 


6. Finally, don't join knitting groups hosted by local yarn shops. They tend to be full of yarn snobs and they make you pay a cover if you don't buy that $40 ball of purest baby lamb merino from their store lol. Check your local library or rec center for groups because you can join these with no strings attached and people use a variety of yarns in these settings. I also find that joining groups like this helps you learn how to actually do stuff much faster than staying online because they are full of (ahem im sorry but its true) older ladies with 30 years experience who stay out of the yarnfluencer bullshit and know their craft like you wouldn't believe. And they will teach you like so hard if you ask them for help. Most of the people in the group I go to haven't used a pattern since like the 1980's. You could even start your own if your local library doesn't already have a group. If you make it they will (probably) come. And ik, im only 25 and sometimes I feel like I want to be with other young knitters but I wouldn't trade my group for the world - I can talk to them about life experiences (some of them burnt their bras in feminist marches back in the day haha) and grow my professional network at the same time.

AND THATS ALL I CAN THINK OF K THANKS

TL; DR yarn substitution, I bless you to use acryllic yarns, learn how to unravel thrifted sweaters, try your hand at making stuff sans patterns, avoid filling your social media feeds with yarnfluencers, join knitting groups hosted by public resources like libraries and rec centers, chill - it's not that deep &amp; enjoy your hobby.

The book that I consider the best for learning and becoming an autonomous critical knitter is Vogue Knitting. Its awesome. I feel like the odd one out that I didn't learn raglan from Flax, but rather through following the prompts from vogue knitting after taking one measurement (the width of the back of my neck lol) and that was.... literally it.","knitting",707,707,0,0.93,5,0,0,319

(She was perfectly accurate against the Census and Google maps - amazing considering she was 80 years old when she recorded it!) She spoke in that old San Francisco accent (ie ""Golden Gate Pawk"") and lived on Alabama Street between 25th and 26th from 1909 to at least the mid 1920s.

Some of my take aways:

* During the Spanish flu pandemic, schools were closed and she remembers watching the hearses going up and down the street collecting all the dead bodies. She knew it was really sad (her baby sister was one of them), but she also said the horses' manes were ornately braided and decorated and she thought the horses were really beautiful
* She liked taking the street car up to Union Square and Market St to go shopping, but (and I quote) ""I NEVER went to Fisherman's Wharf!!!"" (some things never change!)
* ""Everything was 5 cents!""
* They were Irish but her family LOVED tamales and there was a nearby shop where she could get 10 for a dollar.
* The streets had lots of  horse manure on them, so the city sent out ""water wagons"" to clean it up periodically.
* She played on the slides and merry go round in the children's playground in Golden Gate Park
* In what is now the SF Zoo, there was a public pool with a beautiful high diving board ([https://sfrichmondreview.com/2019/03/10/9588/](https://sfrichmondreview.com/2019/03/10/9588/))

A few posts on this topic lately and a common opinion seems to be you dont stop being a mum just because you have grandchildren. As a general notion, I can agree. However, Ive also seen a loooot of posts in support of the new cool grandparents who dont have time to see their grandchildren as theyre busy travelling the world or growing their own hobbies. Many of who had a lot of help from their parents growing up. 

And thats where something starts to not add up. I am NOT saying that it should be expected of grandparents to babysit all the time; theyre not the parents. However, if you dont stop being a parent just because you have grandchildren is true when it comes to celabrating a holiday, then I think its certainly true in terms of what can be expected of a parent to an adult. Personally I think you never stop being a parent and I would NEVER leave my child to fend for their own entirely just because they turn 18. Even if they stand on their own feet I will always be there for support and aid when necessary. Although not legally necessary I think this can be expected of a (good) parent to adult children. 

When I struggled as a new parent a year ago when LO was newly born my mum and dad were nowhere to be seen. Because of the pandemic I accepted this but had hoped to get some guidance and advise over the phone from an experienced mother. I cried and bled from my nipples every feed and tried to get help from the hospital but didnt get any. When I finally cracked at called my mum for support while struggling with the tears to talk she as quickly as possible found an excuse to end the call. In the coming weeks she sent pics of what she was up to without asking about how my the baby and I were. As soon as the restrictions lifted a bit my parents started to travel the entire country. In the months after my daughter was born Ive never seen them travel so much. No travel ever ended with the destination of their granddaughter. Ive been absolutely crushed about how little my mum seems to care about her new grandchild. 

Honesty I dont care so much about Mothers Day and its surprising that I would make a post about it really. But I guess its more about the principle. 

TLDR; Yes the notion of You dont stop being a mum just because you get grandchildren is true but a grandmother cant cherry pick when its true. If you choose to not be there for any of the rainy days as a grandmother dont expect to be welcomed with open arms when the sunny days appear.

# I was raped by a coworker, and it has now cost my family everything we had.

Six months ago, I left this comment on askreddit with the promise that I would update the story eventually.

*I made a throwaway for this question.*

*We were at a work party, I was in college and she was a career waitress.*

*I  had recently gotten out of a long term relationship that just fucking  destroyed me, I wanted nothing, no sex, no hook ups, no cuddling in bed,  I just wanted to be alone. I picked up the job at the restaurant to  keep myself busy and make some extra money. I needed my time occupied,  and this was the best way at the time.*

*She  had came on to me at work, but I kindly turned her down, telling her  that i was not ready for any kind of relationship. She flirted often,  but I didnt reciprocate. I literally had zero interest, in anyone.*

*I  had 2 drinks at the party, and then one at a coworkers house after work  shut their party down. I blacked out (not at all like me), woke up  around sunrise half naked with her snuggled up to me. We had definitely  had sex, no fucking condom in sight. I was confused, very very confused.  Not happy. Not even a little bit.*

*I  slithered our from under her and got dressed, I walked a few miles home  and passed out for over 12 hours, missed my shift at work that day.*

*I  went in the next day and told them what had happened, i got a write up  for missing my shift and made fun of for complaining about getting laid.  I walked out and never went back.*

*15  years later, I found out she had had a baby. We are in the process of  finding out if its mine. This shit consumes my thoughts every goddamn  day now. I have no idea what we are going to do if he is mine.*

*Edit:  this is all fresh, she wants back money. Very very much about the  money, I dont know why but she thinks that were loaded or something.  We are not by any means. Life has been one expensive disaster after  another for my entire adulthood. This is my wifes insulin she dropped  today while shaking about what the fuck we are going to do. Everything  is a mess.*

*Ill update this story minus identifying details on this profile if you want to follow. Maybe it will be cathartic for me.*

As  it turns out, the child was mine. We were hit with a massive child  support amount to provide and were thinking that things were going to be  ok in a few years after we caught it up. Right up until the pandemic  hit and we both lost our jobs. Everything slipped, all the bills piled  up. It was ok though, we still had food on the table and were hopeful to  return to work.

We still havent  returned since March. We were nearly out of money when today I went to  get a few groceries and my card was declined. I was embarrassed, but  thought that surely there was a mistake. Nope, the state seized the tiny  bit of money we had left.  No way to buy food, no way to buy my wifes  insulin or supplies. Just a big pile of hopelessness.

Im sitting in my car and I have no idea how to go inside to tell my wife just how screwed we are.

You can do everything youre supposed to, and still wind up at the bottom.

I wish my family didnt suffer from my unfortunate past.

Edit:  a redditor is shipping us a months supply of insulin. I cannot begin to  tell you how grateful we are to this community and the people that make  it up.

The outpouring of support  is overwhelming. We put our kids to bed and are sitting here reading all  these kind words. Its a lot. Thank you all.

# Update for those following my story. I was raped by a coworker and now my family has lost everything.

We  are overwhelmed by the support from reddit. We have food and my wife is  set for insulin. I cannot explain how relieving this is. We have a bit  of footing to start to get our lives back.

I  have contacted the state and requested a reduction in our support  payments. We have applied for social services in our state, hopefully we  will qualify for some assistance.

Ive  been doing my best replying to the DMs Ive gotten. There are so many  stories of boys and men being abused by people they were supposed to  trust. Its beyond heartbreaking. All these years, Ive thought that I  was an outlier, that these things didnt really happen - at least not  all that often.

I was wrong. There  have been so many of you that reached out to me telling your story. Im  so sorry. So sorry that it happened, so sorry you werent taken  seriously.

You still have value. You are still you. I believe you.

Im taking the time to reply to all of you. We can heal together. Step by step. You are not alone.

# I got laughed at when I told a social worker that a woman had raped me.

She  didnt even entertain the notion. The things yall say to try to get  out of paying. I didnt even know what to say. I was already  exasperated. I didnt even find out that a child had come from her  climbing on top of me when I was passed out drunk until 13 years later.  They slapped my family with every fee imaginable. Four years of back  support due immediately. They seized our bank account. I didnt find out  they had suspended my license until I applied to doordash.

Yesterday,  I finally got an actual person on the phone and was informed that I had  to voluntarily pay $450 before they would allow my license to be  reinstated. The money they seized meant nothing apparently. Our entire  bank account, and the round of stimulus checks that went out earlier  this year, all taken but it means nothing as it wasnt voluntarily  given.

I broke down and told the  case worker how this child had come to be. How the way things were being  handled were destroying the lives of our family, and all but  guaranteeing that they would receive no further funds. She fucking  laughed at the notion that a woman could possible rape a man. How  ridiculous an idea. I felt gross and violated all over again.

I hate how something from my past is causing my family to suffer. It isnt fair to them.

Im so frustrated and I had to get it out.

The title pretty much says it all, but some backstory might be appropriate. 
I live with my boyfriend, we've been together for 3.5 years and are expecting our first child, I am currently 31 weeks. I have a daughter from a previous relationship. This will be my MILs first grandchild. 
I understand that this is a big event for her and I do my best to tell her how everything goes when I talk to her. 
We have been in a pandemic half our relationship so I haven't met her more than maybe five or six times. She lives a two hour drive away and my boyfriend has been working a lot this past 5 months so we haven't had much time to travel around to visit. 
She called me yesterday and asked for a picture of my belly. I'm not too comfortable with my body because of my past and hate taking pictures, but tried to suggest that I would take a look in my closet if I had any clothes that would fit and look ok in a picture. Her answer was that she just wanted a picture of my belly. That sounded like a weird request to me. So my next suggestion was that we could come visit so she could see how I look now. But she still wanted the picture so she had something to look at. When she said it, it just felt so creepy and made me really uncomfortable. 

I love being pregnant and I love that it shows, but I'm not comfortable with people touching me,  I do accept it and don't say anything when they do, and not at all comfortable with the thought of giving away pictures of my belly. 
My boyfriend doesn't think it's a big deal since I am pregnant, but for me it doesn't matter if I'm pregnant or not, it's still my body. 

So the question is, AITA for refusing to send my MIL a picture of my belly?

Thanks to everyone that read, it felt good just to write down how I feel even though I might be overreacting.

Edit
I've tried to explain to my bf and compare it to how he would feel if my mom would ask for a picture of his belly, he thinks it is different because he is not pregnant, apparently he doesn't understand that it's not different for me if I'm pregnant or not. 

MIL made it pretty clear that she just wanted a picture of the belly, NOT a picture of me. thats the creepy part.. 

She will of course get ultrasound pics.

Thanks to everyone that responded. It made me feel so much better knowing that Im not completely unreasonable in this situation

She got an art degree. She experimented with stripping in college as a feminist act. She used to love people regardless of color. 

But it only took 6 years to change her. Shitty social media, people who know how to prey on her anxiety, take advantage of her neurodiversity, and weedle results out of her low self-esteem, that's all it took. It took 10 steps.

Step 1: Sell fear and distrust as a remedy for health anxieties. Her partner encourages her to get into homeopathic remedies, including crystal healing, oil pulling, smoking tons of weed, and other internet cures.

Step 2. Use that subtle distrust against government and civil devices. She begins to latch on to conspiracies that are mostly health related - chem trails are poisonous, radio waves are cancerous, salt crystal lamps clean your wifi of negative ions, manifestation, etc.

Step 3. Weaponize fear. Around the pandemic, she is nearly assaulted by a man on the train. This amplifies her anxiety. She is afraid all the time. She buys the biggest pepper spray keychain I have ever seen. She starts to talk about learning how to shoot. She wants someone to buy her a bow and arrow for xmas. When dad says he won't, she says ""Don't worry, I will find some other way to get one"".

Step 4. Separate her from her community and family by leveraging her growing distrust. The pandemic hits, and she is anti-mask. She starts up a convo about Fauci on her birthday that I mistook as  a genuine question about why it took so long to make the mask recommendation happen when he first was against it. I start to answer in a conversational way and she runs across a road to avoid talking to me. She begins to arrange mid-pandemic birthday parties which she never used to care about and guilt me for skipping holidays by saying our dad might die before the next one happens. I refuse to attend, and consider never going to family birthdays she is organizing again.

Step 5. Preach the gospel at any cost. Family members start informing me of alt-right talking points she has been sharing. She believes Donald Trump is a genius who, along with Ghislane, is busting a child sex ring run by democrats. She starts sending me videos of god knows what, which I pretend I watched, and I try to ask her questions to lead her out of her delusions. That was a terrible idea. I learn that she believes that the world is degrading and only those who know the ""truth"" are able to understand that we are at the lowest point in human history, a shift will happen, and some day we will be delivered. Or something. I express shock and pity. She rightfully got pissed at me. She starts making her own videos and posting them to instagram. She spends a lot of time on her phone, or in her room now.

Step 6. Convince her she doesn't need help. Dad tells me they have had convos about her going to therapy and she expresses interest, but ultimately does not do it.

Step 7. Create a ""them vs. you"" mentality, because if they don't agree they are harming you. She's anti-vax. She starts to date right-wing Q anon men she finds online. She tells everybody in the family that she won't talk to them if they get vaxxed. She stops talking to our mom for about a week after mom gets one. She gets in a text argument with me where she calls me a ""useful idiot"". 

Step 8. Lower their ambition to leave the community by convincing them they are undesirable without it. She has a brief crisis where she believes she is infertile because she slept with a vaxxed guy, but she stays with him because he owns a gun store. After breaking up, she begins to surround herself with virtual friends and dates only if they share ""her beliefs"". She says that she is desperate to find a man and have a baby because that is her value as a woman.

Step 9. Turn her self-doubt and insecurities into hate for non-supporters. Her opinions have gone all the way down the Q hole. She now does not want to have kids, but feels guilty because her ""genes are so good she is morally obligated to pass them on"". I didn't think this was racist until mom mentioned she ""now hates black people, and especially gay people"" even though she dated two black men within the last year. Now I suspect it's something to do with her promoting the white race or some shit. 

Step 10. Profit?

We were never close. We had a really difficult childhood that pitted us against each other, completely different interests, and clashing pride. I never expected to be her best friend, but now I'm wondering if I can even call myself her sister. I am waiting for the day she decides my interracial marriage is ""a sin"". I am waiting for the day she hurts my dad, or a stranger, or herself. She does not trust me, or anyone else in the family. We do not trust her. My oldest sister has already decided not to talk to her after she came out as a Trump supporter last election. I am unable to reel her back, and have considered cancelling social engagements she is invited to. My parents are enabling and protecting her, because they believe she will go no-contact with them, or something worse might happen to her.

When I adopted her from a kill shelter, she was a tiny thingbarely even able to walk, much less meow. The only sound she did emit was a small squeak. 

Its common superstition that cats like heraka black catsare bad luck, which is just plain bogus. Shes been an absolute treasure. Shes kept me sane during this pandemic, and she keeps me company too.

She would always hide in places that were small, too. Cupboards, underneath tables and chairs, under my bed. Eventually, she started coming out more and more. Nowadays, Id say shes pretty comfortable around me. She still squeaks. Meows, too. Her favorite food is wet food. Shes also very playful.

Ever since an attempted break in a couple of months back, shes always been at my sideliterally. She wont leave even for a second, and hisses whenever she hears anyone outside. These past couple of months, though, shes been acting a bit off. For example, she has a cat bed at the corner of my room, since she isnt allowed on the bed. A couple of nights a week, I feel her fur rubbing against my hand, and end up petting her and muttering something in a half-asleep state. When I awake fully, shes always asleep in her cat bed. 

Similarly, when Im half-asleep, I could swear that I hear her moving under my bed despite her bed being in the corner and me swearing that she had fallen asleep there.

Despite her weird antics as of late, I still love her, and she loves me. One of our favorite games to play is called Pass The Hair Tie. I play with her whenever Im bored or whenever she initiates. 

I was in the bathroom with the door closed when the hair tie flew towards my feet from under the door.

Hi, baby, I murmur, pulling the hair tie back and flinging it under the door to the opposite side.

I wait for a few seconds, and, as predicted, the hair tie comes flying back to me. I stand up, washing my hands, and hear the doorknob wiggle. Didnt know you knew how to open doors with your paws, I joke. After washing my hands, I wipe them on the towel and sling the hair tie under the door again. Its locked anyway. That was true; the door locked automatically and could only unlock if I turned the doorknob from the inside. 

The doorknob noises stopped, presumably because she was too busy getting the hair tie. The space under the door wasnt big enough for a paw to fit, but it was enough for the hair tie to be slung under, which it was in a matter of seconds. This time, though, it seemed& faster. Angrier, somehow. Mostly because the hair tie flew underneath the door so fast that it hit the bathtubs exterior and bounced off it a bit.

I heard a soft mrrp from the shower and froze, heart thumping painfully in my chest. Slowly, I opened the shower curtain, and there sat Shadow, staring at me with wide eyes. Her gaze then travelled to the bathroom door. The doorknob jiggled, and she let out a low hiss.

Ive since called the police. It was apparently the same person that had tried to break inhed been inside my house several times, according to them. They also found evidence that he was living in the house as wellspecifically in my room and under my bed, which makes me think the noises under it and the fur& well, they werent Shadow.

Ive since moved into a new place, and both she and I are happier and a lot less tense. I do know one thing, thoughif she starts hissing at any doors or windows, call the police or move again immediately. She hasnt been hissing at anything yet, though, so Im taking that as a good sign. She still has her cat bed at the corner of the room, but she no longer sleeps there. Instead, she sleeps cuddled next to me as she should.","nosleep",656,656,0,0.97,0,0,0,25

Anyway  we flew our kite in our neighborhood park with some other families. It was a great day regardless. I love Austin, but just sometimes forget that things are the way they are now and when I am faced with it, it invokes an emotional response. I know a lot of people feel that way too.

Am I over the top in the boundaries I have set?","Edit to add, please don't share, crosspost, publish, all that stuff. 

Long post, I'm sorry. This has been 7 years coming.

So DH and I have been married for 10 years, together for 11 and we have amazing 7 year old twins. He is amazing, so worth the wait, dreamy hubby.  MIL has always been quirky and her own person, but once we had the kids, things got worse. Before then, shed monopolize all conversations with the same monologues every time, expect her husband and grown kids to literally wait on her hand and foot (Come here, X and grab that remote {that is literally next to her} for me. And they would. Ridiculous but manageable.

Since we had the kids and started visiting the ILs with them though, things have gotten out of control. They live an 8-10 hour drive away each way so our first visit was when the kids were about 9 mos old, just for info.

A short list of things that have happened in the past 7 years, EVERY time except 2 that we have visited:

* Walked in from 10 hour drive, DD crawls in and immediately grabs a pill from the floor and puts it in her mouth. We understandably lose our minds, bc MIL has no idea what the pill is and WHO LEAVES PILLS ON THE FLOOR WHEN BABIES ARE COMING?
   * Pity party ensues, and blaming us ensues, and how dare we tell her that pills on the floor are dangerous for babies. 30 min monologue about how hard her life has been. I add, Well, you almost just killed your granddaughter, so that could have been added to your list. More pity party
* Walked into find uncapped insulin needles on the floor, table, etc. More pills.
* Create safety plan with ILs, write it down, DH reminds them prior to next visit several times.
* Walk in and you guessed it, more needles. At this point, I say F-it, were going, huge pity party, I lose my shit, DH says were NOT leaving bc look, dads cleaning it up. Enabler much?
* Another visit, FIL gives MIL her insulin shot, leaves it uncapped ON FLOOR where kids are toddling/walking/playing. He walks by it a few times ignoring it till I walked over, picked it up, and asked if anyone was going to properly dispose of this? Pity party
* Meds in non-childproof pill  containers on every surface of house when we walk in. I ask DH is he going to say something or am I? He calmly goes and tells FIL weve asked them every visit to put the meds in the bedroom when were here. FIL gets mad and inulted, but cleans them up.
* They visit us, for baby naming, which is at our house. I say no smoking near house, change clothes, etc, no holding babies if smell like smoke bc they babies also have asthma, never mind mine, which is triggered violently by smoke. Guess what? Came home from work house reeking of smoke, having 30 people over the next day, I cant breathe in my own house, despite many air purifiers on. Then getting ready to put kids to bed, FIL who still reeks of smoke, hugs and kisses DS who then REEKS of smoke. Hes 9 months old. I said very loudly, well I guess hes getting another bath today. FIL asks why? I say, because now he smells like smoke and he cant sleep like that. Told DH he needs to lay down the law or I will. Whats it going to be?
* Other visits to our house, they leave insulin needles around where kids can open them, FIL leaves beer cans in bedside table drawer? More smoking, more asthma
* MIL has untreated out of control diabetes and also veinous insufficiency which she refused to do anything about. She has been fired from several doctors due to noncompliance but its all their fault of course. They have fly infestations in their house year round, and so far has had maggots in her legs 4ish times? Each time has fought us on going to the hospital, but each time she gave in they admitted her and one time they had to do pic line antibiotics bc she is immune to most due to noncompliance. The last time she had them was during the height of the pandemic and she didnt want to go to the hospital, understandably, but thats an emergency so DH got into a fight with her about going. Told her if she doesnt go on her own, hes driving there to take her. She wouldnt go so he drove THROUGH THE NIGHT in the middle of the pandemic before vaccines to take her ass to the hospital. I told him he needs to pull up, drag her ass out of the house and to the hospital and come home. No excuses, enough is enough. And not to let her talk him into not going bc this is all a manipulation to get attention from him. He gets there, goes to sleep (understandably), and what do you know, she doesnt want to go, but she will agree to go to a doc in the box. So they go, and they give her& amoxicillin. Not even augmentin. The bubble gum medicine. For infections that are resistant to antibiotics and have caused maggots to be drawn to them. He gave her exactly what she wanted.
* Other times these same sores have leaked out so much fluid that she has to wrap her feet in plastic grocery bags and drag them around like that. The bags are full of infected fluid. Where the kids play. She argues that its not dangerous for the kids, and DH listens to her. Um, Im sorry, they are clearly infected and leaking infected fluid onto the nasty carpet is NOT in any way shape or form safe for kids to play on.
* Roof  leaked so badly and for so long that black mold moved in. They had a buddy cut it out (ie spread it all over the room and in the walls) and paint over it. Black mold is bad news, but again, not allowed to say anything.
* BIL is (now in recovery) an alcoholic. LIves with ILs bc has never had to have any accountability or job or way to support himself bc mommy and daddy will take care of it. Hes 50some years old, has 2 kids and has been enabled to the point of purposeless and learned helplessness/weoponized incompetence.
   * He has done the following while we were visiting:
      * Picked DD up by her feet and threw her head first into foam pit despite me screaming, Not head first, not head first, not head first!!!!!!! as soon as he picked her up. Her neck/shoulders/back were sore the next few days. I was not allowed to be angry bc you know, he just doesnt know any better. Hes 50some years old.
      * When he was supposed to be sober (and I know the process of getting sober is a bitch so not judging the relapses or anything here), kids took out toy boxes that were where they played and almost empty hard alcohol bottles were in there. They were like, Oh cool, fancy drinks! and tried to open them up and drink them. Not allowed to be angry
      * Chain smoker- again, asthma and cant breathe.
      * During height of covid, refused to wear mask inside, routinely picked the kids up and breathed in their faces, etc. Hes anti-vax which is his business bc we know its not our place to ask that they get vaccinated, but at the very least, when cases are climbing 1000% each day, wear a f-ing mask in the house with visitors if they ask

This is the short version, just the highlights. So I get anxious every time we go because Im gaslighted and scapegoated every time because Im too concerned about health stuff (says the lady with maggots in her legs, so the bar for concern is pretty low), and demand too much of them because theyre just incompetent (DHs version). DH knows theyre incompetent, knows hes the only one in that family who has any sense, knows its not normal, but is tired, understandably, of asking them to do things that they see as unreasonable, every time we visit.

To be clear,this is my list of demands according to my husband:

* no maggots, no pills and needles lying around
* air purifiers to be on (which they have and we bring more if needed),
* masks during the height of the pandemic (confirmed by pediatrician who I talked to but he refused to talk to and confirm thats their recommendation), I bring masks every time weve come during the pandemic, so they dont have to buy any; I bring child sizes, adult sizes, etc  but it doesnt matter
* Please test before we come. The last time we visited, I sent them tons of tests ahead of time, before you could get them for free, and still they couldnt do it.
* being outside as much as possible (bc MIL refuses to leave the couch so demands an audience in front of her, again, understandably that she wants to see the kids playing together bc theyre super cute together)
* If they smoke, to please wash their face and use air freshener or something so I can breathe. Im super sensitive to smoke and its one of my worst triggers. Not telling anyone  not to smoke but being in a house with chain smokers does so much damage to my lungs that its literally months of high doses of prednisone to get it under control. \`

And every time we visit, they either dont do it, halfway do it and get mad when we remind them of what would be safe, or ask them to put their mask on, or ask them to not get up in our kids faces, or ask them to retake a test that is unclear before we schlep all the way there. They are so nasty to my husband that he gets mad at me for putting him in that position. I get it. I cant imagine what that would feel like. But my boundaries are to keep everyone, including them, safe. Were in a pandemic. You can either test before we come stay in your house, or not. Your choice, and if you choose not to, we choose not to come. No skin off our backs. You have maggots in your legs, go to the hospital, and if you choose not to, we choose not to come. No biggie. Boundaries are good things.

This time, we asked them to test EVERYONE before we got in the car. He asked MIL, she said they would, she said they did they day we left. I asked for pics just to make sure, he said I was being ridiculous and they know how to read a test. Ok. Good luck with that. So we drive there, getting in at midnight and head over there the next day. I look on the table, there are 3 tests on there (there are 6 people in the house), and one test either looks positive or its bled a lot in the time between the test and when we saw it. DH asks MIL why there are only 3 tests, she says, bc only 3 of them needed to take it. DH says, Nope, what part of everyone includes half of you? MIL: Well the kids had to take them to go to school. DH: When was that?? MIL: Last week or something? DH explains that theyd had a whole conversation about it and went over why everyone meant everyone, and that he cant ask them to do a single freaking thing. I was proud of him! Cue pity party and temper tantrum. MIL says its all my fault, that Im too concerned with this health stuff, and I just hate going there. BTW, 4.5 year old neice is in the room listening to all of this. I say, No, I dont hate coming, DH yells, Yeah, you do! MIL starts talking about how expectations are different with them than in our everyday perfect life and what do we do when we go to movies and school (we wear masks, still.Bc covid is still spreading like crazy). MIL is clearly the victim, Im just bullying them and I just hate going there. I ask her to please stop putting words in my mouth and let me talk. More screaming. So I walk away and say, OK were done here. Almost immediately, phone rings and other nieces school calls and she is sick so SIL has to go pick her up. So yeah, were out. MIL going on and on about how I hate going, I cant get a word in to defend myself or explain myself, or anything. DH backs MIL and says all I do is make it impossible for him to see his family. Its all my fault. I point out that the things and boundaries I put into place are NOT unreasonable, and are following CDC guidelines, and are based on the previous 7 year history of every visit being a shit show, and my job is to protect our kids, not MILs feelings. It doesnt matter. Weve listened to Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Kids on the way there last time and it was eye opening to him but this time we listened to a little bit of Recovering& but he tuned out the whole time. He has given me the silent treatment for the last 24 hours. He doesnt understand that setting boundaries is part of growing up and taking care of your family and is healthy. He sees that he is taking out his frustrations with his familys incompetence on me because Im the one making him have these conversations with them. Hes always just done what they wanted to not rock the boat; I dont live like that nor will I and nor will I show our kids that thats acceptable.

So Im wondering, how do I help my husband navigate his family so we are all safe when we visit? Are my requests/boundaries out of line? I dont think so, but tell me if they are. Im a believer in running things by others to check my level of anxiety, DH doesnt talk to anyone about this stuff bc it shouldnt be anyones business. So he lives in a vacuum chamber of his family. Weve had a few sessions with my own therapist but he was really uncomfortable and shut off so Ive offered to find a therapist to help us navigate this together because the last thing im going to do is let her ruin our marriage (well, how he deals with her and me ruin our marriage). I need some objective ideas and input.

PS. The kicker is Ive been a school counselor for 20+ years and in my residency for licensed counselor. I have extensive training and experience  in treating personality disorders and trauma, EMDR, Parts work, attachment work and theory, etc. But apparently MIL knows more than I do. Maybe she does?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: Thank you all for your thoughtful comments, even the ones towards me. I can handle it, and appreciate the bluntness. Need to clear a few things up:

1. Their house isn't like a drug den like I made it out to be. The pill and needle events were single pill, and random numbers of needles depening on the situation. None of it is ok, but want to be as accurate as I can.
2. Thank you to the commenter who pointed out that I shouldn't be diagnosing. Although I can diagnose, I shouldn't have, so I deleted those parts. Thank you for pointing that out.
3. The situation for the last couple of years has been \*better\* in terms of maggots, pills, needles. SIL took over MIL's care from FIL who became too sick to ""take care"" of her, and she has done a good job making sure those things aren't happening. Mold and smoke and no masks/testing issues are still there, but I guess in their minds, things are 100% better?
4. Also DH's other problem with me making a big deal every time we go visit is that ""I don't have these rules anywhere else, just with his family. I don't make other people test and send the kids to school, etc"" I don't need these rules with everyone else because they're common fucking sense and basic decency. But on the very rare occasion we spend time with my parents inside, we all test beforehand. And wear masks. My brother was throwing a hissy fit over wearing masks around my parents and DH was like, ""WTF, just wear the mask."" He can see it in others but not in his family.

More edits:

* I guess mods closed the comments so I can't reply to all of you but wanted to acknowledge:
   * some of you commented that I seem to be posting, yep to many comments but not realizing they were made towards me. Those ""yep's"" were just acknowledging that you are 100% right, and they're things I've vehemently shared with DH. Points I've made, and yes, I do have responsibility in not making this an even bigger deal and putting my foot down. Those that have said shame on me, yes, 100% shame on me. I have no problem admitting my role in also trying to keep the peace and run interference so that the kids can spend time with his family. It stops now. But I appreciate y'all calling me out, really, because  it just emphasizes how much of myself and my kids I've sacrificed to make his mommy happy when all she cares about is getting her way, no matter who it harms. So thank you.
   * Calling around to therapists on Monday for us to see together and for him to see individually. It's not a choice any more. ","JUSTNOMIL",651,651,0,0.94,1,1,0,257

I'll know =@

This was from a while ago but i remembered this story this evening and thought it was funny. 

Im going to refer to my fiance as DH because its easier that way. Anyways, a while ago DH and I went to JNMILs house. It's important to note that I wasn't (and probably am still not) welcome in her house, but she was being the bigger person and allowed me to set foot within her premises whilst I helped DH lift a new desk into her house for her. She's ever so kind. 

Anyways she insisted DH pick up some of his things he mistakenly left there when he moved out three years ago. These were childhood items that JNMIL had been sorting through, all of which DH has since thrown away (what a shame!), but it was important to her that he collect the items from her house. I'm talking old shoes, a broken tennis racket, clothes that are 2 sizes too small, a few meaningless school awards, and some other random things. 

Whilst there, JNMIL proudly showed us her ""future grand baby toys!!"", which was a pile of items she has found during her clean up that she thinks any child would love. These items include: a colouring book that is missing several pages and has most of the pictures already coloured in, a broken toy phone, several stuffed animals that are discoloured and filthy, and 20 year old play dough. I opened the play dough and it could crack a skull if you threw it. Neat weapon for a toddler.

Now DH is her youngest. These are toys from his older siblings that she has kept. FOR DECADES. Which she now plans to graciously hand down to our future children, who will likely catch some mysterious new rare disease from, sending the world plummeting into another pandemic. Don't worry, I will single handedly stop the outbreak by taking it to the tip. Or a ceremonial burn. Or perhaps ill submerge them in cement and drop them in the ocean. No COVID 2.0 on my watch. 

Bonus thing- My favourite line of the day was when DH said ""well I'm just going to throw all this out"" to which JNMIL angrily replied ""well why have I been keeping it all these years?!?!"" To which DH responded ""good question, I have no idea."" I just adore how she blames her hoarding on others.","JUSTNOMIL",643,643,0,0.99,0,0,0,35

Please help share or sign the petition","There is a petition in favor of saving North SeaTac Park for a second, and hopefully final time. 

I just heard from a business owner near North SeaTac Park that the Port of Seattle is wanting to turn it into a paid private parking lot for SeaTac Airport. They apparently tried this last year as well but due to petition in favor of the park and ecological reports (the park is home to one of the areas last remaining bogs...) the land grab was not allowed. But here they are trying again. Also worth mentioning that originally homes were on that land and in moving out the agreement was that there would always be a park there. During the peak of the pandemic this park was one of the only places close to our house that we could go enjoy. I walked the long trails while pregnant and later with a stroller and baby. Now my toddler uses the play areas and fields. This park is located in an area that is without a lot of green spaces and it is desperately needed. I'm sad to see this getting swept under the rug. This is 31 acres of green space about to be wiped from the earth for parking lots.

https://www.kctreeequity.org/

Edit to clarify!! Some more info about what exactly is being changed (in case you did not fully read the campaigns goals on the petition on website and agree fully with them)

31 out of 200 acres inside the park are at risk of being developed - not the entire park. This is in the area with the mountain biking trails and near streams, wetlands, and a prehistoric peat bog. It's not mainly a parking lot that's planned. If the Port's plans go forward, there will propbably be one or more parking lots there - but for the employees of the Food Innovation Center (airport food kitchen) that the Port wants to build there. This park is public land because it's owned by a government, the Port of Seattle. The Port wants to develop it commercially.- but supposedly in service of the greater good of its citizens - not for any profit.The question is whether the greater good is served by putting commercial structures in any public park - let alone one that was created in order to compensate residents for airport impacts.","Seattle",633,633,0,0.98,4,1,4,79

(Im currently writing this as my daughter is coughing in her sleep next to me).

We went to the supermarket because I needed to get snacks for Sophia because shes currently only eating the rice snacks due to having gastro the week before and now having a cold. I had three boxes of baby snacks. Sophia was in the carrier on me. An elderly man who looked about in his early 60s had a bunch of gift card in his hand. He asked if he could go in front of me. I declined because I too, only had three items and wanted to go home as quickly as possible as I felt/feel like complete crap. The elderly man decided to then touch my baby and play with her. My baby absolutely hates strangers and was not happy. I told him to not to touch my child. He did not listen and continued to try to touch her hand and Sophia was viably getting upset. He said I was being sassy. I raised my voice and said, we are in a pandemic, no one wants you to touch their child. He then backed off but not before cursing at me and calling me a fucken bitch.

I may be the AH because I could have handled it better. I could have just let him go in front of me and not have to deal with him at all. But at the same time, Im so sick of strangers coming up to me and feeling entitled and constantly grabbing at my baby!

My partner and I were sucked into the Qult for a very short time. He was into it longer than me I think, but not to the extent that I've seen in a lot of stories here. I saw a post on another sub which led me here, and I felt like I wanted to share something I don't often tell most people.

He and I have both been through a tremendous amount of trauma, together and before knowing each other. We have both been through drug addiction, eating disorders/body dysmorphia, repeated childhood abuse (mine mostly emotional and his emotional and physical), other abuse throughout puberty and young adulthood (we grew up in the deep south.. nuff said) some past sexual abuse, etc etc etc. We have been through a lot together- active addiction, getting clean, withdrawal-induced religious delusions, drug-induced delusions during a relapse, homelessness, moving across the country, finding a place living with people who ended up being passive aggressive gaslighters, pregnancy then miscarriage then deciding to remain child-free... man so much shit I could write a fuckin novel lol.

I've been diagnosed with a solid list of mental illnesses including bipolar 2, and I see a therapist (via video chat) biweekly along with taking psych meds which I've now been on for several years. I've completed DBT group therapy (before covid so it was in-person) and have done some EMDR work with a different therapist I had previously (also pre-covid). We both suspect he is also bipolar 2 and possibly ADHD, though he has been putting off seeing a professional for years. He knows it would help, but of course I'm not going to push him to do it if he's not ready. Regardless, he has made tremendous progress over the years.

We've grown a lot as individuals and as a couple through all of that, but it doesn't change the fact that we both have mental illness that was long exacerbated by drug use, and we experienced trauma together along with shared delusions. That leaves us predisposed to suffering from other shared delusions, and given that both of us grew up Catholic it typically tends to have religious undertones. Queue (haha) covid and Q Anon.

During lockdown I had an acquaintance send me a video about the pandemic. It was a Q video of course talking about all the stupid covid conspiracies. From there she sent another Q video talking about the cabal. I hadn't heard of it before, so I had no context whatsoever. I think maybe we were both so bored and stressed, it was more fun to think it was all some kind of cover up, and they subscribed to a lot of theories he and I had both entertained in the past. We've both always been somewhat of conspiracy nuts, but only in the sense that we'd read about it and be like ""oh wow that could totally be true"" then that's about it. But I've also always been the type of person who becomes obsessed with seemingly random ideas and hobbies. So I became obsessed with that. For like a few weeks I think. I don't remember what made me realize ""holy shit this is a cult and none of it is rooted in reality"" but I'm thankful I didn't stay in it long. For him, he didn't become nearly as obsessed but kinda halfway believed it for longer.

That experience taught me that it is really easy for someone to get sucked into that. My partner and I, while mentally ill, are both very intelligent people. We had both been doing well for a while, both working full time before being laid off during the pandemic. Hadn't had issues with delusions for years. Hadn't had any really concerning issues.

I think part of the reason Q has blown up so much is because people had so much free time during lockdown and everyone was experiencing a collective trauma. I think a lot of people subconsciously coped by pretending it didn't exist, and Q reinforced that idea. Q gave people something to focus on, something that seemed more interesting and scary than reality. If we think there's some baby eating satanic cult out there, it makes the reality seem less scary. It makes me sad that reality has gotten so bad that many of us rather believe fiction. And it makes me sad that so many people have gotten sucked into it.

My family is chock full of conservative Trumpers, but thankfully very few of them buy into this shit. Only my uncle, his wife, and their youngest daughter, who were never into politics before but are now so vehemently anti-vax, specifically for covid, that they were mad at the older daughter for getting a covid vaccine (it was required for her to do clinicals in nursing school). He and I obviously aren't really very close, and I've never been all that close with my extended family anyway.

I feel so sad for those who have very close family members they've lost to this. I'm so sorry you're going through that. I can't imagine. My brother is extremely intelligent and left-leaning, and I remember when I texted him with a link to a video... he asked if I've seen any actual evidence that any of that was true. I didn't have an answer, because I was convinced the evidence had been censored. But I knew then that he wasn't ""open minded"" (vulnerable) enough to believe any of it, so I didn't talk to him about it anymore. I can't imagine having pushed the issue with him.. I'm embarrassed thinking about the fact that I even brought it up with him at all lol.

He has mistreated me so badly this pregnancy and complained relentlessly about me being on pelvic rest. Hes threatened to cheat, called me names, and is just cruel. 
Ive grown such a resentment towards him and honestly this child too. 
I know its not the babys fault they are being born, but this is just another tie to a man I wish I never met. 

He was no help when I had my daughter, he slept more than I did in the hospital, brought his PlayStation with him, and hasnt grown up much since then. I was supposed to graduate college this summer and had plans on leaving him, but now I dont know what Im going to do. 

My life feels over. I feel like Im dead inside.

UPDATE/QUESTIONS ANSWERED:

OP here. I first wanted to say THANK YOU for all of your supporting comments, suggestions, and ideas. There are a lot of options I had no idea about and will be looking into.

I wanted to answer a few questions that people had:

*Why werent my tubes tied already? doctors said no. Multiple. I live in a red state that isnt big on womens reproductive rights. One doctor said Id like to have this conversation with your husband present.

*Why wasnt I on the pill? Im a hemophiliac (in simple terms, diagnosed free bleeder) it makes trying BC really hard. Some birth control makes you bleed for weeks while it regulates. Which if youre like me, can make you super sick, and its just a LOT on somebody.

*why am I with my husband now/did I know he was like this? My husband was my best friend for the 3 years we dated. He was fun, loving, and caring. After he proposed things changed slightly but I chalked it up to nerves, him making a huge career move, and growing pains. As you can guess things did not get better. I got pregnant shortly before our 1 marriage year anniversary. I was truly over the moon and he was too for a while, but by the end of my extremely hard pregnancy he had checked out mentally. Shortly after I was still working full time, in college, with plans to leave and then the pandemic happened. Affordable housing went away, daycares shut down, and I was quite literally stuck.

As much as you plan YOUR life, life has plans of it own.","TrueOffMyChest",596,596,0,0.92,1,0,0,189

I got top surgery and am on hormone therapy and have been living my life as my true self. 

Well, when I tried to tell my family things were not easy. My mother didnt want to use my preferred name so I gave her a second option but she continues to misgender me and not use the preferred names I have given. She recently bought a bottle of wine with my dead name on it during thanksgiving and presented it to me like I would appreciate it since my dead name spelled differently is a mans name in another language. 

I laughed it off and kept asking when the kids were going to arrive. Since I was told they were coming down despite my brother and I having a huge argument because he refuses to tell me where his new house is and I am not allowed to visit. My brother 34 has 4 children now and the new baby was welcomed in August. I have not met this baby, (her middle name is a Harry Potter Character) but I brought her a gift in an attempt to make peace. I have no issues with his wife other then her spineless attempts to excuse my brothers bigotry because he has said out loud he doesnt want me talking to his kids about sex. When I was only coming out as a trans man to them.

To understand better, with the first two kids I was changing their diapers. Playing with them for hours on end and the oldest misses me dearly. This was when I was in the closet. Baby 3 was born during the pandemic and I wanted to visit but they barred me from the house claiming Covid. 

Well my brother didnt show up for thanksgiving, but I called the next day and he was there with the kids. I heard the oldest ask who was on the phone.  They didnt answer her, I felt like a stranger holding the phone to my ear hearing them all play and celebrate the holiday without me. 

I made plans to return home to cut my moms hair the next day. However I was talking to a local trans artist and decided to confront my mom about what happened. 

What followed was a heart breaking phone call about my mental health and how it has declined to depression, isolation and grief. We are still mourning the loss of my oldest brother who died after thanksgiving in 2015. He would have accepted me. Now My mom feels like she is loosing another child. 

But, when I confronted my dad over the phone he proceeded to not only miss gender me and refused to call me by any name. he told me that my brother doesnt see me as anything but his sister and that they are struggling to understand because all they see me as their little girl. my dad has continuously left me out of any of the activities with my brother I wasnt allowed to go fishing wasnt allowed to go golfing and when I would join them they always complained that I was slow and I couldnt keep up and there was always a gang mentality of little girls cant play with the boys.

My dad told me in the car that gender affirming surgery would be a Mutilation of my body. 

My dad told me MY BROTHER DOESNT SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENDER AND SEXUALITY

i strongly believe my dad is to blame here. So I told my mom I will never be returning home again. She cried and asked me what she can do to help. I dont think anything can be because I cant trust my brother or father ever again. AITA?

Update: thank you all for your support I have been revolving around the guilt of coming out and its good to know that I deserve to be treated better. Also my sister in law texted me thanking me for the gift against the wishes of my brother so Im thinking Ive struck a nerve finally.

Update 2: So after blocking my father and mother from contacting me. My dad showed up unannounced to drop off my snow tires and apologize for snapping on me over the phone. Apparently he sent me an email but I blocked him long ago because his last apology was just more bigotry hidden within manipulative apologetic behaviour. I had my fiancé talk to him and deal with the tires while I cried on my patio. 

My brother says The reason he wont let me see the kids. Is all I talk about is drama and trans stuff. And I dont take the time to talk to them about positive things. 

Its absolutely nuts to think I would be so stupid to fall for this. They are uncomfortable with me being transgender and dont want me to talk about it at all even though I only came out at 30 and I just turned 33 in September. 

I have had little contact with them over Covid and saw my brother once since the start of the pandemic. He doesnt respond to text messages to me and when he does its always drama because he doesnt invite me to family event he gets our mother to invite me. Mom had to fight for me to be involved in his wedding.  Hes bullied me since I was a baby (in the youngest of 3 our older brother passed away in 2015) his wife was the only one who would share pictures or stories of the kids over text because they dont use social media. I admit i have snapped at him repeatedly, but I know its from being gaslit. Hes the one who showed our neighbour how to unlock the bathroom door while I was using it.","trans",591,591,0,0.98,0,0,1,88

I swear, Ive seen an influx of commenters (who from the looks of their profiles, arent parents, arent pregnant, arent looking to be either of those things, or worse - are men who get off on being really shitty to women) who will attack a mother/parent for how they handled a frustrating or even traumatic event. Or even a simple venting post *that they are sharing in a sub specifically geared toward people in the same stage of life*. 

For instance, a mother posted on a baby sub a few days ago that she had to surrender her cat after it dragged her small infant out of her lounger and attacked her while mom was briefly grabbing a bottle from the other room. The poor mom then was attacked so badly that blood was drawn, and 911 was called to ensure that she could safely leave her house to get medical attention.

I shit you not, cat lovers ventured out onto a sub with nothing to do with them personally to attack this woman for not going through the proper channels to get the cat help before putting it in a shelter.

While she was in the hospital. Getting stitched up. Making sure her baby was okay. After suffering from a traumatic event. 

What the fuck is with people valuing a violent pet (who definitely deserves treatment), over a literal newborn baby and postpartum mother who probably  had no choice but to remove a violent animal from her house in the quickest way possible? What is with people having nothing better to do than to actively seek out parenting subs to shit on parents when they havent done *any* of this themselves?

And another one today - a mom is venting that her husband left 3 bags of her pumped milk out overnight after she asked him to properly store it after coming home from an event with his family with their child. Several men have been on there basically manipulating this woman into thinking she has no right to complain, because at least she had a day off, and accusing her of hating men and making a huge deal out of it when she was clearly just bummed and using humor to cope.

So like I said before&. Have people ever considered just shutting the fuck up? Goddamn, I wanna throw some punches. 

Motherhood is already a struggle. Not to mention were sleep deprived, have gone through a pandemic, and continual stress and concern about the devastation and suffering happening around the world. It takes zero effort to not be an asshat, for fucks sake.

Today, its shedding **71 Billion tonnes a year**, 10x its previous melt rate. If the entire glacier were to melt, or so the article says, sea levels would rise 1.5m (almost 5 feet). 

A [new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01035-9) shed light on why Greenlands ice is melting so quickly.

Well, almost three years into the pandemic, **I finally tested positive for COVID**. After developing mild symptomsand testing negative twicemy third test came back positive. Im pretty sure I can pinpoint where, when, and how I contracted the coronavirus, and I promise you it was not worth taking off my mask. My resolve weakened for a moment, and my body has been weakened for a bit longer. Lets hope its not [the immuno-evasive nightmare variant, XBB](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-nightmare-xbb-covid-variant-that-beats-our-immunity-is-finally-here), and that I dont get lasting damage; this is (probably) my first time with COVID.

Dr. Fauci has called COVID [**a very insidious beneath-the-radar-screen public health emergency**,](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/oct/17/fauci-interview-long-covid-risk-emergency-response-coronavirus) and, in the United States, 400 people still die from/with COVID every day.

Xi Jinping was [basically confirmed for a third term](https://www.dw.com/en/china-communist-party-congress-ends-xi-jinping-set-for-third-term/a-63524684) as Chinas Presidentand [hes tripling down on the zero-COVID approach](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-63226230) that has proved controversial, but saved lives.

It indicates that asylum claims to OECD countries were up an average of 28% from 2020-2021, with particular jumps from Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Syria, and Haiti. There is very little about climate migration in the report, which is heavily &amp; inexplicably focused on international students instead.

The problem is that, in rare occasions, this vaccinewhich uses a live virus*can* mutate into a virulent form that is contagious and can potentially paralyze people who are not vaccinated. (This is how polio was theorized to have returned to New York state in the first place.) I wonder if a population whose immune systems have been weakened (say, by a respiratory virus) are at higher risk for developing a contagious polio from this oral vaccine& Asking for a friend.

As many of you recall, in the early months of the outbreak no one thought that the virus was a big deal.

*'It's just another virus, it will go away when it gets cold.'*

Well, that was before prisons and county lock-ups started to become hotspots for outbreaks. After several deaths in the state prisons, the governor of our state-authorized for *the judicial system* to allow inmates (both pre-trial and sentenced) who were at the highest risk of infection to be released. This set off a firestorm, as we started to receive multiple calls a day from family members demanding to know when their loved one was going to be released.

We explained to them that we, the detention center staff, had no authorizations for any releases. The only way to get such authorization was through the court system, so it was in their best interest to talk with a lawyer. Many of them, the inmates included, understood and reached out to their lawyers.

But this one woman took the cake.

She would call multiple times a day, demanding to know when her baby daddy (a drug dealer facing federal gun charges with NO medical issues) was going to be released. At first, we read of the prompt given to us by the Public Relations Officer (*We are sorry, we have no information at this time in regards to the Governor's Order. Please reach out to your legal representative),* but it started to escalate.

Finally one day during a busy court day, I was the one in charge of the Booking Office phones.

Me: Hello, \*\*\*\* detention center, how may I help you?

GF: WHO THE F\*\*K DO I HAVE TO TALK TO TO GET MY B-DADDY OUT OF JAIL?

Me: What is the name of the inmate?

GF: B-Daddy.

Me: Yes ma'am, he is in our custody, but he is a federal detainee. We don't have-

GF: I DON'T GIVE A S\*\*\*T WHAT YOU DON'T HAVE! THE GOVERNOR SAID THAT YOU GUYS ARE LETTING OUT INMATES! SO LET HIM THE F\*\*K OUT.

Me: Ma'am, that order applies primarily to those at severe medical risks and whose sentence can afford the dismissal. We CAN NOT release federal detainees without a court order.

GF: WHY THE F\*\*K NOT?

Me: It takes a signature for them to be placed in custody, and it takes a signature to get them out. If we were to release them without a signature, it would be considered an escape.

GF: YOU ARE F\*\*KING LYING! I WANT TO TALK TO THE SHERIFF!

I sigh, knowing I am talking to a wall, and transfer her to the admin office. Coincidentally, as I am hanging up, the guy in question is returning with the transport team and two other inmates from federal court. The guy is shaking his head and talking to the guards about how he got lucky with five years sentence instead of twenty.

Before I could stop myself I blurted out: ""Inmate, can you *please* explain to your ex that you aren't getting out of jail soon? ""

The guy just looked at me in disbelief before stating ""I *TOLD* her I was talking the plea deal today. D\*\*\*n, she just wants me to give her money again! I bet that kid isn't even mine!""

Another inmate just laughed and said 'This is why you don't stick your d\*\* in crazy.'","EntitledPeople",561,561,0,0.98,0,0,0,28

Whenever my birthday came around, it either wasn't the time (due to financial reasons) or some other major life event would prevent it (my mom getting misdiagnosed with cancer...). At first, I didn't really mind, I didn't have a party or a celebration, just my parents wishing me a good birthday and a text from my sisters. It wasn't until I realized that my birthday was the ONLY one that somehow never got celebrated at all. 

My sisters and I have a pretty big age gap (they're in their late 40's) but they always had huge parties with crazy expensive gifts like a new TV, an iPad, a laptop... I'm going to be honest here, I was (and still am) incredibly jealous, not only because of the gifts but because whenever their birthdays came around, no matter what was happening, my family still managed to get them a big party and make a big fuss about it. 

Anyway, then the pandemic happened and I didn't get a birthday again (even though both my sisters did). Now it's 2022 and my birthday is next week. I really wasn't looking forward to it since I had zero expectations at this point, but my mom made a huge deal about it since I'm turning 22. She promised me this huge party at my sister's house in the country and a good present. I kind of believed it for a bit. 

As it happens, another tragedy came by this birthday. My sister-in-law's baby was positive for Down Syndrome, and so she's choosing to terminate the pregnancy (she's almost five months along now). We all support her fully, but since these are very unhappy news my mom has been telling me to cancel the party because it would be inappropriate, but I don't want to. 

I missed having a birthday, something to look out for, and at this point I refuse to cancel it. I told her I 100% understand if SIL and brother don't want to come because they probably won't feel like it, but I'm having this party. AITA for still wanting a birthday party even in these circumstances? I know it's selfish but my mom really made me look forward to it. I feel like I need this, I've been feeling pretty neglected on this regard for a while now.","AmItheAsshole",557,557,0,0.95,0,0,0,191

As her and her husband can't afford a nanny then they need to send their kid to a nursery day care, which is around forty minutes away from our workplace. She has asked management to get in an hour later than everyone else but they declined 

The issue I'm facing is that yesterday's afternoon she asked me and other coworkers (who immediately work with her) to cover her up so she can arrive late anyway. I said no and that I would tell our supervisor if he'd ask me. She got very angry but some other people agreed with me, we can't risk out jobs because of her. It does suck that she's having it hard but it's not our fault. She called us all assholes and cried.

# 1. The Fight

Basically what happened was people started camping in front of the building to get in early. Then, in the morning, security must have told them to line up because people started *running* and that's never good since there's always a chance people will start pushing. Apparently a bunch of people who were in the front got cut off and they got upset. Things escalated to the point people started yelling insults, there was [hair pulling](https://twitter.com/MissKaylaW/status/1561066910782959616?s=20&amp;t=JX-IuP0OsiWl_rby6GudMw), crying and (apparently) someone even got chocked. Then someone brought in a taser. Just to clarify, no one got tased. The person who brought it was a fan (I'm assuming she had it for self protection in case there were creeps on the way to and back from the show.) and she used it for crowd control. It worked since the crowd dispersed immediately after.

Now, one, I do not agree with what the fan did. I understand she did it with good intentions *but* using a taser seems very unnecessary. Yes, it worked and the fight probably would have escalated more if she hadn't done it but it was also very dangerous and she could've hurt someone badly. Honestly, it wasn't her place to do so. Two, the venue should've had security watching over the crowd. The fact that there was no one stopping the fight and a taser had to be involved is very irresponsible on the management's part. They should not have been understaffed for an event like this.

# 2. Trash

People left trash after camping and on the sidewalks which is just disrespectful. I'm sure if you're old enough to attend Kcon, you're also mature enough to understand that leaving your trash everywhere is not okay. Just because there's staff there who'll probably clean up the place after the event doesn't mean you can't be a decent human being and make their job a little easier.

People were also [standing](https://twitter.com/hearteyessehun/status/1561282564341374976?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) on trash cans to take pictures and get idols to [notice](https://twitter.com/prettypurki/status/1561218853903814661?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) them. Do I even need to explain why this is wrong?

# 3. The Setlist

This was a huge deal because fans were upset that their groups only preformed 3-4 songs whereas Ateez preformed 8 songs. To my knowledge, the management gave each group the same amount of time for their stages. It was up to them to choose how they wanted to fill that time. Let's say the time limit was 30 minutes. Assuming a song is around 3 minutes, the other groups spent around 21 minutes to change clothes, interact with fans, play games, etc. Which is fine, it's normal and they deserve some break time after preforming. I'm sure the fans loved it too and were happy to be interacting with their idols.

Ateez technically preformed 7 songs since their song ""Poppia"" is Kcon's signature song and they most likely got extra time for it. For the rest of the 7 songs, they decided to preform them back to back. This means they had about 9 minutes to change outfits, interact with fans, take a break, etc. It wasn't like Ateez got better treatment, they just had different priorities and managed the time according to it.

Ateez did their best too. They were all [sweating](https://twitter.com/minghuiarte/status/1561340222134259712?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) heavily. San had [black streaks](https://twitter.com/gorgeousanie_/status/1561273840495431682?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) on his [face](https://twitter.com/gorgeousanie_/status/1561207896842674178?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) because he was sweating so much his hair dye melted, his [mic](https://twitter.com/sankaissed/status/1561201333327527936?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) fell off [during](https://twitter.com/vasilissaadair/status/1561230064997453824?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) Rocky and [broke](https://twitter.com/sanippuding/status/1561213752128679936?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) during Hala Hala (again). A lot of fans apparently walked out as baby Atinys.

Side note : [Wooyoung](https://www.tiktok.com/@berainbecloud/video/7134218854963727643) calling San pabo while helping him with his makeup. Ateez's [makeup artist](https://twitter.com/sandorokis/status/1561232742523645953?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) and [stylist](https://twitter.com/sandorokis/status/1561223712514252802?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) were crying because of San. And finally, San saying that he [carries](https://twitter.com/sandorokis/status/1561254867204657152?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g) 3 mics with him just in case.

# Conclusion

Honestly, Kcon LA was just a mess. It was very understaffed. The fans there were so rude and disrespectful. Like I understand wanting to meet your idols after a pandemic but things did not need to be this bad. There were also problems I didn't touch on like the mistreatment of people with [disabilities](https://twitter.com/jisungflwr/status/1561144186312675328?s=20&amp;t=6Xk-X9lwWVQ-N9UGOV3N0g). I really hope Day 2 goes better.

I didn't know it would be a pandemic per say but I knew it would be something that would change everyone's way of life which would more than likely be biological/sickness related.

Some who did not know this are probably like GTFOH and BS.  Well it's in the archives below for you to read yourself.

All are welcome to contact me at: i_reddit_for_lulz2@protonmail.com &lt;-- please note that I will answer all emails just give me time.

* Since we are so deep in comments and questions, I'm going to start posting some intimate details concerning what I've been up to over the past 6 years shortly.

**What have I been up to over the past 6 years?**

* After that last AMA nothing happened, it was quiet.  About a day or so later I made a comment which seemed tame compared to what was divulged in the AMA.  Well I got a phone call to the security setup I had at the time which I didn't mind but My father also received a call.

* I come from a pretty traditional family, where as I've been really the only one a bit over the edge, extending myself to help others etc., which many don't from my economic class.

* I will just say I'm old enough to be many of you alls Grandfather, so my father was already up in age.  Now he is bedridden most of the time.  He doesn't speak to me much which hurts quite a bit.  It wasn't just because of the AMA, it was built up over time.

* So... moving on from that, I've been traveling the world since then.  From Damascas to Nepal, over to Cambodia, Brazil And many places in the U.S., Chicago, Arizona, California etc.

* I've met some really interesting people along the way, done sweat lodges, been through shaminic rituals and more.  &lt;--- this is what I've been doing and into since I was young... hence my father's last straw kinda deal since he is a very conservative Christian.  Kinda shocked me really.

* I'm on the Internet just as much as many of you at times and see the comments, the joys and sorrows.  Which is why for this AMA I focused more on personal help, and guidance verses just strictly secret tech, etc.  Because does that really matter?  

* This is what I asked myself after the last AMA, what benefit to the greater /r/conspiracy community did it really do?  Yes I had access and was shown mind blowing situations.  But overall it did not have a great effect on what I deemed most important.  Which was the personal liberation one could say.  This is what I meant within the original AMA when I was stating I'm waiting for 'thee' question.  As it would have opened up the can of worms we are exploring together today.

* I hope that most of you at least can appreciate the growth within myself.  As I have found peace.

* I will also provide links concerning what has helped me throughout this journey.  Which may be music, books, supplements, places to visit etc.

**Technology**

* The intelligence gathering and/or consciousness disrupting technology is so advance that most of my sources still in the hive don't have cell phones at all and only have one computer that is ever hooked to the internet.  It would be smart to deploy similar tactics.

* Because of what has and is being sprayed in our skies, everyone should be wearing a level 3 hazmat suit when going out into the public.  Especially in cities where this chemical debris is more concentrated. 

**Slabs**

* You will not be getting an invite, so prepare to be on the surface with the horde and prepare accordingly. 

* Many are waiting for the news to state the the grid is down (lawlessness) so they can cause terror.  Authorized terror.  Speak to your neighbors, gather with your family and friends and have each others back.  I am trained but one man alone is one man alone.  Numbers never hurt if everyone is on the same page.

**Agents**

* Disruptive agents, rather they are on payroll or just fulfilling some inner issue are of course on Reddit.  But the paid version is all throughout /r/conspiracy.  

* If you go back to the original AMA you will see tons of people just being argumentative, disrespectful etc.  Instead of just asking a question or making a meaningful comment.  *If you notice, the same thing has happened in this thread.*  I've answered over 1100 comments and questions and growing.  And yet they still have so much negativity to say and spread.  This is not to upset me... nope... it is to dis-sway you.  To get you to turn away before you read something that may change your life forever.  This is there purpose.  To prevent the One. 

* The reason why they do this is because they have to disrupt ANY forum, gathering, communication that brings people together and/or may lead to certain levels of awareness.  Period!  This is so serious that even Reddit Admins have been caught red handed doing this. https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5el6ea/reddit_admins_caught_editing_users_posts/

* Reddit probably has the most out of any other forum on the internet (excluding 4chan).  Any idea's, direct substantial criticism is cataloged and brought up the chain.  Shortly after you will see commercials or even your favorite TV show cover some random topic that you're like why the heck did they just say or or have a whole episode about that?

**Food**

* By all means it is of extreme importance that you grow your own food.  Even if this is on a small apartment balcony.  Learn how to grow.  And buy as many seeds as possible as they will be a form of currency.

**The Realm**

* There are many places that are out yonder which are no longer on modern maps.  If you want a life of freedom, while experiencing circumstances that others couldn't even dream of.  Find a way there.  The journey more than likely won't be easy.  Military is aware and will capture or destroy anyone who attempts to escape to the outer colonies.  If you're resourceful you'll be able to survive once you arrive.  The way underground is many times more dangerous than above due to earthquakes, flooding, cave-ins etc., but you wouldn't have to worry about the world army guarding the door.

**The Blackout**

* When the blackout happens if the timeline continues as such, it will be cover for mass murder, but particularly assassinations of many key targets which will include many of the adults and those of older age (grand parents).  Which will leave an abundance of young people/children to be ushered into the new world without the pain of what once was.  To be programmed with the new religion as well as the freedom to choose whatever they wish to be.  Which we are all seeing happen in its primal form already.

**EDIT 9 at June 8th 2022 - at 6:25pm HST**

**Compassion**

* People are going through a lot all across the realm.  You should be wise and keep your wits, but a ""hello"", ""keep your head up"", ""have a wonderful day"" to a unknown being passing by could change their day for the better which can spring forth greater possibilities. 

* This is the time of if you have a skill, share it with those willing to learn.  Don't be disheartened by the trolls.

* Again people have been through a lot, but guess what?  This is nothing new, what we are experiencing collectively has been going on to other demographics for generations.  Reserve bias and judgement.  Extend understanding.


**Fear**

* Easier said then done, but do not fear.  Fear leads to suffering of some kind.

* Understanding reality does not equal fear.  Internalizing what you're reading rather it be from the news, or even a post like this, can lead to it.  Learn to separate your internal state from the external world.  This will serve you well in time.


**Relax**

* Learn to meditate.  It is simple.  Find a comfortable place, close your eyes, breath in fully, hold your breathe for 1-3 seconds, then breath out fully.  Repeat this over and over.  This is called rhythmic breathing.  Even if you have music playing, or if there is construction going on outside your doors, focus on your breath.

* Meditation such as above, will allow you to de-stress.  You can do this anywhere, at work, in the car etc.  I've been meditating for over 30 years which has allowed the opening of many gifts.


**Get to it!**

* This is not the time to sit around, crying and complaining. This is the time to get things done.  So get em done.  Is there anything on your to do list that you can do right now but have been putting it off?  Well do it now!  No complaints, no excuses, just do it.


**Energy Exchange**

* Everyone is not against you, but everyone is not for you.  Don't allow someone to just use you, but don't use someone yourself.  In the coming months look to find common threads for mutual energetic exchanges. 


**Religion / Spirituality**

* The nature of the word Religion is to Re-align.  Meaning realigning oneself with proper practices and procedures so that the internal state can flourish.  Even though there are many lies amongst us and liars to boot.  Don't be ashamed if you find solace within XYZ religion.  If it helps you to become a better person and keep you strong, who am I or anyone else to judge?


**Money / Living Space**

* As we are in times where families are struggling. This would be my suggestions to save money and to keep a roof over your head.

* Live together!  Yes... I'm not saying invite everyone to live with you or you live with them.  What I'm saying is those people you do get along with, if able find a place with enough space for you all.  And live together and share expenses.  As many as you are able as this will continue to lower everyone's expenses.  

* This is how you beat inflation.  By lowering your expenses which in turn increases the amount of income you're able to hold on to.  I'm sure this makes sense right?
	
* The attack is coming from every angle, but there are smart people here with you.  And solutions can be had, my only advice would be to be careful about what you state on the internet as it will be used against everyone like the GME situation.

**EDIT 10 at June 9th 2022 - at 6:20am HST**

* Many are asking for any recommendations.  So I looked in my library and here is an important one.

* Book: Nutrition and Physical Degeneration by, Weston A Price, DDS - https://www.amazon.com/Nutrition-Physical-Degeneration-Weston-Price/dp/0916764206/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1AL65VQR2CJKH&amp;keywords=weston+a+price+nutrition+and+physical+degeneration&amp;qid=1654791953&amp;sprefix=weston+a+price%2Caps%2C439&amp;sr=8-1

* This is probably the most important book still available to the public that shows real pictures of malnutrition brought on by those who wish to do harm to humanity.  This is affecting I would say 99% of the people who are reading my words.  

* Every system of the body has effect on every other system.  For example if your teeth grew in crooked (most people in the western world and those the world has infected.), well that means the connections within the brain are also screwed up or misfiring. 

* Think of two of the same people.  But copy A everything came in as it should, a perfect specimen of a human no matter what race, gender they would be.  Well Copy B, teeth are crooked, so face is malformed, connections to brain are screwed up.  This of course affects the development of other bodily systems as well.  Kidneys, Heart etc.  Which of these copies would you put money on to be the best in life?  You see.  

*  This is not in the book but vaccines are literally causing many babies to have strokes. &lt;--- This may sound absolutely ridiculous to some of you.  Since some have this immediate knee jerking reaction to new thoughts.  But look at the facial structure of stroke victims, the droopy eye etc.  Now compare these pictures to babies/children before and after they receive the series of vaccines.  If you make your heart palpitate.  Slurred speech, etc.. etc.  The same symptoms in adult stroke victims you will see in children in mass who have all been vaccinated. 

**All are welcome to contact me at: i_reddit_for_lulz2@protonmail.com &lt;-- please note that I will answer all emails just give me time.**

* Many of you have sent over really long and detailed emails.  I will respond but it will most definitely take me some time.  

* Some one here (Spacequest89) created a post calling me a scammer and that I'm not the original.  Well have you heard of the Streisand effect (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect)?  

* Well in your obsession you have caused even more people to contact me, and visit this post and find help.  So I thank you for being strangely overzealous in your pursuit with trying to prove I'm not the original i_reddit_for_lulz which is strange because there is no way for you to truly know.  I guess I'm just here answering over 1400 comments/questions to imitate.... yeah buddy sure.  But thank you!

* The regular AMA was supposed to be Saturday, but we have went deep into many topics before hand.  I'm attempting to setup a actual internet based call for the AMA but my opsec has to be secure for it, so we will see!

* This is a free platform so I'm not sure how well it will do, but we will attempt to give this a solid go. I'm signed in now, but won't be saying much until then.

**EDIT 13 at June 12th 2022 - at 11:58am HST**

* We had almost a 4 hour AMA yesterday.  It was a pleasure speaking to all of you.

* What I hope is that this time around, instead of the focus on technology, you received a push toward becoming the best version of yourself.  

* That all is not lost.  

* That you do indeed have someone out here pushing for you.  

* And that the path may not be easy, but you can do it.

* That it is of high importance you do not allow humanities adversaries, the deep state, etc., to divide us.  Do not walk around with bias and anger within you, this is not your (at least most of you) natural state.  


***This post will be deleted as well as my account on Wednesday June 15th, 2022 at 11:59pm HST***

* I wish all of you who were honest and open, strength during these times.

Farewell, friends.

&gt; Are there any important dates that we should be aware of that change the way we live? You dont have to give a specific date, maybe a specific month and year we should look out for?

Friend, we are already in deep dudu.

***Watch out for next winter and all throughout the summer of 2023***

Arm yourself, exercise. 

It's better to eat smaller meals that are very healthy than large meals that fill the belly but are of low quality.  

***I suggest you get used to it now.***

Remember, your neighbor ***is not*** your enemy.  But there is an enemy amongst your neighbors.

***Lastly*** speak up now, on your block, in your city, in town halls, creating your own protest etc., before it's too late because everything would be in chaos.

*  I find it odd that there are few odd people who seem to be really angry that this topic is here and so many have enjoyed it.  I mean really angry!

* This is the same thing that happened in the first one, most enjoyed it, others looked at it as purely entertainment, but there was that few who were absolutely pissed.  Trying to find any fault or discrepancy to highlight and go on tangents about.

* Stay focused, friends.  There are many out here just as you, who are becoming stronger, wiser, and doing what's needed to create the better reality for all.

* I'm still working through quite a few emails.  So if you emailed, no worries, I will respond.

* I'll be gone from reddit for a few weeks as another adventure awaits.  I'll still be checking emails and responding to DMs when time allows.

* The Water Wars will begin soon.  Exactly how soon is soon, I can't tell you.

* For reference check out Lake Mead.

* The dissipation of Lake Mead is not 100% of natural reasons.  And not just for Big ARGO either.  Since ***they*** know the water wars will begin soon which means famine.  ***They*** are draining fresh water sources.

* You have been warned.

* Many of you remember the area I went into in the previous archives that had the invisible cloaked like entrance.  

* Well, years ago there weren't any examples of it in the public.  Well now they're starting to come out with it on a smaller, much inferior scale.  https://imgur.com/a/1RTZHCO

* Through my contacts I have learned that a lot of the missing and quickly depleting water supply in USA is due to deliberate draining of the aquifers. I can't say a lot about this except, map out all the locations of water siphoning companies such as Pepsi Co and the **many** others.  A lot of this water, verified by actual corporate documents and recordings is not going to the public for retail.

* This is just one angle of the water issues, it's a multi-limbed beast and it's hungry!

The global food shortage worsens, oil hits new highs, and Russias pressure in the Donbas grows&

This is *Last Week in Collapse*, a long post I make at the end of every week, compiling some of the most important, depressing, surprising, ironic, demoralizing, helpful, timely, or otherwise must-see events in Collapse. Im here to refill your weekly prescription of Doom.

This is the 24th newsletter. Last weeks newsletter (May 28-June 3) is [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/v4pl0h/last_week_in_collapse_may_28june_3_2022/) if you missed it. You can also &gt;!find these newsletters now [for free (for now) **on SubStack**](https://substack.com/profile/18092228-last-week-in-collapse), or sent to your email inbox.!&lt;

It was a rough week. Sri Lanka continues to be beset by [**protests, currency collapse, and food shortages**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKD-hNcSuHA). You can watch a [relatively tame protest here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP95Ff1OzYg) if you want. Unstructured civil disobedience meets restrained law enforcement. Is this what the early stages of Collapse look like?

Elsewhere across the world, inflation/supply shortage/food [protests are popping off](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/surging-food-prices-fuel-protests-across-developing-world-2022-05-18/). The risk of an Everything Spring (like the Arab Spring, but global) is high, according to [this report](https://encyclopediageopolitica.com/2022/06/10/the-everywhere-spring-food-insecurity-and-civil-unrest-on-a-global-scale/). The food crisis will [be worse](https://nypost.com/2022/06/08/food-shortages-could-be-just-as-deadly-as-global-pandemic/) than the COVID pandemic, according to some. For many, [it is already](https://www.thenation.com/article/environment/baby-formula-climate-crisis/) or [it has always been](https://www.wfp.org/stories/hunger-famine-and-starvation-750000-people-are-front-line-un-study-says) this way. Argentina, the worlds [7th largest wheat exporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wheat_exports) is looking at [an exceptionally bad wheat harvest](https://www.batimes.com.ar/news/economy/argentina-set-for-worst-wheat-season-in-12-years.phtml) this year. 

More [**heat waves**](https://www.axios.com/2022/06/09/heat-wave-southwest-phoenix-vegas-california) struck Mexico/US just as the [wildfire season is starting](https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/10/weather/southern-california-wildfire-season/index.html). The greater Middle East is [also facing extreme temperatures](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1534969819648380928), alongside [Morocco, Spain, and Portugal](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1534929867405692928).

[97% of Portugal is in severe drought](https://www.euronews.com/green/2022/06/10/nearly-all-of-portugal-in-severe-drought-after-hottest-may-on-record), and theyre not alone. The Horn of Africa is in the [throes of megadrought](https://africa.cgtn.com/2022/06/10/millions-face-threat-of-starvation-amid-unprecedented-drought-in-horn-of-africa-report/), and the upcoming [Indian monsoon season](https://www.dw.com/en/farmers-in-india-fear-irregular-monsoon-amid-summer-heat-and-drought/a-62091260) is feared to be irregular. Are there any reliable climatic pattern models for the next 20 years, or is it just too unpredictable?

Downstream of the drought lies an [ongoing worldwide food crisis](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/11/ukraines-zelenskyy-on-food-crisis-prices-amid-war-with-russia.html), linked to the Ukraine War, our supply chain mishaps, topsoil erosion, drought/heat waves, oil shortage, and economic instability. Twice a year, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) releases [a report](https://www.fao.org/newsroom/detail/new-un-food-outlook-report-world-s-most-vulnerable-are-paying-more-for-less-food/en) on the State of Food across Earth. The June 9th report is not optimistic.

[Long-COVID](https://www.news9live.com/health/covid-19/long-covid-emerging-as-parallel-epidemic-can-prove-fatal-if-symptoms-are-ignored-175298) is emerging as a **parallel epidemic** and it can have deadly consequences. Yet most people are living in complete ignorance or denial of this condition, possessed by the false imperative to return to the way things were, as if that were remotely possible. Invisible COVID [waves](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/06/this-new-covid-wave-may-be-more-like-a-flood.html) rise as precautions are dropped.

Although countries like [India](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/is-new-covid-19-surge-an-alarm-for-4th-wave-top-health-expert-answers-101654794135813.html), [North Korea](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/6/2/covid-amid-food-insecurity-a-perfect-storm-is-brewing-in-n-korea), and [Brazil](https://brazilian.report/liveblog/2022/06/06/data-issues-covid-rise/) are seeing surges in new cases, some countries, like the U.S., have now [stopped requiring negative tests](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/10/biden-administration-to-drop-covid-testing-requirements-for-international-air-travel.html) for entry into the country.

Confirmed **monkeypox** cases worldwide (excluding West/Central Africa, where it is endemic) were 915 at the end of last week. The case count has now [reached **1,576**](https://bnonews.com/monkeypox/), as of publication. Ghana, Israel, Brazil, Morocco, Poland&new countries are added every week. Read more about [the symptoms, 7-14 day incubation, CFR, and virus duration](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/clinicians/clinical-recognition.html) from the CDC if youre interested.

[Two different monkeypox strains](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/two-monkeypox-variants-found-us-rcna31894) have been detected in the United States&if the two variants are not linked to each other, as the article says, then the US just happened to get two different monkeypox outbreaks simultaneouslyor something else is going on. Is it too early or taboo to talk about the possibility of bioweapons?

You can run, but you cant hide from microplastics. They were [found in Antarctica snow](https://interestingengineering.com/microplastics-antarctica-snow-first-time) in 2019 according to a journal released last Wednesday. I found a thin piece of plastic in a bag of frozen peppers this week.

The economy is in big trouble, as you all know. The US corporate default rate is expected to [hit 10%](https://www.ft.com/content/0239a35f-53f7-4d96-b39a-417ff2bc7db7). Truckers [in South Korea](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/south-korean-truckers-strike-enters-third-day-supply-chain-risks-grow-2022-06-09/) and airport [workers in France](https://www.thelocal.fr/20220608/breaking-quarter-of-paris-flights-cancelled-due-to-strike/) went on strike, part of a global logistics breakdown. The price of bread in Zimbabwe [rose 70%](https://www.newzimbabwe.com/bread-prices-jump-70-in-zimbabwe-as-economic-crisis-worsens/) *in one week*. This is the New Normal"". 

The price of crude oil hit $121/barrel this week, and [its probably going to hit $150](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/oil-prices-150-per-barrel-demand-destruction-trafigura-ceo-2022-6) by the years end. You can imagine what that will do to the price at the pump, and for domestic unrest. Some [analysts think](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/EIA-Warns-Of-Substantial-Fall-In-Russian-Oil-Production.html) Russias oil production will never again hit 2021 production levels.

Russians continued their push for the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. Zelenskyy says that if the city of [Sievierodonetsk](https://earth.google.com/web/@48.93951144,38.68510037,137.39547237a,173013.33717166d,35y,359.99998053h,0t,0r/data=ClkaVxJRCiUweDQxMjAxMGYyODI2NGZjMTc6MHhkMzJjNWYzZWNiOTExMmMyKihTZXZlcm9kb25ldHNrCtCh0ZTQstGU0YDQvtC00L7QvdC10YbRjNC6GAIgAQ) (pre-War pop: 101,000) falls, [it wont get liberated](https://www.newsweek.com/zelensky-says-counter-offensive-recapture-severodonetsk-too-costly-1713297). Mariupol, which fell to Russian soldiers a few weeks ago, is now [at risk of a huge cholera outbreak](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61762787). Cholera is a bacterial food/water-borne illness that kills within days.

It is currently estimated that [100-200 Ukrainian soldiers are killed every day](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-61742736). These [maps](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506682) show the advance of Russian soldiers across the east, where the fighting is fiercest. According to a Ukrainian intel official, [**This is an artillery war now.**](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/10/were-almost-out-of-ammunition-and-relying-on-western-arms-says-ukraine). 

President Putin more-or-less [confirmed](https://www.businessinsider.com/putin-says-ukraine-war-seize-land-russia-undermines-rationale-2022-6) what everyone already knows: the Ukraine War was (re)started as a push to reform the Russian Empire, not out of an attempt to prevent genocide of Russians by neo-nazi Ukrainians, as Putin claimed in February. The transparent pretext never really mattered anyway.

China [warned](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61768875) againthat Taiwan declaring its independence would lead to War. China has been growing [more coercive and aggressive](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/11/china-is-becoming-more-coercive-and-aggressive-us-defense-chief.html) across its expanding sphere of influence, according to American officials. [War-gaming the situation](https://archive.ph/BZOUe) is a complex affair.

The United States government began [the primetime hearings](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/10/1104103404/new-revelations-and-other-takeaways-from-first-jan-6-committee-hearing) about the January 6th, 2021 attempted coup. It has already been spun as a partisan show trial that serves to further calcify the two political camps dominating &amp; dividing American life. New testimony &amp; video will not change the unfortunate political reality. President Bidens [approval rating](https://www.cookpolitical.com/analysis/national/national-politics/two-different-paths-41) is similar to Trumps. Bolivia, on the other hand, [sentenced an ex-President](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-61767387) to 10 years in prison for attempting a coup.


Select comments/threads from the subreddit last week suggest:

- **Collapse = skilled people quitting,** according to [this comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/v5zgj3/weekly_observations_what_signs_of_collapse_do_you/ibmlqyw/) about a rural American hospital. But its not just the US; [Lebanon is losing healthcare staff](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2022/06/05/1102214169/lebanons-hospitals-are-running-out-of-medicine-and-staff-in-ongoing-economic-cri), too. The healthcare system in the U.S. [is broken](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/v5h2xm/we_are_absolutely_destroyed_health_workers_facing/), and nobody is coming to fix it.

So I began my position in January 2020. Weird interview process, my boss is strange. But whatever, if she leaves me alone I can do my job. Horrible training, I taught myself almost everything. Covid happened, sent home to work remotely. No reason we couldn't have been at home anyways.. I worked from home 2.5 months after starting the role and quickly became the top performer on the team. Woot! I have the largest account in the company, and was given more vendors as well because I could handle them. 

Fast forward to 2021, they've been saying we'd be back in the office ""in no time"" for over a year. (Despite management downplaying it and even suggesting it was a hoax, president of the company wasn't an idiot.) We didn't need to be there and we all worked better from home, as they even told us countless times. Told ""you weren't hired to work from home"", but none of us were thrilled about going in to help justify middle management's necessity or their newly renovated, empty office space. 

Mid 2021, husband and I decide to start trying and get pregnant right away. My boss suggests we all go in soon because ""covid is practically gone."" Pregnancy goes by, continue working from home. They keep saying that'll change. Finally they say you have to come in 2 days a week. I'm 38 weeks pregnant at that point. Nope. Got a doctor's note. They were pissed, but can't argue with it. 

They finally found a temp replacement when I was already 37 weeks pregnant and made me train her. Last minute as hell. Sure. Then she quit. Found another, I had 3 days to train this woman in a job that takes people months to learn. Whatever. 

Have baby, enjoy leave, blah blah blah. Monday comes that I'm supposed to start back. Come back to over 900 emails, no word from boss for hours on first day. I find out my temp replacement quit after a week because she couldn't handle the workload. Handling baby and laptop like a champ, whatever it takes. 

Boss finally calls me, says hello. She mentions how the team is falling apart (most of the team is older and not in good health), and how we weren't approved for an additional hire that we desperately need. Okay. No mention of coming in. Got an email later asking which 2 days I'm coming in. I replied ""I'm not comfortable, willing, or able to physically come into the office"". 

Next morning my boss's boss calls me and doesn't say hello, welcome back, nothing. She says, ""it is company policy to come into the office 2 days a week. If you do not come in, we will consider it your resignation"". I froze and didn't know what to say. Husband and I agreed: let them fire you. You're not quitting. She goes on that they can't make an exception, it's above her (we were told before it wasn't, it's up to each department). She says I need to find childcare, I can't do both. They'll give me until Tuesday next week to figure it out or resign. 

It's Monday night. Just sent an email shitting on them and how they've handled everything- my pregnancy, my return, the pandemic, being short staffed. Said I'm surprised they'd even consider losing me with my workload and recent turnover in mind. I'm not resigning. I'll continue to work at home until they say otherwise and my access is revoked. It could go either way, and I don't care either way.

Tldr: new mom, 3 months postpartum. First day back to work last Monday. Remote since pandemic, only hired 2 months before that. Top performer on team. Not planning on going into office. Told it's ""policy"" and they'll accept my resignation. I'm not quitting...

EDIT: Small Tuesday Evening Update.
So I haven't posted anything yet cuz there was no update. I fully expected to log on and clock in this morning to a termination email and that would be that. Honestly, I was kinda looking forward to it! Not the case. Radio silence. Nothing. And still nothing. Actually, my boss emailed me this afternoon about some small client issue as if nothing happened. Not sure what to make of that...

Neither of us were sure about having kids. We were married 5 years before finding out she was pregnant. Both nervous as hell but in the end, she wanted to try having the baby and I agreed. It was hard at first. Parenthood is in general but I love my son. Hes wonderful, smart, energetic and warms my heart. My wife for the most part was great with him. Occasionally we both would get burned out and find some time to have date nights or individual free time.

Over a year ago before lockdown, my wife started becoming very irritated over anything hed do. Accidentally spill a little apple juice on the counter shed yell at him like if hed just destroyed a family heirloom. It was something that happened every now and then but wed talk about it, and she would apologize to him.

Pandemic was really rough. We both had our jobs, just were working from home and our son wasnt in school. At first I thought the frustration came from being cooped up at home and not being able to go out. My sons been going to school again for months, and were all back to going out. Things havent improved.

Finally had a sit down with my wife because no matter what mood shes in- she could be happy and smiling - but when my son comes in her mood shifts. And I notice it more now. My wife has told me that for the longest time, shes resented having our son. Motherhood isnt what she thought it was going to be and missed it only being the two of us. She didnt expect her life to be this way with a child, and she regrets having him at all. It was a hard conversation to have but one we really needed to. Ive talked to her about getting therapy (individual, couples, or both) whatever it takes. Shes refused because she claims she doesnt need help.

We have tried going on more date nights, being a couple if she feels like were not getting enough of that. Have her spend some more one on one time with him (which she doesnt want to do). It doesnt matter, as soon as we get home and in our sons presence shes more serious. I asked her once does she love him. My wife says that she does, just doesnt like him. That was painful. I want to work on this with her, get therapy. She doesnt want to. Whats pushing me to wanna leave is because my son is starting to pick up on this. No 7 year old kid should be asking why moms always mad at him. I love my wife but Im scared of him growing up with someone who doesnt like him. Is this really it? Is the next best thing to leave or is there any way to get her to understand I can't have our son living like this?

Well its been a hard few days but it happened. Didnt want it to but it needed to. I took my son out of there. Trying to talk with my wife about this a couple days after posting this got us nowhere. Even if therapy wasnt going to be the miracle that makes her want to be a mother to our son, I told her it wouldnt hurt to have somewhere to talk about her feelings. Get to the core of why she feels this way and if maybe theres a way to work on it so that it wouldnt have a deep impact on how she is with him.

She refused. And I asked her does she ever think it will get better. As in does my wife believe she could see herself caring for him and being what he needs at all in the future. The answer wasnt going to determine if I left or not but thats something I just wanted to know for myself. She said no. When I told her that its not going to work out between us because his well-being comes first she begged me to stay. All these promises of not treating him negatively and putting on a face for him but still will not do therapy at all because she doesnt need help. Then all of a sudden she gets angry. And to get out then if I only just want to be with my son. It was heartbreaking. We ended up leaving since she didnt want to leave the apartment. He was still half asleep when we left so all Ive told him so far is were just taking a short vacation. He believes it since were staying at a hotel for now but he does keep asking about her. Im trying my best to keep it together for him, my hearts still broken though. I hate that it had to end like this. But many of you were right, and I know this too. He had to come first and this was already messing him up. I know it was the right choice. Feels like my life just came to a hard stop. And Im just trying to get my bearings still.

She hasnt contacted me since we left. My family is aware of whats happening though so Im glad to have their support. My sister offered to have my son spend the weekend with them so he could be with his cousins. Since hes not here right now I decided to use some of my free time to type this up. Thank you for being the push I needed to do something . Deep down I know it was what needed to be done. Guess just needed it to be said.","BestofRedditorUpdates",22439,22439,0,0.95,2,0,3,1858

Yesterday I went to a Dallas, TX ER. About ten minutes after I woke up that morning I collapsed as sudden, sharp, pain started spreading from my lower left abdomen. It was *excruciating*. I have a very high pain tolerance, and I couldn't speak, or stand up, or walk. All I could do was writhe and cry and vomit in agony. I've had an ovarian torsion that required surgery before, as well as several instances of ruptured ovarian cysts that caused full-on internal bleeding. This felt like that.

My husband called 911 for an ambulance, as he did not believe he could get me safely to the car and drive with me in that condition.

The EMTs wouldn't even look at me and clearly didn't want to take me to the hospital. You see - we just moved, and the neighborhood is poor. I have 'locked hair, piercings, and tattoos and I wasn't obviously gushing blood from something like a gunshot wound. They quite clearly assumed I was faking and drug-seeking.

And the rest of the day got no better.

These medical professionals let me writhe in agony for well over an hour while they grilled me about whether I was pregnant or not, over and over. Ironically - I'd actually really love to have another baby, but I had to be surgical sterilized (cauterized tubes) for my own safety over a decade ago. AND I haven't had sex in six months, which my husband confirmed for them at my bedside. None of those facts, or that trauma mattered to them. They angrily demanded that I *stand up* and go do their piss-test. I had to remind them, nearly screaming, that I couldn't stand up or walk and they begrudgingly and resentfully got me a bedpan.

All my blood and urine work came back clean because *of course it did*. I am not pregnant, and I wasn't on any illicit substances.

They did finally, at this point, provide a small amount of pain relief.

They did an ultrasound. They CT'd my abdomen.

And much later an exasperated male doctor comes back to tell me I have a UTI. I know my body - this was *not* solely a UTI. I said as much, and restated my history.

Friends, I shit you not, this is what he said to me (pissily):

""Well, *yes*, we found ruptured hemorrhagic cysts on your ovaries. And *I guess maybe* that could've caused your pain. I don't know. But there's no way to be sure. There's nothing we can do for you - we're discharging you.""

As you might imagine - I have concerns at this point. I've been through this before, and both the internal bleeding and the recovery pain are things I wanted clearly addressed by the staff before I left.

Despite my pain and the medication, I was calm and very polite as I tried to ask my questions. The doctor just walked away. And when I tried to ask my nurse she literally wouldn't stop interrupting me to talk over me. When my husband asked her why she wouldn't let me speak, she literally threw up her hands and said she wasn't going to talk to us anymore and walked out. I was discharged, and I needed to *fucking leave*.

When my husband asked for a Patient Advocate, no one would acknowledge the request or even look at him. We didn't get a patient advocate, despite asking multiple times.

There was nothing to do but leave. Despite my medical history, proof of currently rupturing cysts on my ovaries, and clean drug tests - they still treated me like an addict using them to get high. And the second I wasn't pregnant, they didn't give a single flying fuck. I was a living incubator, or a drug addict, or both. And they didn't let me be anything else - I couldn't just be a person in crisis who needed help.

They didn't even note the ruptured cysts they found on my discharge paperwork - just the UTI.

I don't want to hear excuses about the pandemic or worker burnout. It simply *isn't* an excuse. If you can't do your job without punching down on sick people *it's on you to find a new job*. Period.

The woman who personally performed my ultrasound, and the gentleman who directly performed my CT were both kind, empathetic people who obviously did their best. Being decent is clearly still possible.

No one else chose to be decent yesterday at DALLAS REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER.

I would tell you all to please be safe, but I don't really know how that's possible all things considered. Be aware, if nothing else, of how little you matter to these people.

Edited to add: We have insurance, so that certainly wasn't the issue here.

The baby is also the first grandchild/nephew of my husband's family which everyone is excited about.

 I lost my mother and father to the pandemic, being an only child, so there's not much of my family. Since the death of my parents (1 year ago), my husband's family has welcomed me with open arms as part of them and I have become very close to my MIL and SIL. 

I always wanted to have a gender reveal and I trusted my SIL to organize everything about this.

With 3 days to go before the party, I started to receive messages from all my husband's relatives and even close friends congratulating me on my baby being a boy. 

I went to ask what happened, my SIL confessed that she let it slip to my MIL and she told everyone the sex of the baby after knowing, because she couldn't hold it and it took proportions beyond what they imagined. Nobody call me to tell this. 

The party was canceled and I was heartbroken, as well as extremely hurt by the two of them.

 Usually they accompanied me to the ultrasound, shopping for the baby' room and my MIL would stay at the time of delivery. 

But after this breach of trust, I stopped inviting them and asked them to respect my boundaries when they pressured me to go. Honestly, I didn't even send them the baby shower invite, because I really avoided contact with them as much as possible. Because everyone knew before me that it was a boy. 

My husband started complaining that I was pushing them away because of a mistake that could happen and that I was being harsh. 

Yesterday he brought up this and when I said that I still didn't feel comfortable with them, he said ""Soon you'll tell me that my mother won't be able to go to the birth "".

 I think my face showed my response and he started saying I was being too hard on her because she was just excited and blabla. 

I had my limit and said, ""If you keep pushing me, it won't just be your mother who won't be on my labor. So either stop or you won't come in."" 

He started to say that I was crossing lines and that he had a right to have this moment. I was taking this with  them too far. 

He slept on the couch and doesn't talk to me more than necessary. 

AITA?

Well, many are saying it's just a gender reveal. I honestly don't care for that and I think it's tacky, but my mom was the type who like/love it and she always dreamed of having grandchildren, she said she was made to be a grandmother. She can't meet my son or even know I'm pregnant, so I wanted to do something tacky that I don't care for her, not for me. Everyone knew the importance and the reason. I always wanted to have a gender reveal with my mom there  and I didn't have either.

Extra:

Let's go to some points:

 - At no time did I say that I would never approach them again. But RIGHT NOW, I don't see myself doing that. I already have grief, pregnancy hormones, and day-to-day stress to deal with so I don't want anything else to bother me. 

- Obviously I want my husband to be in childbirth. But it's a lot of stress, he brings this topic all the time and I doubt he'll stop even at the time of my delivery trying to convince me. Even if he goes, if he says anything about his mother coming, I'll ask him to leave.","AmItheAsshole",16914,16914,0,0.94,15,0,5,2941

**Original Post:**
I (24f) gave birth to my daughter six months ago and it should've been the happiest moment in my life. When my daughter was born her skin was very dark and looked like she could have two biological parents who were of African descendent. My husband Jim (26m), fake name, was furious and accused me of cheating and left right then and there. He told everyone on both sides of the family what happened, made posts on social media and wanted a divorce. His family and a lot of our friend all called to say how upset they were at me and called me really nasty names. My mother was by my side the entire time and I kept professing my innocence. Jim refused to pick me up from the hospital, threw my stuff out on the lawn and changed the locks, so I had to stay with my parents. When my sister called to ask for the baby stuff Jim texted me pictures of the bare nursery room and said he got rid of everything. He even destroyed my Art studio, I like to paint, and the art I made and told me my work would be too awful to sell. I was distraught and tried to focus on my baby.

Weeks went by and Jim refused to speak to me directly and has never once asked about our child. Eventually he agreed to do a paternity and he was 100% the father. No one could believe the results and it was done again, Jim's the dad. Around that same time one of Jim's cousins did the Ancestry thing and there was around 30% of African ancestry in the family. This combined with the test Jim paternal great-grandmother admitted to having an affair around the time Jim's grandfather was born and was because he could pass she just assumed her husband was the father.

Since then Jim has been reaching out and everyone has come to apologize, and while it did feel good to feel vindicated the damage has been done. I can't un-hear or unsee all the horrible things that was said and done. Not just to me but to my child as well. Jim made some very racist remarks. Things that I thought he'd never say and he did it so easily. Regardless of what our daughter looks like I don't want her to be around that. What else will Jim and his family say or do the next time they get mad? How are they going to treat our daughter when she does something that upsets them?

Jim has been begging for forgiveness. I said I needed time, he asked to see the baby and I let him but I'm too afraid to physically hand her to him. He's repairing the the nursery and keeps asking me what I would like and I cry every time saying we already had what I liked and some of the items that we had can't be replaced. He asked me if I still loved him and I admitted that he showed me his worst self and I don't know if I could live with that image. I didn't mean to be hurtful but it's how I feel. My sister suggested Couple's Therapy but I don't feel like I should have to work to fix something that I didn't break. I've never cheated and have been 100% innocent in all of this the whole. AITA for not wanting to give Jim a second chance?

**Update 1:** 
I stepped away for a few hours and couldn't believe what I came back to. I am truly amazed by all the wonderful comments of support as well as the private messages. I also understand why some people may think this is fake and all I can say is that you are free to believe what you want in this. I also see some questions and I think I should clarify a few things just in case your judgement may change.

All of this initially happened at the near February and I was already settled at my parents' house before the pandemic hit.
One of the reasons Jim wouldn't pick me up from the hospital was because I wouldn't admit to cheating or give him any details, because there weren't any which made him angrier.

Based on the pictures Jim sent me he didn't take a sledgehammer to the crib or anything. He just took stuff down to either return it for the money or gave it away. While deeply hurtful I wouldn't call it violent, but maybe it is.

Online he announced that I ""pushed out a dark skinned baby"" and was going to he was divorce me. His family started with the racial comments and eventually he started doing it too but only through my family, he refused to speak to me directly.
Once the truth came out everything he and his family posts were all taken down but I, and a few friends, still have the screenshots. Jim never wrote down his racial remarks.

While he didn't say any of the racist words he did make comments about our daughter being a ""Welfare Princess,"" and how I was going to be just another ""baby mama.""

Just to clarify. Jim is ""white"" and I am at least half white. One of my parents is adopted and with everything that's happened they decided to do the Ancestry thing too and we should be getting the results any day now.

**Update 2:** Spelling Errors

**Update 3:**
Mod denied separate post so it's here as an edit.

Thank you so for all your words of encouragement a couple months back, both in posts and the DMs. A lot of things have happened since my initial post and I just needed time to process it and be in a place where I can write about on social media. So here it goes....

First, my parent who was adopted did the Ancestry/23 thing and it turns out that Jim wasn't the only one who had African ancestry. My parent had at least 45%, which means I have at least 20%. I am legally separated from my husband with primary custody, and I'm living with my parents until further notice. He still keeps apologizing and wants me to come back to the house, he even offered to leave so I could stay with our daughter but I don't want to and really like having the support of my parents. My dad is retired so he does a lot of the babysitting while my mother and I work remotely.

I do go to the house every so often so Jim can see his daughter and for Couple's Counseling via telecom. In one of the sessions Jim confessed something really hurtful and some of you guessed right, he cheated. It was while we were dating, before he proposed, and his treatment towards me was a projection. It was with an ex-girlfriend who had cheated on him and he hooked up with her as an ego boost. He started to feel guilty but was too scared that I would walk away to ever confess. Jim also admitted that he was scared when I got pregnant (our baby wasn't planned), was very anxious about being a father, but just pretended to be excited because he didn't want to look like an A. My husband was so willing to believe that our daughter wasn't his because he thought he had an out. Now that he knows that our child is his and has spent time with her Jim regrets everything and just wants his family back and is willing to spend the rest of his life making it up to us.

This was all deeply hurtful and I've cried about it more than once. Jim has been lying to me and my ability to trust him hasn't improved at all. When the holidays came around Jim's parents asked about seeing their grandchild and I didn't want to. They told me that it was selfish of me to keep her away and I reminded them of their past. They said that they've already apologized and tried to minimize the situation. They said that I can't be angry forever and that I need to learn to forgive them. I'm so ashamed of ever loving and marrying into this family and wonder why I didn't see this before. I've decided to contact a lawyer and will be filing for divorce after my daughter's first Birthday.","BestofRedditorUpdates",15425,15425,0,0.96,2,0,1,1101

Amanda has lived on her own since college, but still is in the general area. Currently Amanda and Chris arent that focused on their future, mostly on having fun and doing things while theyre still young. Theres nothing wrong with that, in my opinion, and I think that young people should have that kind of period in their life, especially after the pandemic.

I got a call from Amanda. She and Chris told me how they have taken several tests and confirmed that Amanda is pregnant! They would be hosting an announcement dinner, but wanted immediate family to know right away. They could barely wait as they had been trying since they were married. **(Note that this was an intended pregnancy)** I told them I was thrilled to be a grandpa. 

The dinner party happened last week and the announcement was met with only happiness and excitement. Chris and Amanda were talking to a friend and Chris made a comment along the lines of Good thing that Bobby (me) will while were at work! I was confused and asked what they were talking about. Amanda revealed that she and Chris were expecting me to always watch the baby while they were working and so they could have fun time while not working.

Now I love my children and will never regret being their dad. But I didnt sign up for a new baby. Im done with all that. I want to enjoy my retirement and be free without any underage children. I explained this to Amanda and Chris, also that there are many great daycare options in the area.

Amanda began to cause a scene because You told me you were thrilled to be a grandpa! I responded that exactly, I was thrilled to be a **grandpa**, not a parent to this baby. She said that I should help out since I dont have to worry about working (I receive a pension) and that shes young and these are supposed to be the best years of her life, and she thinks it's unfair that she and Chriss life should be all about a baby.

I was very frank and responded that Amanda, of course, you and Chriss life is going to be all about a baby. Thats what it means to be a parent. You should not have gotten pregnant if you just expected someone else to raise **your** child. Amanda yelled at me Dont be surprised when I put you in a shitty nursing home

My son, Michael, says that I was harsh in my delivery by not my message. My son, Nathan, agreed that Amanda and Chris are expecting too much and it was irresponsible to purposely get pregnant when they believe they dont have time to raise a baby. My sister, Sandra, however, told me my comment was callous and misogynistic and I havent raised a newborn in twenty years and dont realize how much harder being a parent has gotten. And I can agree to start providing at least four days of childcare per week then go from there. Multiple family members are agreeing with Sandra, so Im looking for some unbiased perspectives on here. AITA?","AmItheAsshole",15070,15070,0,0.97,12,0,1,2289

[**ORIGINAL POST**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/btred7/aita_for_raining_on_my_cousins_parade_regarding/) from /r/AmITheAsshole, posted May 27, 2019 by /u/LightningStr

My cousin Stephanie and I are really more friends than relatives. An important note is that she's not really online much, so can be out of the loop on certain memes and jokes in internet culture, and tbh, doesn't really understand the concept of viral internet references or how they work.

Stephanie is pregnant and just found out it's going to be a girl. About a week ago, she told a gathering of her best girlfriends that she's going to name her daughter Karen. The room instantly went cold, but after an awkward silence, everyone else politely said it was lovely. I couldn't bring myself to respond at all. Later in the evening, when Stephanie was out of the room, everyone was immediately like, ""OMG, that poor kid,"" and ""why would she pick Karen of all names?!"" I was uncomfortable with this conversation, given that everyone had been so positive about the name to her face.

I thought more about it over the next couple of days, and just felt really weird about the whole thing. The name is really loaded, to the point it could be detrimental to the baby, and Stephanie had no idea of the connotations to make an informed decision.

So a couple of days later, I tentatively brought it up. I told her I was so excited for the baby, and just wanted her to have all available information when picking a name. I then started to explain that Karen has some negative connotations and has become sort of an internet joke to describe a specific kind of entitled middle aged woman. Stephanie instantly was furious and started talking over me, saying, ""why are you saying this?! This is so mean!!"" I was really surprised by her reaction (it felt very, very out of character), so I immediately stopped and said, ""I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I just wanted to tell you something I thought you might not know.""

She replied, ""That's the name I picked for my daughter. And you think I picked it as some kind of joke?! I don't understand why you'd say something so hurtful."" When she said that, I felt like it signaled that she didn't really understand what I was trying to tell her, so after agonizing for a second about whether to press the issue even though she was so angry, I felt like in for a penny, in for a pound, and since she was already mad, I wanted her to at least understand what I was trying to explain to her. I googled ""Karen know your meme"" on my phone and tried to show her the screen of results while saying, ""look, I'm just saying that there's more meaning to the name than you may realize.""

She stood up, pushed my phone away, and shouted, ""Wow!!"" She then stormed out of my home and drove away. My aunt and mom have been berating me all week, because Stephanie told them that I made fun of her baby name. Stephanie has not spoken to me or responded to my texts since.

I can take a hint, and I'm not going to broach a topic again that caused so much distress, but I keep going back and forth on whether I was TA here by bringing it up in the first place.

*Note: In the original post, OOP was overwhelmingly given a YTA judgment in response to this post.*

Edit: Thanks, everyone! I have been properly schooled, and I accept my judgement that I was TA here. Stephanie and I have a history of being extremely open and honest with each other (I was the maid of honor in her wedding, which we planned on being the case from a young age, and we always joked as teenagers that part of my duties would include talking her out of the marriage if the groom she picked sucked), and so maybe I was too flippant with approaching this topic due to our history, and was unempathetic in underestimating how much she was already invested in the name she chose for her future daughter. I admit I'm a bit frustrated that Stephanie still doesn't understand what I was trying to tell her (she *still* thinks I was making some kind of weird, cruel joke accusing *her* of picking the name as a joke), but I have messaged her a sincere apology that she accepted, and I will never speak of this again, to Stephanie or Baby Karen. I'll also stand up for Stephanie if her other friends shit talk the name around me again. If they're not willing to voice their thoughts to Stephanie directly, they need to not say the kinds of things they were saying behind her back.

Edit 2: One more thing: I definitely was not trying to tell Stephanie to not name her daughter Karen. I just wanted her to make the decision either way knowing the connotations, since I'd want someone to do the same for me if I picked a baby name with cultural baggage I wasn't aware of. I realize now I handled it poorly and was hurtful to Stephanie in the process, but I just wanted to be clear that I wasn't actively trying to talk her out of the name. I just didn't want her to be blindsided if it came up later.

**Additional context from OOP's comments:**

Stephanie and her husband have a deal on baby names where she picks girl baby names, he picks boy baby names, and they each have unlimited veto power for the other person's choices. He's on board with Karen AFAIK. We're all the same age (late 20s) but neither of them spends time online or is even particularly tech savvy.

**[UPDATE one year later](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ha6c24/update_aita_for_raining_on_my_cousins_parade/)** (posted June 16, 2020) 

My post last summer wasn't the most exciting or dramatic on AITA, but I wanted to provide an update if anyone is interested.

Baby Karen was born healthy and happy back in October. She's an absolute sweetheart of a baby, and I'm totally in love with her. Between March and May, I didn't get to see her at all in person, but I was doing regular FaceTime/House Party calls with Stephanie and Karen, and over the last few weeks, I've been going over to Stephanie's house to sit in her backyard and chat with Stephanie/coo at Karen from a lengthy distance.

I have two reasons for updating. First, I've realized since Karen's birth that her name has taken on new meaning to me. When I'm with her, Karen just means her, and I don't think about the other connotations. In other words, you guys were right!

That said, though, my second reason for updating is that Stephanie got back into her years-unused Facebook at the beginning of the pandemic to keep in touch with people. She's been on it pretty regularly lately for the first time in years (historically, she's not really been into social media). Most people in our area/social circle have been posting really heavily about BLM and the protests happening right now, as well as racial justice issues more generally. As a result, Stephanie has now come into contact with a deluge of Karen memes for the first time, and found them confusing and horrifying, especially the use of ""Karen"" as shorthand for a racist. I've basically just declined to talk about it with Stephanie, because it went so poorly last time, but both my mother and her mother have hounded me about it because it's upsetting to Stephanie, and said things like, ""Is this what you were talking about before? Why didn't you say so? Why didn't you explain it better?! You should have told Stephanie!!""

And Jesus wept!! You really can't win.

Thanks again for all your feedback on my last post! It was very helpful in giving me some Zen about the situation.

Edit: Wow, I've been super overwhelmed by the flood of very kind, heartfelt PMs (and just one or two not so kind ones) as well as the comments on my other post. Thank you, everyone! It continually amazes me how many nice and empathetic people frequent a sub devoted to assholes.

**Additional comments from OOP for context:**

*In response to someone criticizing Stephanie:*

To be fair, Stephanie has been cool about it. First, she saw a bunch of posts about ""the Central Park Karen"" when that white lady was harassing the black birdwatcher in the park, and came to me asking me to explain why everyone was calling the woman Karen when her name was Amy. (Since she's gotten back on Facebook, she often asks me to be like her internet culture ""interpreter.""). I immediately told her, ""Sorry, I'm not having a conversation with you about this, because we had a major conflict over it last year, and I'm not getting into it with you."" I think that was the first time she started to understand what I'd been telling her last year. And in fairness to her, she didn't bring it up with me again after that.

As for my mom and aunt, they're kind of generally ridiculous. They tend to be extremely reactive to whatever is going on precisely at that moment, and if someone in the family is upset, they get overinvolved trying to ""fix"" it. Stephanie has been venting to her mom about this (not about me, just how upsetting the memes are), and she and my mom have just been doing their normal thing of blowing it out of proportion, and now making it my fault somehow. I love my mom and aunt dearly, but they're not to be reasoned with.

*In response to another criticism of Stephanie:*

Honestly, with my mom and aunt, it's easier to just wait for them to move on to the next shiny thing. =

I don't blame Stephanie at all. She's just upset and confused, but hasn't made it my problem at all. My aunt and mom just have a flair for the dramatic.

*In response to someone saying they still thought OOP was TA because they only brought up concerns with the name for selfish reasons:*

I probably wasn't clear about this in my original post, and I think it's probably because that's the part I cut down when I went way over the word limit on that first post, but when I described feeling weird and uncomfortable over the couple of days I took to ruminate after Stephanie's announcement, the weirdness and discomfort was mostly a response to what happened with our friend group rather than just my own feelings about the name. I felt super uncomfortable being in the room while our friends shit-talked Stephanie's name choice after praising it to her face. I didn't have the presence of mind in the moment to call them out before the moment was passed, and I sat with that guilt for a couple of days. I didn't want to tell Stephanie what they said, because it would be tattle-y of me, and I also didn't want to cause conflict within the friend group or upset Stephanie. So raising the topic on my own seemed like a good compromise at the time. I did wrestle internally with how to handle it, and clearly I missed the mark.

*In response to the comment: ""Do you understand that there is a massive difference in being upset with your friends for their response, and approaching Stephanie because you say you want her to be fully informed of her name choice? These are two different things that you're conflating."":*

No, to be clear, I didn't raise the conversation with Stephanie in lieu of scolding our friends; I brought it up because I thought they owed it to her to raise those points to her face if they were going to say them at all. Ultimately, I thought Stephanie was owed the knowledge of those connotations, whatever she chose to do with that knowledge.

Also, I don't know how to explain the context of our relationship, but Stephanie and I have a lifetime of shared radical honesty with one another, from the inconsequential (telling each other when outfits are unflattering) to the difficult (when she gave me a come-to-Jesus talk years ago about how someone I considered a close friend was super shitty to me and that I should end the friendship). Based on our extreme closeness and shared history, this conversation felt like the right move at the time, even though it ultimately backfired.

[**UPDATE two years on**](https://www.reddit.com/user/LightningStr/comments/y3zmrx/update_on_baby_karen_if_anyone_is_still_following/) (posted October 14, 2022)

Hi all, I've gotten a few PMs over the last couple years asking for updates, and since we just celebrated Karen's third birthday, I wanted to circle back to anyone following this story.

First of all, Baby Karen (not so much a baby anymore!) is doing amazingly on her developmental milestones! She's a very bright child, sharp as the sharpest tack, and extremely tuned into her environment. Some of what she says is already *fully in complete sentences*, which just makes me want to cry when I hear it, because it seems like Stephanie was giving birth just yesterday. Karen loves books already, and will intently study the pictures in them for huge stretches of time and claim to be ""reading."" And you would not believe the uncomfortably incisive questions she's already asking. I am fully convinced this child is going to grow up to be an actual genius.

Regarding the name: unfortunately, when Karen started daycare earlier this year, she started getting grief for her name pretty quickly from the older kids. The daycare she attends mixes the ages together at a couple of different points throughout the day, and while there fortunately wasn't much direct bullying, two of the age-5s must have heard and internalized the derogatory connotations of the name Karen at home. As a result, they found her name absolutely hysterical, and they kind of spread the idea to the other kids that there was something funny/wrong about her name. Karen was too little to understand what was happening, but found the other kids' behavior toward her generally upsetting. The daycare staff made every effort to shut it down, and let Stephanie and her husband know right away. After about a month of this, where the daycare wasn't having much success putting the kibosh on this behavior, and the kids weren't dropping it, Stephanie and her husband made the decision that Karen would be going by ""Karrie"" from now on, which was already an established nickname that a lot of family and friends were already using, and that Karen already recognized as referring to herself.

Stephanie and I never really fully revisited what happened during her pregnancy, but when she was telling me about what was happening in daycare, she apologized to me. I immediately felt terrible and reassured her there was no reason to apologize, emotions are complicated when you're pregnant, and that I thought having Karen go by Karrie was a great solution. (Though changing what you're used to calling someone is fucking *hard*, I've found, and I'm still directly addressing her on manual mode, every single time.)

A lot of the responses I got to my last post were gleeful and leaned into the schadenfreude of the situation, and I have to say those responses really bummed me out. I would much, much rather live in a world where I was wrong about the impact Karen's name would have on her. I cannot emphasize enough what a sweet-dispositioned, smart, curious, loving little girl Karrie is, and how much she deserves every good thing in life. 

Also: a lot of people didn't like Stephanie in my last post, but I need you to understand that this is a tiny snapshot of a very emotionally high-strung time in her life, and overall, Stephanie is a wonderful lifelong friend. She has gotten me through so many personal crises over the years, and she will never fail to show up for the people she cares about. Being pregnant and having a strong emotional attachment to the name you've picked out for your daughter is completely understandable, and her pregnancy was pretty rough on her moods. (She once wept uncontrollably at a cat food commercial when she was about seven months pregnant.) I also think my approach for trying to explain the name issue those years ago was very clumsy, and I could have done a better job of bringing it up. That said, with the distance of time, I am really glad I did broach the topic. I feel like I owed Stephanie that information, and I can feel good about giving it to her. If I'd chosen not to bring it up at the time, I think I'd have a lot of regrets now. The only thing I'd change now, looking back, is that I would try to bring it up more gently somehow with Stephanie so I could have had the chance to explain.

In summary: all is well! We've run into a little bump in the road with other kids' reactions to Karrie's name, but in some ways, it's better to get this out of the way now, when Karrie doesn't really understand what's happening, than have this happen in kindergarten or elementary school down the road, when full-on bullying could be a risk. She's adjusting really well to going by her nickname full-time, and Stephanie and her husband are planning on enrolling her with ""Karrie"" as her preferred name in all future schooling. And since schools around here go by preferred name rather than legal name in things like classroom roll-calls, it's possible she can get through K-12 without it ever really being widely known among her peers that her legal name is Karen. (And I really hope this common usage of the name Karen dies down in the next few years!)

[**A comment defending Stephanie in response to someone commenting that she's a bad friend to OOP**:](https://www.reddit.com/user/LightningStr/comments/y3zmrx/update_on_baby_karen_if_anyone_is_still_following/itv2780/)

Stephanie is genuinely a great friend and a good person! She once dropped everything and drove 300 miles because I had just been in a (relatively minor) car accident in a city I lived all alone in as a young adult. She once gifted me $1500, no questions asked, and insisted I never even think about paying it back, when I needed to get out of a really bad cohabiting situation while broke. When we were teenagers and the cool boy she had a massive crush on made fun of me for something I was extremely sensitive about, instead of keeping quiet, she blew her top, stuck up for me and told him off, then led me away to comfort me away from him. She is loyal and kind and has incredible character. This post is such a tiny, tiny snapshot of who she is as a person.

When I raised my concerns, Stephanie was emotional, very pregnant, and somewhat sleep deprived. Her pregnancy was rough on her body, and on top of hormones, I think she was just genuinely confused by what I was trying to tell her.","BestofRedditorUpdates",14789,14789,0,0.93,2,0,1,2277

I (23F) and my husband (24M) just had our first baby. My husband was so excited and was super supportive and caring throughout the pregnancy. The only this is that he became slightly obsessed with watching YouTube and TikTok videos of husbands pulling pranks on their wives while in labor. I didnt mind at first but then he started casually joking about doing things he saw in the videos saying it would be funny. I clearly stated my distaste for them and asked him not to do anything like what he saw. He agreed and continued to joke about it time to time but I brushed it off since I trusted him and thought nothing would come of it.
The day of the delivery came and I had been in labor for 8 hrs (12 hr total labor). I had just finished another round of contractions when my husband let out the loudest fart, turned to me and said, what the hell have you been eating OP? It smells disgusting I immediately recognized that as one of the pranks in the videos. Outraged at him not honoring what I asked him not to do I demanded that he leave the room. He started yo arguing saying it was just a joke but I insisted and luckily the nurse helped get him out. I went through the last 4 hrs of labor by myself since my family lives out of state and Im not close to my MIL. After the delivery I told the nurse he could come back into the room and he was fuming. He started demanding that I tell him why I kicked him out. I calmly told him the reason but he was pissed. He hasnt talked to me in a week. His mom is taking his side saying that I was a complete bitch for kicking him out. Normally he will defend me from her but this time he completely agreed. 
I might be the asshole because I know how much he was looking forward to being there for the birth of our first kid and especially when he got to cut the cord, but I still kicked him out and refused to let him back in. The nursed asked a few times if I wanted him back but each time I said no. AITA for kicking out my husband after a stupid prank he agreed not to do?

Edit: I just wanted to thank everyone for all the support and reassurance on here and wanted to answer some questions and give an update
QUESTIONS: he has been bonding with the baby but not quite helping. When he felt like holding her he would just take her from my arms or if MIL was around he would ask her to get the baby. And I know I posted this answer previously but I wanted to put it here in case anyone missed it. If he had been apologetic in anyway I would have let him come back into the delivery room. And the nurse check on him but he was sulking and complaining that I did that. 

*UPDATE:*

Its been a rough first week but thankfully my mother arrived this morning to help out. I talked to my husband (as best I could since he is still upset and ignoring me) and told him how I was feeling (I have been feeling depressed and anxious since we brought the baby home) and that I understood why he was upset but asked him to please see my side. He told me that I had no right to kick him out and that our daughter would come to hate me one day for having him miss her birth. I started crying and begged him to please talk things through instead of saying things out of anger. He refused and said I was under his roof so he had the final say and called me a c*** for kicking him out of the delivery room. I didnt say anything else to him I just started packing myself and the babys things and planned on leaving. He yelled telling me that I couldnt take anything he paid for (I havent worked since the start of the pandemic) I just took the baby and told my mom we were leaving. We are staying at a motel and will drive to my parents house tomorrow. Sorry for the long update but I wanted everyone to know the outcome!

[**AITA for shutting off the movie half way through and making my boyfriend feel bad?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ok8d1a/aita_for_shutting_off_the_movie_half_way_through/) - 14 July 2021

My boyfriend (Wyatt) and I always watch movies together every time we have off days that end up on the same day. Especially since the pandemic. And we go back and forth on who picks the movie. But I've noticed he's usually talking through my movie choices. Either pointing out 'plot holes' or just talking down about the movie in one way or another.

I never act this way when it's his turn to pick the movie. Even if I don't care for it. Like the last movie he chose, The Fountain. I was so confused until half way through and then bored the rest of the film. But I didn't talk during the movie or constantly dump on it either. And even at the end when he asked what I thought I said it was alright, even though I thought the movie wasn't good. It tried to do a bunch of different things all at once and ended up doing nothing. But he seemed really fond of it so I didn't want to hurt his feelings.

But he doesn't seem to have that mindset when it comes to him watching my picks. I've told him to shush and to just watch the movies but he just sighs loudly and says they're boring. If I tell him to stop he gets all huffy and goes totally silent and usually takes his phone out to play a game or scroll the internet, totally ignoring me and the movie. It really hurts my feelings.

And yesterday was my turn to choose again, and I picked a good movie that really hit me hard as a kid (I bawled when I first watched it and still tear up to this day). And I told him this movie was special to me but he barely got 10 minutes into it before he started up saying it was boring and childish. It is a kids movie but that doesn't make it boring. I was getting upset and before the big part of the movie even got close I just couldn't take it anymore. I felt like him acting this way during a super important part would ruin the movie for me, maybe forever, so I just got up and turned it off.

He asked what I was doing and I told him I didn't want to have the movie ruined for me so it was better if I just turn it off. He said I was being a baby and to turn it back on. I refused and just told him to pick something to watch instead, then I sat on the couch. He got mad and said if I was gonna be dramatic like this then he didn't want to watch anything with me and got up and went to his room and slammed the door.

This happened the other day and he's been giving me the cold shoulder and when I asked why he said he wants an apology for making him feel like dirt. Should I apologize? Did I really make a huge deal out of just a movie? AITA?

Verdict: NTA

I've gotten a LOT of comments and IMs asking what the movie I chose was. It was The Bridge to Terabithia. It's not the best movie ever but it was the first 'kids' movie I watched when I was young that really moved me and made me cry.

/

Uh hey. Final(?) edit. I ended up having to call my parents who called the cops on Wyatt.

I read all the advice from everyone saying he wasn't respecting my interests or me as a person and it got me thinking and stuff I ignored or overlooks before started popping out to me. Stuff that didn't seem fair to me that I'd just put up with because I loved him. And so many people told me to just break up with him and I could do better. But I was in love and he was my first serious boyfriend, and I really just wanted to work things out and get through this thing with him.

So I tried to sit down and have a serious talk with him, just hoping he'd listen this time. I told him how he acted made me feel and his behavior during my movie choices ruined the experience for me. And I told him I never act that way during his movies because I know he likes them and I respect him and don't want to be mean or belittle his interests, even if they don't interest me. About then he told me I was being dramatic again and they were just stupid movies and he tried excusing his behavior by saying my movie choices suck anyways.

I was just so tired by this point and wanted some space and quiet to think about where we go from here. So I started to ask him to go back to his apartment for the night but he interrupted me by yelling how since I couldn't have my way I was kicking him out. It really scared me because he'd never screamed at me before, even when he'd raise his voice during arguments he never full on screamed at me. I tried to get him to calm down but he started calling me a bunch of nasty stuff and even backed me up against a wall and grabbed my bicep hard enough to bruise I saw later, I panicked and ran to the bathroom and locked it behind me.

He banged on the door, telling me to come out and I was crying and couldn't think of anything else to do but call my parents. Mom answered and she could hear him screaming and the banging in the background. Her and dad were freaked out and dad called the cops. Long story short the cops and my folks showed up and Wyatt was removed from my apartment and my parents told him not to come back or we'd get a restraining order.

It's almost 10:30pm now and I've locked my apartment up and am currently staying with my mom and dad for a while. Thanks for the advice everyone. But Wyatt and I are pretty much over and I think I'm done with this account and I'll be logging off now.

And yes, I meant Apex Clearinghouse, not Robinhood you twits, Apex made RH do it, and a dozen other brokers as well. Vlad was just a fall guy, and not the cool kind that was on TV back in the '80s.

What the LME did can be split into two parts:

1. they had a massive short squeeze that was fucking up prices, amplified by uncertainty from the war in Ukraine, so they completely halted trading. This is entirely normal. It's happened dozens of times in the 144 years they've been open. Complete trading halts occur in all exchanges whenever shit starts getting fucked up. For example, US markets were shut down for a week after 9/11.
2. they fucking canceled 12 hours worth of completed trades. This is the part that should get your knickers in a twist if you were actually wearing any.

Now, I know a lot of you are sitting there feeling smart thinking ""I know why they did it! They're criminals and stealing!"" Well, you're right, but that's NOT why they canceled 12 hours of completed trades, just like Apex didn't turn off the meme buy button because they woke up and decided they really needed to use their broker apps to get their fuck on with retail in a big 'ol gang bang.

No, they did this for one reason and one reason only: survival. They were dead. LME let the Nickel market get so fucked up that they not only had to stop transactions, or unwind a couple at the end, they had to unwind 12 fucking hours worth of trading. I mean, these people are so goddamned incompetent that they didn't even realize they'd been shot in the head, skinned, and turned into a fucking rug for two whole shifts at Wendy's!

Understand, they just set 144 years of skimming trades on fire. It's not little guys buying FDs on the LME, it's big boys and industrial giants. They all have lawyers and elected officials on retainer, and all of those clients are as done and gone as your made up Canadian girlfriend from grade school.

I can't decide if the best part of all this is the cover story they put out, or how many dumbfucks didn't take three seconds to realize its bullshit. The idea that Xiang Guangda just said ""I don't want to pay the margin call"" and then the LME was like, ""ok, well, I guess that sucks to be us, guess we'll just pour all this gasoline on ourselves and play with matches"" is so laughable I just got a hernia from ROFLing so hard. Look, because I know you 'tards are all stuck on the shortbus trying to figure out what I'm talking about, I'll just drive ya'll on over to the explanation:

Tsingshan (the company Xiang owns that has the short position) isn't some kind of nickel producer like the papers are saying. They make steel. They're the second largest (largest by revenue) steel making company in China. You know what that steel is used for? Construction. Know who hasn't had enough money to make a bond payment in over six months now? Every goddamned construction company and developer in China. What, you think they're paying their fucking materials bills?

Here's a quote from the South China Morning Post attributed to Xiang:

*Foreigners have some activities going on \[against Tsingshans position,\] we are actively coordinating \[to tackle the problem\], China Business News cited Xiang as saying in a report late on Tuesday. We have received a lot of phone calls today  related government departments and leaders are very supportive to us. Tsingshans position, operation and management has no problems.*

Again, because I know you can't read, here's a translation of that quote into a picture.

&amp;#x200B;

I specifically said there are no problems, so it's all okay!

Now, why is it such a huge problem that Xiang has no money? Well, if he can't make the margin call, the short position, much like a politician or anyone who's daddy donated a library to get them into Harvard, fails upwards. First it goes up to Xiang's bank, which is also fucking broke. Then it moves onto the LME itself, which again, doesn't have the fucking money. So what does the LME do? Same thing the mobsters in Goodfellas did when the restaurant was too broke to steal from anymore, they set everything on fire. The reason the LME hasn't opened back up yet is because the short position is still there, and nobody who's responsible for that position has the money to cover it.

Now, you might think, if you were smart instead of so dumb you went to Bangkok to get a TIE Fighter, why does this Xiang guy have such a large naked short position he can't cover? The answer is simplicity itself - he's broke, so he naked shorted his own shit to get paid, then got fucked when it went sideways. I mean, people here on reddit like to call themselves reckless degenerates, but lemme give you a full ""trust me bro"" on this one, ya'll ain't got shit on the stupid rich fucks that run the world.

That's part one. What about part 2, RSX? Well, as many people who lost money Friday can attest, some serious, serious fucking of Put options occurred. Van Eck started to liquidate the RSX fund, but they didn't *say* they were liquidating it, so options couldn't settle as cash value. But they ALSO halted trading of the ETF, so options couldn't be traded either. And as a final piece of fuck you brokers weren't letting people borrow shares to even fucking exercise the put option themselves. Wild yeah? (someone else wrote a very good DD on this exact thing this morning, I highly recommend you go read it - no link because automod hates me every time I put a link in my posts)

This is example number two of someone burning down the restaurant because they couldn't steal from it anymore. Whatever MM sold those options didn't have enough to cover them, so this shit with Van Eck not stating the fund was liquidating happened.

That's strike two for all the market makers and exchanges being fucking broker than you when you've gotta go behind the Taco Bell because Wendy's is too high class for your ass. Let's see if we can a third K to finish them off.

I give you Rivian, ticker RIVN, a truly shitty EV manufacturer, that like most of them can't actually make cars. These guys are such a clown show that they tried to raise the prices on the pre-orders from the people who waited years to get one. So they had earnings on 3/10, and it was just about as big of a disaster as you'd expect. Then, after hours, they dropped $6 bucks on nearly a million in volume. Everyone who bought puts printed, right? Nope. The next day in pre-market, on less than a third of that volume, the price magically shot back up $5.5 bucks, completely wiping out everyone's puts. By EOD the price had only dropped a total of $3 bucks from Thursday's close, and wouldn't you know it, the price of an ATM put option bought EOD on 3/10 was more than $3. I'd recommend taking a look at the volume numbers and corresponding price movement of RIVN throughout the day on 3/11 and drawing your own conclusions.

This is like the, what, hundredth and a half time we've seen this exact thing play out now? It's not an accident. More money is traded every day in the market on options than stocks themselves. When the PFOF brokers that retail uses publicly refer to the MMs as ""our clients"", you know the fix is in. What makes the RIVN bit so interesting is a) how obvious it is, and b) that they're doing this while under DOJ investigation for this exact fucking thing. That tells me two things, 1) they don't think they'll actually be prosecuted - which, fair, they've got a whole lot of history on their side for this one, and 2) they don't have a choice 'cause they're running out of money.

And why, you may ask are they out of money? Well, it's a mix of things. 1) all the attention from Reddit and the media and law enforcement has clients pulling money from Hedge Funds, leading to sell offs, which when you're leveraged at 137x, leads to a rapid collapse in your buying power. 2) Russian assets aren't just in freefall anymore, they've hit the ground and started drilling for oil. 3) remember where I was talking about China earlier? Yeah, their shit is worth even less than the Russian stuff, but thanks to Xi's brilliant leadership plan, people haven't realized that yet. Below, I have obtained exclusive photo evidence from some of my old SF buddies of Xi and his top councilor enacting their plan to save China's economy.

If we can't see the lines go down, then are they really dropping?

As always, the official info coming out of China is a mix of fantasy, lies, and flat out ignorance, spiced up by a heaping helping of corrupt incompetence. Because Xi is a tinpot wannabe dictator with delusions of Imperial grandeur, he wanted to make sure that while he was hosting the Olympics everything went off without a hitch, so he told all the companies and rich people in China to make like autists and buy the fucking dip in the equities and bond markets.

Because all those folks didn't want to get executed by anti-aircraft guns while their families went to the organ donor farms, they did. Which in this case, means throwing good money after very very very bad money. It's honestly difficult to describe just how badly China has sabotaged itself. I'm sure you all know by now about the ghost cities made up of structurally unsound buildings with no interiors, and in some cases no exterior walls. But, do you also know about all the railways to nowhere that aren't being serviced or maintained? Do you also know how many MORE shitty tofu-dreg buildings have been paid for by citizens' life savings that aren't yet built? Spoiler, it's a lot.

Meanwhile, the property market in China is in free fall. Here's a chart of official chinese statistics on the price of housing.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/es47b4lw31n81.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=cc53d7f332b427a0c9bf5390cd6703a049d7fe23

Taken directly from the National Bureau of Statistics of China

Now, these prices all reflect worthless tofu-dreg empty apartments that exist only to sell to the next sucker/investor. Notice that trend line? Anyone know what happens when that price increase gets closer to zero? As our friend Lelu from the 5th Element would say ""Big bada boom!"". For another reference, look at the Dutch tulip market after it popped. Remember, these are the official Chinese govt numbers. I'm guessing the actual numbers have gone negative already.

Western banks, particularly up in Canada, are extremely exposed to the bonds these empty shell apartments are backing. Western banks, again particularly up in Canada, are also heavily exposed to the commercial and residential real estate markets. Both of which are in massive fucking bubbles funded in large part by money from Wall Street, Russia, and China. Guess which of those are now broke (hint: it's all three of them). CMBS notes started going bad this month - there's a reason all the politicians all of a sudden decided we needed to be back in the office, and the mortgage missed payment rate is skyrocketing faster than the price of oil. I have not yet been able to figure out if the spike in missed mortgage payments is banks/wall street failing to pay on all the properties they've accumulated, if it's all the missing repossessions from the pandemic finally showing up, or if it's a leading indicator of a new crisis.

I don't know how much longer the powers-that-be can keep these balls in the air, but it's not much longer. Assuming Russia follows their playbook from the disaster they had in Grozny in '94/'95, we're about to see the major cities in Ukraine get leveled by heavy artillery and rocket attacks. Which means you can pretty much kiss the Ukrainian wheat harvest goodbye, because all the infrastructure needed to support it will be rubble, along with the roads and bridges you'd need to get it out of the country. Couple that with what looks to be bad wheat harvests in the US and China barring some big weather pattern shifts, and we're going to see some massive price spikes in the price of bread and other food this summer. Expensive food = political instability and riots.

The US will see a fresh round of ""race riots"" sparked by random online videos that are really about inflation and economic inequality, but the media and politicians will go full hog on the race angle, and people will buy it - if you need proof the general population is that gullible, look at how many think the Ukraine war is responsible for inflation and gas prices. South Africa and Turkey, plus an unknown number of Middle Eastern countries will see Syrian civil war/Arab Spring type uprisings - remember, the Tunisian revolt started as a protest about the price of bread.

Finally, since this is already way, way, way too long for any of you to actually read through, much less comprehend, I'll cut the part about Bretton Woods and the dollar as the international currency super short - there used to be one global financial system that was set up after WWII in a conference at Bretton Woods, hence the name. By kicking Russia out of it, we forced the creation of a competing global economic system. Which will likely be headed by China. That pretty much guarantees another world war down the road, but hopefully not for a decade or two if we're really lucky.

If I had the money to do so, I'd also buy farmland with wind turbines and/or solar on it. Real assets are about to be king, especially food and energy, which are the definition of real assets with inelastic demand.  Oh, and I also just bought a Lincoln, because in addition to chips, the automakers are about to be short on metals too, and somehow a car counts as a fucking growth investment these days.

I'll be honest, the vast majority of my portfolio - over 90%, is in direct registered shares of GME, with a couple shares of popcorn because fuck 'em, that's why. I think at least a couple of brokers are going to detonate like we're seeing with the LME and fuckery like what happened with RSX will become more regular. Whenever I have a big gain in my other positions, I pull most of it out and buy more GME shares and then DRS them.

That IS financial advice by the way, but you probably shouldn't follow it.

For most of my life my sister Alice has been wanting kids but has been unable to carry a baby to full term, in part due to endometriosis. She was in a lot of pain and had to have a hysterectomy. 

Alice and her husband Ben has fostered 5 children and have adopted 2 children with autism, and are great parents. They have a good home environment and are financially very well off. But recently Ben and after a while Alice was bitten by the urge to have a kid biologically related to them because they wanted a chance to ""do things right"" and ""provide the best start in life"" (their views, not mine).  

So they asked me to be their (traditional) surrogate and said that they would cover all costs (legal, medical etc) associated with it. They would be also be paying off my student dent, renting a 2 bedroom apartment for 3 years plus giving me a substantial amount of cash. I said sure - it'll be 9 months of my life in exchange for being set up for quite some time, and my immediate family thinks it is a great idea.

However, when I said ""sure"", I was expecting something along the lines of IUI, where we go to the doctor to get Ben's sperm prepped, me getting shots etc. basically the whole artificial insemination package. 

But Alice &amp; Ben have asked me to well, get pregnant the traditional way. Their rationale is that 1. it is the cheapest way 2. they don't want to go to the hospital given the corona pandemic and 3. they think babies conceived naturally are healthier/the pregnancy would be safer without the chemicals, but I just can't get over the extreme ick factor. And even IF this was going to take place at home I think a syringe would work fine.

Am I going loony for thinking of going back on my word? Is their request reasonable? My immediate family doesn't see anything wrong with it and has been congratulating my sister on her impending baby. On the other hand, if I do give it up am I also mad for passing up what is essentially 200k, especially in this economy now?

Edit: Thank you, I see that I am completely out of my depth here and will be discussing with my sister about alternatives that don't include me carrying the baby. Not looking forward to that discussion though.

All the comments on my previous post showed me that I am way too young, dumb and ignorant with what I signed up with. I started researching actual lived experiences and I read so many horror stories that I've decided to not go ahead with being involved in any way, shape or form with helping them have kids. 

In fact, I'm not even sure if I want to ever get pregnant after all the stories about 3rd and 4th degree tears, poop, miscarriages. I am clearly not in the right stage of life/maturity to even consider doing something of this magnitude.

The difficult part was mustering up the courage to call my sister to tell her my decision. I really look up to my sister and love her lots, and our family and religion has always been about helping others out where we can. 

When I called her to tell her, we had a short convo at first where I basically said ""sorry, can't do it but that doesn't mean I love you any less"". She seemed sad but said she was happy to respect my decision and I thought that was it.

Then just last night, sister &amp; BIL called me back over zoom. My sister was crying and begged me to reconsider, as both of them really wanted biological kids. BIL told me that they were really disappointed in me and hoped that I would find it within me to do this. When I told them my concerns, my BIL just said pregnancy &amp; motherhood is a beautiful and natural process and that I was made for this. 

I'm SO glad I did this over video call instead of in person, because I just hung up on them and faked having connection problems. I've been ignoring their texts so far and frankly I don't know what else to say. 

But any way, thank you all from the bottom of my heart for opening my eyes :)

[**An update**](https://www.reddit.com/user/ThrowRAFE/comments/i777j0/an_update/) - 10 August 2020

Leaving for the airport in a few hours to move across the country and I can't sleep! I plan to slowly phase out contact with my family and community, even though I love the people in there lots.

Long story short, I went over to Alice &amp; Ben's house to visit their kids in May. While there, they asked me in person to reconsider my decision. Sometime during this, Ben started kissing and groping me. I let him. I know typing this out makes me seem dumb for going over and weak, because I was. But I just froze and it was very difficult to say no in the moment especially with my sister crying and Ben having quite a presence in person. Trust me, I have replayed the scenario so many times in my head wishing I was stronger in that moment. Luckily that was the extent of it and I was able to leave shortly after, because I don't know what I would have done otherwise.

I also received surprisingly no support from my parents or my bishop regarding my earlier decision (I didn't tell anyone the recent event). I don't think they knew what Alice and Ben were asking me, exactly, and I didn't bring it up either. I was already sort of an outsider for not really conforming to the usual lifestyle of being married with kids, but this still shocked me.

All these things combined made me reevaluate my life. Working from home and having this much time alone has also given me a lot of time to think about things. I fell down the rabbit hole of reading stories of people who also left the church and I want that life for me. So I've spent the last 3 months making arrangements, transferring to another part of my company, and today is the big day!

I know it's not going to be easy. Pretending to be normal at the last Pioneer Day family gathering was the hardest thing I needed to do, but I did it for myself and for closure. But I'm going to get through this.

Thank you for the advice, and stay safe everyone.

AITA for requesting that my wife cleans up after herself?


 I (28m) married my wife (23f), who well call Dani, about a year ago and we were very lucky to get pregnant soon after. Dani is in her third trimester now and on pregnancy leave. 


Once we got the good news, I started working extra hours in order to save more money for when the baby gets here. This means that I have to get up extra early every morning to get to work (I try to be out the door by 6AM). I get home a little later and Im usually pretty beat, but I still contribute to the house by doing dishes, cleaning up after the cat (coz she cant), that kind of stuff. This new routine has been hard on both of us, but weve made it work and so far everything has been fine. That is, until the other day, when I wake up to Dani crying. 


We only have one bathroom, which is downstairs, and lately Dani has been having a little more trouble going up and down the stairs. This usually went fine, but this time she didnt make it. So, when I came downstairs, I found her, in tears, standing in her own mess. She was clearly very embarrassed and even more so that I caught her. I immediately felt bad for her, and tried to comfort her and told her its all good, it can happen to anyone, just clean it up and well go back to bed. She asked me if I could help her, but I told her that that made me uncomfortable. I would never expect anyone to clean up after my mess. 


Tbh, it has happened before when I had a couple too many beers, but I always clean up after myself and it would feel weird to ask Dani to do it for me in that situation. She got really mad and called me insensitive for making her clean up after herself after an already embarrassing enough situation.I proposed a compromise - she would clean up the mess, and I would get her clean pjs (since Id just done laundry anyway). She asked me if this is what it was going to be like if the baby made a mess, and I told her I would be perfectly okay to clean up after the baby, since it cant clean up after itself. I then told her I didnt have time to stand there arguing with her all night when I had to get up in like three hours to go to work and provide for us. So, I walked upstairs, grabbed her pjs for her and went back to bed. 


The next morning, when I got downstairs, I found her on the couch. She told me that she barely slept and felt horrible about the night before. She called me an asshole and said that by not helping her, I only embarrassed her more. She then told me she would be staying with her mom until I got my shit together. Its been half a day now, and shes not responding to my texts. I talked about it with a few coworkers and Im getting mixed responses, but I just want to make sure& AITA?


Edit 1: So after about 5 hours, most of y'all seem to agree that IATA. Dani's coming home tonight to pick up some stuff, so I hope we'll have a moment to talk it out then. I'll take you guys' verdict into account going into the conversation. I did see some people who would see my side of the story, so I do hope she'll take that into account too. Will update soon!

 
Edit 2: Keeping it brief bc of word limit, will post full update after judgment. 
Long story short: Dani and her mom came to pick up her things last night. Dani and I talked, she told me her side, I told her my side. In the end, we both ended up apologising and agreed we were gonna work on it. She's gonna be staying with her mom until we find a comfortable way for Dani to sleep downstairs at my place.


*Comments:*


&gt;You say you'd be fine cleaning up after a baby because they are not physically capable. what if your child had an accident at the age of, say, seven? would you make them clean up after themselves or?


OP: Fair question. I honestly can't say for sure. Maybe I'd see it as a good teaching moment.


&gt;Teach what? Humiliation?


OP: No, I meant like the gentle parenting thing where you teach kids the logical consequence for their actions: you make a mess (intentional or not, doesn't matter), so you clean it up 


&gt;Why would you choose a username to mock her and the situation?


OP: Didn't mean to mock her. Just popped into my head when I was making the throwaway - it just stuck.


&gt;What do you mean ""at my place""? Are you not married?


OP: She moved in with me two years into the relationship, during the pandemic. Property's in my name, so force of habit, I guess.


OP:  The doctor said she shouldn't exert herself too much, but she's not bed rest, no.


OP: I've seen her crouch to pick up stuff, and the doctor's never explicitly said she can't. But, I've talked to her last night, and she's made it clear that it's very painful for her, which was the first time I heard about it


*Judgment: Asshole*



[Update ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoxxcx/update_aita_for_requesting_that_my_wife_cleans_up/)



So I wanted to post this before going to work, while its still fresh in my memory.


Basically not much had happened since I posted the original thread, until Dani came home later that night. Her mom was with her, but she only helped her load up stuff and didnt look at me or address me once.


While her mom was packing Danis things, Dani sat down in the living room and I joined her. I told her we needed to talk about what happened and she reluctantly agreed.


She explained to me that for her to get down and up on her knees to clean the floor was painful and that it was borderline cruel to expect that of her.


I told her that if she was having so much trouble moving, that she shouldve told me sooner, so we could have worked on a solution together. And if she had explained it to me calmly yesterday, then I wouldve reacted differently.


She thought it was too much to ask of her to spell everything out, and that I need to be more present, both during the pregnancy and after.


I told her that was difficult for me to hear, as I feel that I already contribute significantly and dont wanna feel like she doesnt see that.


She expressed that she does appreciate me putting in extra time at work, but that she also needs emotional support, especially in situations like last nights.


I agreed with her to an extent, but I did try to make sure she understood why I found the situation uncomfortable in the moment, which, after some explaining, she did.


I briefly considered telling her that I talked about it at work and showing her the thread, but Ill take reddits advice to heart and keep that to myself. I wont delete the posts - shes not on reddit anyway.


So we concluded on the following things:


Dani will be staying with her mom (she does have a bathroom on every floor) until weve figured out a way for her to sleep downstairs comfortably (i.e. not on the couch or an air mattress).


Ive apologized sincerely for making her discomfort worse, and she in turn apologized for blowing up at me the way she did, and we mutually agreed we were gonna work on it.


For those of you wishing that Dani leaves me: I love my wife very much, in the five years weve been together weve never had anything like this, and Im determined to make us work again - and so is she.


So, all in all, I think things will turn out alright. Thanks for your insights, reddit, and for making me see that I acted a little out of line.


*I have a hard time believing this was their first problem like this and I believe they will definitely have some work to do on their marriage. But they seem to be happy with this resolution of having her sleep downstairs so I am flairing it concluded*

I (male 32) have a four year old daughter. Lets call her Gracie. Gracie is half black, her mother (female 31) being African American. Her mother over all handled all of Gracies hair care and taught me how to do simple styles but even those simple styles were difficult.

My wife ended up going on a vacation with her friends to celebrate her friends birthday and my mother came over to visit. I hadnt done Gracies in a few days so it became nappy and unmanageable. When I tried to comb her hair the comb broke. My mother said that I should get my daughter a perm so her hair would be more manageable so I took her to a salon and got it permed.

My wife got home and when she saw our daughter she was livid. She screamed at me and then at my mother for even suggesting that but I think shes overreacting because its just hair. Then she brought up our wedding. My mother had tried to get my wife to straighten her hair for the wedding but my wife refused because she wanted her natural hair on her wedding day so she could be as natural as possible.

My mother often comments on my wifes and daughters hair and I agree with my mother. But now my wifes telling me that perms chemically burn and damage hair to change the texture and that I damaged our daughters hair. Now shes thinking of getting our daughters hair cut so her hair can heal from the damages but I still think shes overreacting. Besides, I dont want my daughters hair to be cut. She looks so cute now.

Am I the asshole for straightening my daughters hair without my wifes permission even though Gracie is my daughter too?

Verdict: YTA

**Edit:**

Ive read the comments and came to a realization about my marriage and my wife and now I just feel horrible. My wifes mentioned in passing about her childhood and was always vague about it but after overhearing a conversation between her and my mother in law I just realized how much I truly messed up.

My wife is dark skinned and tall and she got bullied for that along with her hair. She went to a predominately white school in bogalusa and that made her hate herself and her looks for a while. My god my wording was horrible too. My wife is beautiful and so is my daughter and their hair isnt a problem. Im the problem and so is my mother.

After hearing my wifes conversations about me and my mother I realized that my mothers a bully and Im just a drone/follower. My mother constantly picked on my wife and I just stood by and blindly agreed because shes my mom. But that woman who I married is my wife and I should have protected her from& my own ignorance and my mothers ignorance.

I took something she took pride in and belittled it. I was too lazy to learn and took my mothers advice. Hell my mothers said so many cruel things that I didnt think twice of until reading these comments. Shed always make sure my daughter didnt play outside when shed go over her house because she didnt want her to be darker like her mother and that comment made me uncomfortable but I took it as a weird joke.

Im cutting my mother off and Im going to apologize to my wife and daughter and start watching hair tutorials again. Im also going to sign up for a hair braiding class when the pandemic has slowed down once more. God Im a horrible husband and father. When my wife is willing to talk to (I wont force her) Ill apologize and if she wants to leave me over this itll hurt like hell but Ill understand. Ive just pushed her to the sidelines for so long and couldnt even see it.

I am the asshole. The biggest asshole here.

**Edit 2:**

I just got off the phone with my mother. My wife listened in on the phone call, I didnt realize she was in the living room with me until she put her hand on my shoulder during the call. My mother is well, livid. She freaked out on me and threatened to call CPS When I told her I didnt want her coming around my wife and daughter and refused to even try to understand what we did wrong.

Then I mentioned the damage that the perm could cause to my daughter, (I read a small article by a black owned hair care company about childhood perm horror stories along with the history behind perms and Im just& disgusted with myself and my mother) and my mother said my wife was being a drama queen. When I told her my daughter might need a hair cut behind this she flipped out and said I wont let my grand daughter look like a bull d*ke! And I was mortified.

She said shes take my daughter from me and my wife and raise her the way god intended. That caused a screaming match. My wife put her hand on my shoulder in the midst of it and took the phone from home and told my mother if she comes to our home again the police will be called and then she hung up. I put our baby to bed and then we talked. My daughter and wife are beautiful and I dont understand how for the life of me I thought those horrible things.

Maybe it was like that snl sketch diet racism. Hearing those things from your parent and just blindly listening no matter how horrible it sounds. My wife is still mad at me (rightfully so) but she told me she isnt leaving me over this. She said I have a lot to learn and that if I want this relationship to last I need to open my eyes and realize that the world I live in is different from the one she lives in and different from the world our daughter will live in.

Im horrified at myself and horrified at my mother. My father called a few moments ago but I ignored the call. Ill talk to him in the morning about this. Thank you all for talking some sense into me and I thanked my wife for staying with me even though she doesnt have to. Tomorrow we are asking our baby girl if she wants a hair cut. Knowing her shell want to get one like her uncle.

He has these cool designs shaved into hide head. If she wants that she can have that. Shes my world and I refuse to ever be this ignorant and harmful to her again.

**Final edit:**

my wife and I arranged for our daughter to spend the night at my mother in laws house and couples therapy will be in the near future. The comments sections have certainly given me many perspectives of how horrible my words and actions are. I wont be doing any more replies or edits because this is a throw away account. I think thats the right term for this. My mother has called the house multiple times from my sisters phone. My sister is 25 and lives for drama so now the whole family on my mothers side is blowing up my phone with many mixed opinions& most of which are horrible.

Its funny, the only family member whos opinion reflects this comment sections common consensus is the one who was disowned a few months ago. Well actually thats not funny. It shows how messed up my family is. Thank you all for these replies no matter how harsh or mean they might seem, I needed this.

Ok I know the title sounds like I'm spoiled. But hear me out. My brother (20) got a car for his 18th birthday. Not a new car or anything. It was a 20 year old Lexus that was in pretty good shape. And he rubbed it in my face for the rest of the time he was in senior year of high school. Compared with my brother I get just as good of grades as he does. Better in some cases even. I worked my hardest in the hope of fairness. I even did some volunteering cleaning up garbage in my local area. Then my 18th birthday came and went a few weeks ago. And the only thing I wanted, the only thing I was hoping for was a car. I wasn't expecting something like a new car, or a sporty car. Just something reliable like my brother got. The party wasn't anything like my brother's 18th. For his 18th my mom baked the cake herself. It was a delicious layered chocolate pudding cake. I got a sheet cake from the super market. For his they got a DJ. For mine it was my dad's old boombox with a couple of mix CDs. We went through whole party, and I figured my parents might have just been waiting to spring a surprise gift on me. But that didn't happen.

I asked them as things were wrapping up why there was no car when my brother got one. And they said that they felt like he'd worked harder for it. I asked what he did that I didn't do. Because I did all of that and more. My grandma was nearby and heard everything. And then she asked them why as well. She ended up lecturing my parents that she was very very very disappointed in them for showing favoritism. Then she proceeded to announce to everyone still there that my parents thought it fine to get their first born son a car and DJ, but not their second. And then she even pointed out how much harder my parents tried for my brother's 18th birthday than they had for mine. My uncle was the first to stand up and say something. Then everyone else who'd not left yet. I ended up just walking away and going to my room to sit and think.

I got a few I'm sorry calls from relatives. And my grandparents convinced me to go out with them for the evening. But when I got back my parents were pissed, and told me I'd shamed them to the whole family. I just walked past them because I didn't want to fight. The next few weeks went by with the silent treatment between us. But then a few days ago, my parents suddenly surprised me with a white 98 Subaru Legacy that runs great. They practically threw the keys and the title in an envelope at me and said to have fun. I got the car. And they're paying for insurance for the next six months like they did for my brother. I know a car isn't really a right, but a privilege. So I feel like I've essentially blackmailed my parents into getting me one.

AITA for how all this played out?

Edit: I would like to clarify a few things. My parents make pretty good money. And also don't go out of their way to live lavishly by choice. They've always been moderate in everything they buy or do. Though if anything is stretching their finances, it's my brother's college tuition. He got a partial scholarship and my parents are paying the rest. I don't and never intended to ask for the same treatment on that. I want to work and pay my own student loans. Now that I have the car, I'm already looking into getting a part time job.

This also isn't a gender thing as I'm male like my brother. The bill of sale for the car I got says my parents paid $1600 for it. My brother's car cost them about $3000+ if I remember. But I don't see it as a money issue. I actually really love the Subaru. And told my parents so. They did not share my enthusiasm.

I also did try to talk about a car with my parents a few times last year. But they always dodged the conversations about the topic. I figured if I talked about it too much, it'd ruin it. And so I stopped. I would have felt like a brat to keep talking about getting an imaginary car. So I learned to just stay silent and hope.

I can't go stay with my grandparents because they live in a one bedroom condo. There isn't enough room for other people. After all their kids grew up, my grandparents decided to downsize to make their eventual retirement easier. Also my grandparents know all of the details already. And they tell me that I didn't do anything wrong. And were already planning on confronting my parents quietly over the car issue. But they took the chance to take care of the matter when they heard me asking my parents about it.

As for my brother's 18th birthday party, it was held in 2020 during basically the height of the pandemic. Honestly we shouldn't have had a big party like that at the time. But my parents insisted. As for my brother himself, he barely speaks to me, even before he left for college. He didn't show up for my 18th birthday party. And I figured that's just because he's busy with college, and he's not even in the same state as us anymore. Honestly I haven't seen or heard from him since Christmas. And even then the most I got out of him was a mild greeting.

I did thank my parents for the car. Enthusiastically thanked them even. But they've barely said a word to me after giving me the Subaru. And when I thanked my parents, they brushed me off and just went inside. It kind of gave off the vibe that they were letting a brat play with his new toy. Which was pretty upsetting. And one of the reasons I made this post.

Edit 2: There was one more thing I forgot to say. I was really hoping to get the car because I literally couldn't get a part time job without one. We don't live in the city. And we're ten miles from the nearest public bus stop. I've always had to get rides to go anywhere. Now that I have the Subaru, I intend to look for a part time after school job as soon as I can.

Edit 3: Since it came up in so many messages. I want to clarify that when I went to talk to my parents after the party, it wasn't in front of the rest of the family. I intentionally spoke with them in another room and was supposed to be out of earshot of everyone else there. But my grandma eavesdropped and then barged in to start lecturing my parents about their actions. And that's what caused the crap-storm to start.




Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/wxc8yx/update_to_my_parents_getting_my_brother_a_car_on/




Since I couldn't update in r/AITA, I came here to do it. This is my original post Link I've not logged onto this account in roughly five months. So now I can tell you all the rest of what happened before college starts. But before that, there's some things I wanna get out of the way from previous commenters and messagers. I literally needed a car because there was no way for me to get a job without one. I had no personal transportation, and live over ten miles from the nearest bus stop. So for those who kept telling me to give the car back because they think I was either too spoiled and to accept life is unfair, or that I shouldn't take handouts, or I shouldn't except gifts from crappy parents, etc. Please just stop. My inbox was so crammed full when I logged back on that it took some time to go through it all. It doesn't really matter anyway though. I did get a part time job that later went full time for the summer after I graduated. But three weeks into working part time, the Subaru blew the head gasket while on the highway at like 45 miles an hour. The temp gauge redlined and I had to pull over and call for help. My grandparents took a look at the car and found that someone had ran a lot of gasket sealer in it, and it was still in the coolant. The car was basically bandaided back together before my parents bought it, and was then barely hanging on by a thread. It drove great, and I was never pushing the car hard as I'm kinda a slow driver. My parents claimed no prior knowledge of the problem. But their only real reaction was to shrug and say it was karma for making them get me the car in the first place. Well that was a mistake because my grandparents were right there to witness that, and they tore into my parents like none other. My grandma told me to go wait in my room and let them sort this out.

It was two hours before I was called back into the living room. My parents were on the couch and both looked like they'd both been metaphorically hit by a truck. My uncle and two other relatives were there now too. My grandparents had gotten it out of them that when they bought the car, they just looked for the cheapest thing they could find close in the area that still ran, and bought it no questions asked. They didn't even bother to inspect the car, let alone properly read the ad for it. My uncle who knows a thing or two about cars told me that the engine would basically need to be rebuilt because the head gasket warped the block, and it'd cost more than the car is worth to fix it. I had to call into work and tell them I was unable to make it in because my car was dead. They understood and basically put me on a sort of unpaid leave for the moment. Now I want to point out that what happens next I had no involvement with. My grandparents just told me to chill for a while and let them and my parents take care of this. And they did. A few days later they came back with a 1999 Honda Civic Hatchback with 180.000 miles on it. It was white like my Subaru was, and drives great. It's not all wheel drive like the Subaru was. But it's great on the road and gets better gas mileage. There was also a list of all recent repairs done to the car. Things like a new radiator and stuff. My uncle also went over the car before giving it the ok. I thanked everyone profusely. My parents though had all the elation of Ben Stein on valium. They said very little and just walked away. There wasn't even that vibe they had last time of acting like they were giving a new toy to a brat. If I could put it to words, the way they acted was just pure defeat. The Subaru got resold later for $400 since that was the best we could get for it with the blown head gasket. And that money was put into my savings.

That's only one half of what happened though. You see, when I said I did better in school than my brother, I wasn't kidding. My brother got a 30% scholarship after he finished high school. Well I got a 50% one. Not at the same college of course. But at one comparably good that was also closer. To say my parents were shocked is an understatement. Of course they just both looked unhappy as soon as the shock wore off. I decided it wouldn't be a good idea to poke the bear by asking them about it. But my grandma thought otherwise and poked that bear. And I mean REALLY poked it! First she asked if my parents were happy for me. And they claimed they were. But really didn't show in their attitudes. So my grandparents finally asked what their problem was. Why do they dislike me? Their second son was doing great, and even went above expectations. And they can't be happy about it? Did they want me to fail? Were they hoping I'd fail. What is the deal? My mother looked really upset, and my father couldn't look me in the eyes. They both meekly said they were happy for me. And managed to say they want me to take the world by storm when I go to college. And even said they'll help pay some of my tuition as well, just like they are for my brother. My grandparents both sharply said that they better keep their word, because there should never have been any favoritism, period. I thanked my parents for their help. Got a light if not limp handshake from my father, and a very stiff hug from my mother. It all felt so forced. I was and still am extremely thankful for the car and the tuition. But my parents just drained the room of all emotion.

I ended up asking if my grandparents knew what it was that made my parents act this way. I asked if I was an accidental pregnancy or something. And they gave me the ""Its time we told you"" look. Well I'm not adopted like so many asked, but I was unplanned. Sort of.... You see, my parents wanted both a girl and a boy. But got two boys instead. My brother came out as a boy, so my parents were really hoping to get a girl on the next go. And they had a prior agreement to stop after two kids. They never got a girl. My grandma told me they refused to find out my gender till after I was born. They were convinced I'd be born female. And they'd bought a lot of baby stuff for a girl. And they didn't get a girl. My grandma said I ended up using all of my brother's hand-me-downs till I was three years old because my parents had bought so much girl stuff in advance that they couldn't use. So I was just a disappointment to them from the time I was born. My grandparents said that they know my parents are screwed up. But they've been the way they are for so long now that there's no point in expecting them to change.

Since then my parents hadn't spoken to me much about college. In fact they ignore the subject as much as they can. And thanks to some of the warnings I got from people who messaged me making me paranoid, I called the college I've been accepted to and made sure to tell them that if anyone calls or emails pretending to be me, or my parents call trying to say I'm not coming, then to call me for a double or even triple check if anything like that happens. I mean, I kind of doubt my parents would do that sort of thing. Especially after everything that's happened. But I felt like playing it safe was the better option. Though there was something that I really didn't expect to happen. And that was my brother calling me. He called me out of the blue to talk. He said our grandparents called and told him everything. He told me he was sorry for what happened in his own way. And he hopes that once I'm on my own, I won't need to ever come back. He actually admitted to me that when he finishes college, he's going to stay in the state he's in because he likes it there. Our parents I do know actually really want him to come back when he gets his degree. But it looks like that's not happening. I said I don't blame him, and I may do the same. The rest of the conversation was a bit awkward because we aren't really used to speaking to each other much anymore.

My grandparents and the rest of the family held a surprise party for me over the weekend. And they made it almost like a repeat of my brother's 18th birthday. There was a DJ, and a big chocolate cake my grandma made. I couldn't thank them all enough. My parents attended the party. But they were like wallflowers the entire time. They didn't say or do much. Just stayed sitting at a far table in the corner and drank beer quietly. The look of defeat they had was even greater now. I think the party wasn't just to congratulate me, but to also rub in my parents' faces that they should have done better. Because the rest of the family have made their disappointment in them clear. They seemed like they wanted to leave the party for a while. Can't say I blame them. They were being humiliated into staying where they were. My grandma said that you're never too old to be taught a lesson in humility.

As for my personal life. My part time job went to full time after high school, and I've been working hard to build my savings before I leave for college. I made minimum wage, but a job is a job. And I wanna leave it with my best effort put in before my two weeks notice are up. I doubt I'm gonna be coming back here to make another update. And after my first post I'm just so tired of all the negative comments. About 95% of the comments on my original post were positive. And I wanna thank all of those who had nice things to say. You people rock. But the negative comments were so bad that I found it to be mentally draining. Some of the people who commented such negativity honestly feel like they've got worse issues than me. Lots of projecting maybe. If anyone had something harsh but constructive to say, that was fine. But some people just raged at me like they were foaming at the mouth. I really don't want more of that.

You let me down on one of the most important days of my life. While I was giving birth to our daughter you did nothing but complain and criticize me. You complained that I wasn't letting you rest..... I'm sorry I disturbed your beauty sleep but pushing a baby out my vagina was a little complicated. I had been in labor for 2 days, I was scared, exhausted, and in pain. You asked me why I was acting so mean?..... O i don't know maybe because while I was in excruciating pain you couldn't even bother to sit next to me or even look at me. You were too busy making your bed and asking the nurse for more pillows and sheets for yourself. After I asked you to sit next to me you said you couldn't because your legs were too cold and you were warming up.   Instead of asking what I need or thinking about me you were too busy calling my sister so that she could bring you warm pants. You complain that the hospital didn't have a recliner for you, that you were tired, hungry, sleepy, and that I was being mean to you. You said ""If the nurse slapped you right now I would understand why"". You left to answer your phone in the bathroom while I was pushing and the nurse had to go get you. I was so scared and lonely. After 2 days of labor at home, 1 day at the hospital and 2 hours of pushing  and still no baby the midwife offered me the epidural and said that she didn't think I could do it without and you shamed me and made me question myself after I accepted. Telling me to think about what I was doing and that it was unnecessary. You made me feel so humiliated and exposed. After 3 hrs of pushing my baby was rushed to NICU I didn't get to see or hold her. I am enraged that you were the first to hold her, you don't deserve her. I don't even have a picture of me and my baby at the hospital but I have plenty of you laying on a hospital bed holding her. It has been a year since and I can't forgive you. Honestly I don't think you are sorry. I lost the husband I thought I had that day. I want to see you go through the same pain, I want you to suffer so that I can be cruel to you. You complained about me to your family telling everyone how bad I was. On top of all you have the audacity to ask for another child and call me selfish for not giving our daughter a sibling. Im still trying to get over PPD and PTSD. In the middle of the pandemic the only help I could find was taking to a therapist over the phone and instead of giving me privacy ( so that i can get the help you said I need to realize that you did nothing wrong) you listened to my therapy session behind the door and later ask how i could say such bad thing about you. When I first told you how I felt you said sorry and admitted your actions were wrong but now one year later you say that I'm confused and don't remember correctly that there's something wrong with me and I need help. The only thing wrong with me is that I'm still married to you. The only reason I'm still with you is because you are a good (not great) dad and our daughter loves you. ","TrueOffMyChest",10313,10313,0,0.95,19,2,1,995

Gather 'round, friends, and let me tell you a story of ill-advised mixology, daring bluffs, and a host of glamorous and not-so-glamorous exploits.  I'd like to apologize in advance for amy typos; my hands are rather shaky at the moment, for reasons that will soon become apparent.

        ~    ~    ~

The time was 7:00 pm today.  I was sitting in a lecture hall, struggling to stay awake.  I still had two hours of class to get through, and the teacher's droning, soporific voice was doing a grave disservice to what should have been a fascinating topic.  

I wasn't concerned, though; I had a secret weapon.  I reached into my bag, and retreived the vial of *Captain Cow's Particularly Potent Pick-me-up Potion* I had prepared this morning.  I uncorked the bottle and took a small sip of the cloudy red liquid inside.  It burned my throat, and the acrid, bitter taste clung to my lips.  It took half a bottle of water to purge the evil flavors from my mouth.  But then, this stuff wasn't supposed to taste good; it was supposed to get *results*.  I sat and waited eagerly for it to take effect.

Half an hour later, the temptation to drift off to sleep was still there, clouding my mind and weighing down my eyelids.  I decided I needed a little more juice.  This time I took a hearty mouthful, forcing it down my throat despite my body's protests.

That, dear reader, was a mistake.

        ~    ~    ~

At this point, we should rewind a few years for some much-needed context.  This is the part of the story with the daring bluff and the glamorous exploits.

I graduated high school with the help of prescription stimulants, which were only prescribed for a short time.  I took them on an as-needed basis, and squirreled the excess away for a rainy day.  

Fast forward a few years, to the rainiest rainy day in recent history:  the pandemic.  The collective mental health of the world took a nosedive, and I was right there with everyone else, plummeting toward rock-bottom.  I remembered how well prescription stimulants had worked for me in the past, but I didn't want to exhaust my dwindling stash or pay exorbitant prices for street adderall, so I started looking into alternatives.

Dear reader... did you know you can just go on the internet and buy a canister of pure, laboratory-grade caffeine?  I didn't, until one fateful night in December of last year.  I sat staring at my computer screen, my mind awash with new hope and anticipation.  I added the canister to my cart, and pressed the big green button.

As it turns out, ordering stimulants - even legal ones - from an industrial biochemical supply company isn't as simple as ""just push the big green button.""  They wanted to know that I was a responsible scientist working with a reputable research institution, and not, for example, a burned-out college student trying to impulse-buy enough caffeine to kill a horse.  I sat staring at the form for a while, wondering if I was the kind of person who would try to bluff their way through a background check to order soft drugs from a chemical supply company.  The bottle of single-malt on my desk cast the deciding vote.

I woke up the next morning feeling bright and chipper.  (My brain was designed to be alcoholic.  I get anti-hangovers.)  I sat down at my computer and checked my email:  one new message, from a contact at a biochemical supply company.  The events of the previous night came flooding back to me.

*Oh fucking hell ass balls,* I thought.  *They must have followed up with the school.  I'm probably about to be expelled.  Son of a ass, why did I think this would work?*

Heart pounding, I opened the email.

""Dear Cow,"" it read.  ""We're writing to inform you that your recent request to be added to the list of authorized purchasers for Cow College has been approved.  Click this link to complete your order.""

I stared at the screen, dumbfounded.  I clicked the link, still dumbfounded.  I placed my order.  I spent the rest of the year adding carefully-measured portions of semi-legally-obtained caffeine to my tea, making each cup of chamomile the equivalent of eight cups of coffee.  

I was *back,* baby!  

I got back into cooking.  I took up hobbies.  I went on dates.  I pulled all-nighters.  I went from nocturnal to diurnal to nocturnal again.  I did all my homework on the roof (students weren't supposed to have roof access, but I was an exception because I was good at picking locks.)  I saved my declining grades.  I graduated.

I decided to take more classes.

        ~    ~    ~

...which brings us to today, when I decided a swig of *Mama Moo's Probably-Potable Pep Potation* was exactly what I needed to make it through my evening class.

""So, Cow,"" I hear you ask, ""what was in this mysterious mixture?""

Everything, I reply with a shameful grimace.  Everything was in it.  It was half espresso and half tobasco sauce, fortified with pure caffeine, amphetamine, nicotine and methylphenidate.  One sip is the equivalent of washing down a ritalin and half an adderall with twelve cups of coffee.  A shot glass of the stuff would send an adult into ventricular fibrillation.  It's an unholy blend of stimulants and capsaicin in an acid bath.  It's an ill-advised, irresponsible and most-certainly-illegal elixer of inexorable anxious energy.  It should never be imbibed.  It should be sealed in a lead-lined box to protect future generations.  It's a crime against nature.  I should be locked up for creating it.

So now I lie here in my bed, taking long deep breaths, trying to keep my mind and body under control while the concoction slowly drains from my system.  My muscles are trembling, my resting heartrate is 90bpm, and I can feel the adrenaline and cortisol pumping through my veins.  It's a good thing I have prior practice preventing panic attacks, or else I'd surely be curled into a fetal ball of suffering by now.

Don't worry, internet friends, I've learned my lesson.

Next time, I'll only take one swig.

        ~    ~    ~

TL;DR - Today, I mixed up a bottle of *Sergeant Steer's Suspiciously-Strong Stay-awake Sauce* to help me stay awake through my evening class.  It was an unholy mixture of espresso, tobasco, laboratory-grade caffeine, amphetamine, nicotine and methylphenidate.  I underestimated its potency and imbibed far more than I should have.  Now I'm suffering through the after-effects of my satanic swill, trying to keep my mind and body under control until the evil brew has run its course.  Lesson learned:  one. sip. only.

EDIT:  I'm kind of floored by how much people have engaged with this, both to appreciate and condemn it, and I'd like to address a thing or two.

1:  Everything I've described is a terrible idea, that nobody should imitate.  I'm playing up the chaos goblin undergrad character to make for an entertaining read, but the truth is all of these decisions were bad ones.  In hindsight, a couple honest conversations with a psychiatrist would have been a much *much* better way to address my mental health struggles during the pandemic.  Oh well, better late than never, which brings me to point 2:

2:  The concern and support from y'all has been heartwarming and eye-opening for me.  I've written a lot of comments in the past few hours telling people not to follow my example, and I'm realizing I really needed someone to tell me that too.  I'm going to email my psychiatrist tomorrow and set up an appointment.  It's long overdue.  If you or someone you know is struggling with depression / ADHD / feeling unable to function, know that you're not alone, and there are a lot of great people you can turn to for support e 

3:  omg you guys really like my writing that much?  Aw shucks...     y'know... I recently wrote a short story as a comment in another sub... and I was sad that nobody saw it... I think it's much more well-written than this post, so like... I dunno, if anyone is looking for something short and silly to read, y'know =I=H","tifu",9888,9888,0,0.85,30,1,3,889

*This is a repost.* [*The original post*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hfhlrg/aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she_ruined_a/) *is by* [*u/MadeHerRepayTheDress*](https://www.reddit.com/user/MadeHerRepayTheDress/) *posted on June 25th, 2020*

Ex(31) and I(m32) had Claire, (F16) way too young. We're friendly co-parents. One big rule we share is if our daughter breaks something, she pays for it.

Now, sis (27) and I are the only grandkids. Aunt never married. Instead, she worked with Gma and Gpa at their seamstry store, and took it over when they retired.

Sis's girlfriend (29) proposed last year. Gpa offered to make FSIL a custom suit, which she was over the moon about. Gma had me ask Sis what her dream dress was and record the convo. Sis, thinking it was just between us, told me in great detail what her dream dress was, though said it was way too expensive, so she would get something much cheaper.

Well, a few months later Gma surprised Sis with her dream wedding dress. It fit perfectly and everyone cried.

Sadly, Gma recently passed away, which hit us all hard. Sis was devistated, but decided that the dress meant Gma would still be there with us at the wedding.

The issue comes in with Claire. She's very large, much larger then Sis. Three days ago, we decided to go visit Sis and see how she was doing. It was great, but then Claire asked if she could try on the dress. Sis politely said no. Claire made a face, but dropped it.

Later, we decided to go grab dinner. Sis and I went to pick up our orders, but Claire decided to stay and play with Sis's dog.

We got back, and the dress was destroyed. Claire had apparently tried to get it on, popping some seams, and got stuck. Instead of waiting for help, she cut her way out. The dress was hacked to bits.

Sis was devistated and asked us to leave. I grounded Claire, and called Aunt with some pictures, asking if it could be saved. She said there was no. She said she'd make a new one, but it wasnt the same. Then she dropped the bomb on me - Gma had hand sewed most of the dress, used super expensive fabric, and put almost 500 hours in making that dress, since it was the only family wedding we'd have. In total, the dress cost 12,000 dollars, give or take.

Claire has about 15,000 saved from various jobs, as well as winning writing competitions. This was supposed to help her in college.

I took her to the bank and set in motion transferring all the funds, since as her parent I still have control over it. $12k to Aunt to pay for the new dress. $3k to my sister's wedding, as an emotional distress tax.

I explained exactly why this was happening to Claire, but she sobbed the entire time, asking what was she supposed to do for college and saying it wasnt her fault. I told her she could get a job if she didnt get a scholarship, and it was her fault for trying on the dress after she'd been told no, and for not waiting until we got back. A few popped seams could have been fixed. Hacking the dress to pieces couldnt.

Claire told my ex, and while she agreed Claire was in the wrong after the full story, said I shouldnt have ""ruined her future"" for a ""free"" dress. I reminded her of our rule, and she still thinks I'm wrong.

So, am I the asshole here?

&amp;#x200B;

**AITA Judgement:** *Not the A-hole* 

&amp;#x200B;

***Edit #1***

since people are mentioning they dont understand the 3k, that was to make up to my sister that Claire destroyed the last gift our dead grandma ever gave her. I consider that part of the price of destroying the dress, since even if Aunt remakes it, its lost a great deal of its sentinent value.

I pointed out how young we has her because I wanted to explain how a 31 year old has a 16 year old kid. I do not resent having her, she's the best thing Ive ever done. I also brought up Claire's size because Sis has crohn's disease, and thus is very tiny. The dress was made her for size, and Claire is much larger then Sis. I love Claire as she is, but just holding the dress up, it was clear it wouldnt fit.

The character count is very limiting.

&amp;#x200B;

***Edit #2***

To clarify, the money was Claire's ""have fun at college"" money, not her college fund. My ex and I are paying for whatever scholarships dont. When she was asking what she would do for college, she was asking what'd she do for fun and to buy things we didnt pay for. Again, the character count is very limiting, so i had to cut details to post.

Her punishment hasnt stopped there. Ive decided that she will help Aunt in the shop make the new dress. She's also grounded, something her mother agreed with, for the next 6 months. Parental controls on the computer so she cant use it except for homework, no friends after covid ends, no take out, no car, no phone, no video games, no tv, nothing. She's also lost the right to be alone, since she clearly destroys things when left to her own devices, so she has to be in the living room unless she's sleeping at night. I'm also not getting her the dog I promised.

None of this was mentioned because it doesnt apply to the specific situation. But believe me, she is being punished.

If my sister had decided to take her court, as would be her right, my daughter would have lost a hell of a lot more, since I wouldnt be paying her legal fees, and would be on my sister's side. And if she didnt have the money, then Id still make her make it up by getting a job and forcing her to pay every penny to my sister.

She still has other savings, has an investment account and such. This was a light punishment for what she did, and it will continue.

Your extra punishments are absolutely too far and you sound abusive in the way you speak about this situation.

[**OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hfhlrg/comment/fvxx0bv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

She destroyed a 12,000 dollar item, which where I live is a crime that could send her to juvie if my sister presses charges, which she would be in her right to do. These extra punishments keep my child out of jail.

[**Kiki200490**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hfhlrg/comment/fvxxjjv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Prosecutors would be unlikely to pursue criminal charges even if it was reported to the police as the intent matters here. Your sister would have a civil case to recover the 12k though.

I think taking the extra 3k is both rather arbitrary and heavy handed.

[**OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hfhlrg/comment/fvxxp1c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I do agree its unlikely, but i would rather not get to that point. The legal system does strange things at times, and I would rather harshly punish my daughter then for the system to do what we hoped it wouldnt and screw her over even more.

I highly suggest you get her a professional therapist. I think it's unlikely she'll actually confess to destroying it on purpose. Might as well just skip trying to get a confession and get her therapy. At the very least she has a problem with boundaries, at worst she's a vindictive narcissist.

[**OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hfhlrg/comment/fvxxdwv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Unfortunately therapists around me arent accepting new patients, only continuing treatment for current ones. I looked into it after Grandma passed. Its something to look into after the pandemic has died down.

&amp;#x200B;

***UPDATE*** (added in the original post)

So, I got off the phone with my ex about 20 minutes ago. At some of your suggestions, I sent her the pictures, and she freaked. She apparently didnt believe me when I said it had be hacked apart, and believed it was just a few torn seams. She was pretty much on my side after. She told me that she's spent the day badgering our daughter, asking her why she did what she did, and finally Claire cracked and said she was mad that Grandma wasnt alive to make her a dress, and that it was ""unfair"" my sister got a free beautiful dress as a reminder when my daughter got ""nothing,"" despite the many things she was given after the funeral. She tried it on, took it off when the seams popped, and then in anger hacked it apart. If she couldnt have a dress from Grandma, no one could. Her own words.

Honestly, knowing she did it on purpose has just made things worse. The fact that she could be so cruel, thats not the daughter we tried to raise. She will be going to therapy, whether that's in person when local therapists start taking new clients again or on one of those apps people have mentioned. We need to talk about it more. Her punishment stands as is, though we're going to see how therapy goes.

As for all the seamsters who have reached out, please know I'm touched by your kindness. I really am. My aunt is going to see if she can incorporate at least some of the fabric from the old dress into the new one, maybe at least try to save the beading, but if there's anything usable I'll reach out. I so so appreciate all of your offers, youre incredibly kind people.

I have yet to talk to my sister, but I have talked to her fiance. Sis isnt doing well. The stress has caused a crohns flare up, so she's stuck in bed sick. Which, honestly, I'm not surprised. Crohns is often triggered by stressful events, so I was expecting it. I told fiance about Aunt making a new dress, and she promised to take the remains over to Aunt on Monday. She's thankful for us addressing the issue, but has asked for some space from Sis so she can recover and heal, and hopefully not end up in the hospital.

As for the 3k, we'll see what my sister's state is in a few days. If she has to go to the hospital, then the money is forfeit for her medical bills, since it was Claire's selfishness that put her there, so she can pay for it. If Sis does not end up in the hospital, then I'll consider giving it back after she's gone to therapy for a few months, if she's accepted what she did was wrong and worked to make amends.

We'll see what the next few months bring.

[***UPDATE #2***](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq64ky/update_aita_for_ruining_my_kids_life_after_she/) ***posted November 8th, 2022***

Hey everyone. It's been a long time, and a lot of things have happened. I think it's finally gotten to the point where I can post an update that many of you asked for. I'll do shortest update to longest update.

The dress: many of you reached out and offered to try and help, and I'm so thankful to you. I couldn't respond to everyone, but thank you so much. As some of you suggested, Gpa used pieces of the original dress to make accessories for my sister to wear, and she loved them. She'll still wear some of the hair ties for special occasions. My aunt was able to make an almost perfect replica of the dress for the wedding, so while it wasn't the same, it was close.

My sister: she did have to go to the hospital to treat her crohns flare up. It was terrifying, and since she was immuno-compromised she did catch C19. I was so scared I was going to lose my baby sister, but thankfully she pulled through. She is now finally married to her wonderful wife. My ex and I tried to have Claire pay for the hospital bills, but my sister refused to take the money. They do have good insurance, luckily. SIL was still pissed and torn about having Claire at the wedding, but my sister insisted. Claire wasn't part of the wedding party, but she was still invited and joined their special day. While it's not forgotten or really forgiven, my sister is willing to move on, at least.

Finally, Claire. I think seeing her aunt so sick did help kickstart Claire realizing how wrong she'd been, since it was a domino effect of her actions in the first place that started all of this. She herself admitted in therapy it was her jealousy over having to buy a wedding dress in the future instead of having one made for her like it was done for my sister. She does still struggle with her anger at times, but it is getting better. It turns out she used to get all her anger and aggression in sports at school with her friends, which is why she seemed so calm all other times, but being in lockdown just forced everything to build up in an unhealthy way. Still not an excuse for what happened, but at least an explanation.

As I said in an update last time, my ex and I are paying for college for whatever scholarships Claire doesn't get, so at the time taking the 12k for the dress seemed right. I do still stand by that. But after seeing how much she's worked on herself and on trying to repair things with my sister, I have given her back the 3k that my sister didn't take for hospital bills. She's also been working with my aunt and Gpa one day a week as well as editing other's essays to build back up her fun money. I matched 50%, and gave it to her when she graduated. She started college in the fall with a few scholarships, and is continuing therapy. Things are still tedious with her and my sister, but they're working on it. Claire has been trying hard, shown she really is sorry, and is trying to fix things. I still think we have a while to go, but we'll get there.

Honestly, I wouldn't pay for the college at this point. She should've been arrested and charged for the $12,000 in damages. It's not a tiny crime. That's a big crime. I get that your their parent and wanna support them.... but look at the type of person you're supporting.

$12,000 because of jealousy, and the excuse of not being aggressive enough in lockdown made her do it??? =©=©=©=©

She was a child. A mentally ill child. A mentally ill child living in the middle of a major global crisis after just losing a family member who loved her. She didn't kill someone, of course we were going to try and make her better. The idea that I could just easily abandon my minor child so easily is just awful. She paid for it, and does continue to pay for it in her own way.

Honestly kind of unhappy that your daughter gets to just& live her life after what she did. Destroying your sisters last gift from her beloved grandma on purpose. Monstrous. She deserves to never have a single nice thing ever again. I would have taken the money, not had her at the wedding, refused even to be in the same room ever again, and told all her colleges what she did. But you and your sister are better people than me or your daughter. Your sister is a saint and you and your ex sound excellent parents.

[**OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yq64ky/comment/ivog455/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

My sister and I were raised by our parents before they passed that love was unconditional. And while this tested that, it proved true. She was a child. A mentally ill child. A mentally ill child living through a major global crisis. We're not going to punish her for the rest of her life for giving in to her illness. We supported her, got her the help she needed, and while she does still have a lot to make up for to my sister, she's being given the chance. To do the kind of punishment you suggested is just cruel and vindictive, helping no one.

Helpful college student tip! At my university they have groups for specific issues at the counseling center. It might be helpful for her to have peers also navigating anger, in a very frustrating time (i went to one for a different issue and there was even a day we went to a yoga class together: it was great to have familiar faces)

Delighted that your sister was still able to take a little bit of grandma down the aisle with her. It must have been so special

Title says it all, basically my bf has never really been the most loving. He doesn't seem to care about anyone or anything except me, or at least I thought. But when I was looking through some of his old stuff, I found out that he had been diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) which is the medical term for a psychopath. Apparently it's genetic because his father also was diagnosed with it and is currently in jail for killing his wife/my bf's mother. I've read his testimony before and his only reason was 'because I felt like it'. It was chilling, but I didn't think my boyfriend was like that AT ALL. I knew he didn't really care about most people, but he is extremely charming (how he seduced me, I guess).

However, now that I know of my boyfriend's diagnosis, I've been going through our entire 4 year relationship and reconsidering it. In our 4 years of dating, he doesn't really say ""I love you"" out of the blue, he will only say it if I say it first. I never really noticed this but now that I know about his diagnosis, well... that changes things. The way he says I love you is, frankly, devoid of emotions as well. He says it matter-of-factly, not like he actually means it.

There's a lot of other things he does that I guess wouldn't be considered normal? He has never hit me or been physically violent, nor has he verbally abused me, but he treats me like a child. He likes to order me around to do things for him. Everything has to be *his* way. He respects my opinion and will even change his plans to work around mine, but ultimately he is the decision maker. I've pointed this out to him in the past and he says that he values my opinion immensely and that I am the smartest person he has met. I used to believe him, but what if this is just another tactic to manipulate me?

He also has a high-paying executive job and I've heard from his employees that he can be very cruel to them. I would always dismiss their concerns because I thought they were just jealous, but now I realize that isn't the case.

I don't know what to do anymore. Can psychopaths love? Is he just manipulating me? I feel like my entire relationship is a lie, but am I being ableist by stereotyping him based on this diagnosis?

I made a post two days ago about how I found my boyfriends ASPD/psychopathy diagnosis.

A day after I posted that, I finally decided to go and talk to him about it. Since it was a conversation, I dont know word for word what he or I said, but I was taking notes on what he was saying for my own benefit and for the purposes of this post. He noticed that I was taking notes but didn't seem to care/didn't comment on them.  If you just want to see my notes as a TL;DR of sorts, then here is the imgur link (be warned, my handwriting is messy, also the parts that are covered or crossed out is personal information): [my notes](https://imgur.com/uhhP9c8)

Without further ado, here is a summary of what transpired in script form since idk how else to write it. I tried my best to make it the most accurate I could to reality but obviously I cant remember every little thing that happened. Thus, it may sound overly dramatic/unrealistic at times which is why I attached the notes just in case you wanted the raw facts.

Me: Yesterday when you were at work I found some boxes. I was looking through them and found this form *I showed the form with his diagnosis* I was wondering why you didnt tell me about this at all? And I want you to be completely honest, no more lying.

Him: I dont see why it was necessary to tell you. Besides, I made no attempt to hide it.

Me: You do realize that this makes me question our entire relationship?

Him: Why?

Me: Well, how am I supposed to know you havent just been manipulating me?

Him: I was under the impression you were also manipulating me. Were you not?

Me: *is silent because I am shocked*

Him: You have tried to make me a better person. You constantly want me to make friends. You chastise me when I act a certain way toward my employees. I have become your pet project. You believe that your kind presence will make me kind.

Me: You arent a project, youre my boyfriend!

Him: There isnt a difference. Isnt a relationship supposed to be mutually beneficial? I improve you, you improve me.

Me: *is close to tears* So you dont love me, you just want benefits?

Him: I never said that. I do love you.

Me: How do I know you arent lying?! When youve lied this entire time?! (I was getting angry at this point, he was still not reacting)

Him: If you truly believe I am a liar, then nothing I do will prove that assumption wrong.

Me: Well prove that you love me then.

Him: I love the conversations we have. I love that you accept me for who I am. I love your intelligence and wit. I have said it before and Ill say it again, you are the smartest person I have ever met.

Me: But that doesnt sound very psychopathic.

Him: Not everything I do has to be psychopathic.

Me: Well then have you ever killed anyone or anything?

Him: I have killed rodents. Thats it.

Me: *disgusted*

Him: It was a long time ago, I was much younger then and my mother had recently been murdered.

Me: Thats no excuse! Did you kill them brutally?

Him: I suppose. (he described how he killed them with almost glee and Im not going to say it here because it is not good)

Me: Do you feel guilty about that AT ALL!? *I was inching away from him at this point because I was very disturbed*

Him: No. Though, if you are concerned, I have no desire to do that again.

Me: Well, thats good at least. Do you think you would kill a human?

Him: Like my father did?

Me: I guess?

Him: I will never be my father. I dont like that implication.

Me: Sorry.

Him: Why are you asking me all these questions?

Me: Im a bit scared of you.

Him: I have never done anything to harm you.

Me: I know, I just need answers. When did you get your diagnosis?

Him: Eleven years ago.

Me: Okay, but why?

Him: [name redacted] told me I should.

Me: You dont normally listen to peoples advice.

Him: Admittedly, after she mentioned it, I wondered if I had inherited any of my fathers characteristics. So, I went.

Me: Do you think the diagnosis is correct?

Him: I do. Though it has been quite a while, and I never got a second opinion, so perhaps it has changed.

[after this we started talking about personal things I will not share on the internet]

Me: Would you be upset if I broke up with you?

Him: Yes. (he didnt look upset at all)

Me: I think we need to take a break for a month, I need to sort my feelings out. (this seems to come out of nowhere, but I was considering this throughout the conversation, and his lack of emotion was the deciding factor)

Him: *actually looks angry/upset for a second, but then is calm again, so maybe Im just imagining things* After four years together youre going to leave just because of a piece of paper?

Me: Im not saying its forever. I just need to take some time away from you.

Him: Fine. Where will you stay?

Me: Here.

Him: This is my house, and since you are the one breaking up with me, I dont think its fair that I leave.

Me: Whatever.

Him: For what its worth, it would be very unfortunate to lose you.

Me: I dont want to lose you either. But I need a break.

I went upstairs to pack essentials, then I left. Right before, I gave him a peck on the lips. That was a lapse of judgement on my part. I will say that he didnt look happy that I was leaving, and as I was walking to leave he asked me to stay. I said no, he said fine, and left it at that.

So yeah, there you have it. I still love him, and I do think he was genuine when he said he loved me, but Im not sure I can get over all of the things hes done. I went into this conversation hopeful, but as soon as he said he didnt feel it was necessary to tell me, my emotions took over and I started asking way more accusatory questions. To be honest, I wish I had been more logical in my approach, maybe then we wouldve arrived at a different conclusion.

If youre wondering, I am staying with a friend at the moment, he doesnt know where/which friend. I just need this month to regroup and decide what my next steps are. He was one of the best parts of my life, I had never connected to anyone the way I did with him. I have no clue what I will do, and frankly, I need advice. With all that has happened, what do you think I should do? Also, I have no way to prove if hes telling the truth or not, so before you yell at me in the comments saying these are all lies, just know that all I know about his diagnosis is what hes told me. I may try and track down the psychologist he went to, but I think that would be a breach of confidentiality if she told me anything about him. Anyways, please feel free to give me advice.

**Edit:**

A lot of you are bashing me for this, and that is completely fine as you are entitled to your own opinion. However,  as u/vesperjacked reminded  me,  I  forgot  to  mention  that  the  reason  for  his  psychopathy  diagnosis  (not  an  official  term  but  something  that  the  psychologist  wrote  on  his  form)  was  because  of  his  violence  toward  animals  and  the  careless/almost  gleeful  way  he  talked  about  it.  (Stop  reading  here  if  you  are  triggered  by  animal  ab*se)  The  rodents  in  question  werent  random  rats,  they  were  squirrels,  often  babies,  that  fell  out  of  trees.  My  boyfriend  would  see  them,  take  a  cloth,  and  suffocate  them.  Right  before  they  died,  he  would  take  the  cloth  off,  take  a  sharp  knife,  and  carve  through  their  chest.  He  would  then  take  out  their  eyeballs  and  finally  stab  them  repeatedly until  they  died .  When  he  told  me  this  story  he  said  it with  such  nonchalance  that  I  couldnt  even  believe  what  I  was  hearing.  He  was  8  when  his  mother  died,  and  this  started  when  he  was  7  (ended  at  age  11).

I recommend reading u/smigglesthrowaway s  comment  if  you  want  an  analysis  on  the  things  he  said  during  the  conversation.  But  still,  I  do  appreciate  all  the  advice  and  comments.

[**Final Update: My (24F) boyfriend (31M) has always been extremely cold. Today I found out he was diagnosed as a psychopath. How do I proceed?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hxqvrm/final_update_my_24f_boyfriend_31m_has_always_been/) - 25 July 2020

This is the final update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hitxl8/my_24f_boyfriend_31m_has_always_been_extremely/). I wasnt planning on making an update but a few people have asked me for it so here we are. Before I start, I ask that you do not directly insult me. You can say whatever you want about my actions, but I would appreciate it if you dont DM me with insults/attacks. Quite frankly you know nothing about me other than what Ive chosen to share and thus cant make an accurate judgement about my character as a whole, so there is no need to attack me. Im also not directly looking for advice at the moment, this is simply an update post. However, if you want to give your two cents, it will be appreciated! Thank you.

Anyways, a few days after I made my first update post, I was still staying with my friend. I must admit, those first few days were hell to go through. Every five minutes I would think about my boyfriend and want to contact him. I kept trying to distract myself but of course my thoughts kept wandering back. He followed through on his word and didnt contact me, which I appreciate as it made me feel less tempted. However, it was still extremely hard to distance myself when he was literally a text message away. 

On the fourth day of our separation, the friend Im staying with apparently bumped into him at the grocery store. I dont know if she actually came upon him by accident or if she purposefully sought him out, but either way, they had a conversation. She asked him where I was (even though she knew where I was) and he said it was none of her business. She then lied to him and said that she hadnt seen me in a while (apparently in an attempt to worry him). He, again, was not phased and did not contact me, which either means he could care less about my location, suspects Im with my friend, or simply doesnt want to bother me.

In the next few weeks, I continued to try and distract myself by working, studying, or talking with my friends. I also decided to research more about ASPD during this time and I talked to a therapist about the struggles I have faced in my relationship. She gave me a lot of clarity and convinced me that, should I choose to make this work, he needs to come with me to couples therapy in order to work through our problems. Finally, I discussed ASPD and psychopathy with a psychologist who specializes in it. She told me what a few of you said in the comments, that in order to be diagnosed with psychopathy you HAVE to have violent tendencies and show no remorse whatsoever. She warned me against continuing the relationship, because while he loves me in his own way, as soon as I stop benefitting him, he will most likely drop me.

Still, in my naivety, I decided to talk to him as a last ditch effort to save our relationship. I broke my almost month long silence and texted him asking to meet at a park should he want to see me. He said yes and we met up yesterday. I told him that I believed him when he said that he loved me, and that I wanted to make this work, but there would have to be conditions such as couples therapy and counseling for his childhood trauma. I also requested that he act nicer to his employees as I didnt want to be with someone who treated people below him that badly. He immediately shut that down and said therapy was for idiots who dont know how to control themselves. He also didnt understand why he should treat his employees nicely as they were incompetent. He didnt raise his voice (probably because we were in public if Im being quite honest), but his demeanor was very aggressive. He said that I was only calling him out on his behavior because of his diagnosis and that I was fine with him before. However, he is wrong. In this month apart I have realized that I *wasnt* fine with him before, I was just excusing his actions. I told him as such and he got even more annoyed. He asked me why I wasted his time making him come when I couldve just told him on text and been done with it. I told him I was trying to save our relationship and he just rolled his eyes and said he couldnt believe he spent so many years with me. He then left.

So yeah. Could I have handled it differently? Sure. Do I regret what happened? Kind of. But whats done is done and I guess all I have to do is move forward. Im going to have to pick up my stuff from our house later and get my name off the lease. The friend Im staying with has been nothing but accommodating toward me and is letting me continue to stay for a while until I find myself a new place. With the pandemic its going to be hard but Im sure I will manage. Thank you to everyone who gave me genuine advice throughout this journey.

edit: Mood spoiler: &gt;!OP ends up being terminated but not acknowledged as such, but acts like a badass the whole way, and couldn't be happier in the end!&lt;

Okay, where to start. So I began my position in January 2020. Weird interview process, my boss is strange. But whatever, if she leaves me alone I can do my job. Horrible training, I taught myself almost everything. Covid happened, sent home to work remotely. No reason we couldn't have been at home anyways.. I worked from home 2.5 months after starting the role and quickly became the top performer on the team. Woot! I have the largest account in the company, and was given more vendors as well because I could handle them.

Fast forward to 2021, they've been saying we'd be back in the office ""in no time"" for over a year. (Despite management downplaying it and even suggesting it was a hoax, president of the company wasn't an idiot.) We didn't need to be there and we all worked better from home, as they even told us countless times. Told ""you weren't hired to work from home"", but none of us were thrilled about going in to help justify middle management's necessity or their newly renovated, empty office space.

Mid 2021, husband and I decide to start trying and get pregnant right away. My boss suggests we all go in soon because ""covid is practically gone."" Pregnancy goes by, continue working from home. They keep saying that'll change. Finally they say you have to come in 2 days a week. I'm 38 weeks pregnant at that point. Nope. Got a doctor's note. They were pissed, but can't argue with it.

They finally found a temp replacement when I was already 37 weeks pregnant and made me train her. Last minute as hell. Sure. Then she quit. Found another, I had 3 days to train this woman in a job that takes people months to learn. Whatever.

Have baby, enjoy leave, blah blah blah. Monday comes that I'm supposed to start back. Come back to over 900 emails, no word from boss for hours on first day. I find out my temp replacement quit after a week because she couldn't handle the workload. Handling baby and laptop like a champ, whatever it takes.

Boss finally calls me, says hello. She mentions how the team is falling apart (most of the team is older and not in good health), and how we weren't approved for an additional hire that we desperately need. Okay. No mention of coming in. Got an email later asking which 2 days I'm coming in. I replied ""I'm not comfortable, willing, or able to physically come into the office"".

Next morning my boss's boss calls me and doesn't say hello, welcome back, nothing. She says, ""it is company policy to come into the office 2 days a week. If you do not come in, we will consider it your resignation"". I froze and didn't know what to say. Husband and I agreed: let them fire you. You're not quitting. She goes on that they can't make an exception, it's above her (we were told before it wasn't, it's up to each department). She says I need to find childcare, I can't do both. They'll give me until Tuesday next week to figure it out or resign.

It's Monday night. Just sent an email shitting on them and how they've handled everything- my pregnancy, my return, the pandemic, being short staffed. Said I'm surprised they'd even consider losing me with my workload and recent turnover in mind. I'm not resigning. I'll continue to work at home until they say otherwise and my access is revoked. It could go either way, and I don't care either way.

Tldr: new mom, 3 months postpartum. First day back to work last Monday. Remote since pandemic, only hired 2 months before that. Top performer on team. Not planning on going into office. Told it's ""policy"" and they'll accept my resignation. I'm not quitting...

EDIT: Small Tuesday Evening Update. So I haven't posted anything yet cuz there was no update. I fully expected to log on and clock in this morning to a termination email and that would be that. Honestly, I was kinda looking forward to it! Not the case. Radio silence. Nothing. And still nothing. Actually, my boss emailed me this afternoon about some small client issue as if nothing happened. Not sure what to make of that...

[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vj51vu/im_not_resigning_fire_me_bitch_part_2/)

So as you may know from my last post, I just came back from maternity leave last week (6/13) and was told to come into the office for 2 days a week. I said no. I can and will work from home. My boss' boss called the next morning and said come in or they'll ""accept my resignation"". They gave me a week to ""figure it out"". There is no need to be in the office for my role except to justify middle management's existence and our newly renovated building. I sent an email Monday night (6/20, before my week was up) to my boss and her boss saying I am not coming in 2 days a week per ""policy"". I was professional, but honest and brutal. Literally started the email saying I don't believe the feelings of my return were reciprocated. Noted how my role was completely ignored during my 3 month maternity leave, over 800 emails, 800 items in my queue, my temp replacement quit, management not debriefing me upon my return, etc. I mentioned how many branches and vendors were relieved I was back, and thought it was crazy they'd consider losing a valuable team member. Going into the office is completely unnecessary for my position and I won't do it. I am not willing, comfortable, or able to do it.

I'm not trying to get unemployment. I'm not trying to sue for discrimination of a new mom or something. I'm assuming if I get fired vs quit I won't be forced to pay anything back from my leave. Sure, maybe I'm being a little petty too. But fuck it. I can't and won't go in. May as well try to fight it or quit/ lose my job anyways. I have a new baby to care for.

Well a lot of people were waiting for an update. Trust me, I was too. I fully expected to log on the next day to a notice saying I'm fired. That wasn't the case. Radio silence. Nothing at all. They just left me alone to work, the one time I didn't expect them to. Didn't get much done if I'm being honest.

While I was waiting, I found out a coworker on another team was told she could remain working from home. I was livid. Happy for her, but pissed. She lives super far from the office and with gas prices, it's unmanageable to come in. She ended up calling me Tuesday (6/21) and said that her boss emailed her, with my boss' boss cc'ed, and is forcing her to come in now as well. They literally just finished setting her up at home permanently on Friday, and now they're saying nevermind. They want ""consistency"". She was so upset. I never intended for this to happen. She didn't blame me at all though, decided to fight back as well. I had no clue what they're trying to do. There have been a few other exceptions of people not being forced in. Again, we were told it was up to each department originally, but who knows at this point. Maybe they're trying to force out any exceptions so if they fire me I can't claim I'm being singled out and sue or something? Not sure.

Also I was curious and looked on Indeed as suggested. Tons of jobs out there I could totally do btw, some even paying more while remaining remote. (That is, if I decide not to care for my newborn for a bit longer. 3 months isn't enough). Guess what I found... my job. Posted. Right there. Pay and all. The higher end was more than I make! Wanna know the date? Fucking Monday. 6/13. So my first day back to work after maternity leave and they posted my position online as available and urgently hiring. Not sure if it was before or after I originally told my boss no, but I sent my first email after hours so I bet it was before. Also they never use Indeed for open positions. That shit costs money. Oof I was pissed. Told my coworkers and mentioned the pay so they can make sure they make at least that much. Heard from a coworker that someone is interviewing with them this week. Ended up calling off the next day (Wed- yesterday) cuz fuck it. I have sick time.

Well, got another update for ya! My boss' boss emailed me this morning (6/23). Said: ""Morning. I have not replied sooner because I was having conversations with senior leadership and HR. We are looking to change the work from home policy to one day a week in the office. Leadership is adamant that one day a week in the office is essential for communication, training, developing relationships ect. while allowing a generous work/ life balance. Additionally after talking to recruiters one day a week is very generous considering 95% of companies have moved to 3-4 days in the office. You need to understand that if you decide not to come in one day a week, we will accept your resignation.""

Thoughts everyone? Not sure why she thinks I'm gonna fold. It's wild they won't just fire me. I'm not quitting. It's the principle of the matter. Gone too far now to back down.

Tldr: Still not fucking quitting, and not going in either.

[FINAL UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/vlyeu4/im_not_resigning_fire_me_bitch_part_3/)

Morning Reddit. I type this with a weight lifted from my shoulders and my baby boy sleeping in my arms. My fight is over.

Recap: Work was trying to force me back into the office immediately upon returning from maternity leave after being remote for over 2 yrs due to pandemic. I fought, saying there's no reason to be physically in. We perform best at home, as they've said countless times. They came back later lowering the number of days. Didn't matter. Not going in, not able, willing, or comfortable with it. Maybe a little petty, but hell I had nothing to lose. Maybe I could help things change. Found out they made exceptions and were backtracking on that. Saw they posted my position online as open the same day I returned, before I first objected. I was pissed.

Well, I gave it all some serious thought over the weekend on what to do. Can't back down now right? If I said okay, what was the point of my fuss. Fuck it. Husband supports me and is also living vicariously through this lol. I replied this morning to my boss' boss last email with something almost word for word a comment said. (Thanks guys! I swear I read almost every single one.)

Emails below:

Me: Morning, I apologize for the delay. I hope you understand that I have not offered, nor will I offer, my resignation. You cannot accept something that was never offered. I am more than able to work remotely as I have been. I will continue to do so until such time as you determine firing me and losing a valuable employee is the better option. You of course have the right to terminate our relationship and my employment, but to be clear- this is not in any way voluntary on my part. -OP

 ....

About an hour later, I got a call from my boss' boss and HR. NOT answering that shit! I want my paper trail. They constantly say stupid things over the phone and my mind goes blank. I know my limits. She called 3 times! I messaged them saying I'd prefer to keep this over email due to the sensitive nature of our conversation. She replied, ""you have to answer the call"". I ignored another call. I said, ""If you're going to fire me, I'd prefer you just say so.""

20 minutes go by...

Boss' boss: Your refusal to return to work one day a week and answer my calls today has brought us to the point where we will accept your resignation.  We will pay you through the end of the day today, any unused vacation is forfeited.  Your benefits terminate at midnight tonight.   Contact HR regarding any questions about your health insurance and or other benefits.

...

Me: While we can agree to disagree about the need to be in the office, I think it would have been crazy to answer your call this morning considering previous conversations over the phone in the past. Thank you for keeping this over email. You continue to use that word, resignation. I dont think you understand what that means& It was a pleasure. Good fucking luck.

My access was cut. Don't worry, I have copies of all of it. All of my coworkers texted me saying there was a meeting immediately after with the entire department. They were told that none of them are being replaced. I resigned. Management posted my job last Tuesday (lie) because I said that day I was not coming back. They already got 63 resumes and brought seven people in for interviews so far (lie). She doesn't think it will be hard to fill the spot (sure, but turnover) but she wanted them to know that none of their jobs are in jeopardy and that I decided not to come back. Wow. 

My coworkers are all pissed. Some are looking elsewhere for employment, some are asking for raises, and others are just quietly doing the bare minimum. Oh yeah, and I still had over 200 emails that needed my attention and over 1000 items in my queue. Sure, they'll find someone lol.

So there's the end of my saga.

Thanks for all the support! I will be enjoying my time off with my smiley baby, and maybe slowly start applying or see what unemployment says cuz why the hell not right. We'll be okay for a while. (Not why I did this. I was trying to fight for what I believed in. Well aware of the consequences). Lucky as hell to be in the position I am. Husband is so supportive. He brought our little man over to me after I closed my laptop for the last time, bouncing, singing ""mama's got her baby! Mama's with her baby!"" Ugh, my heart!

Some of you suggested I reach out to an employment lawyer. I think I will. Not sure I have anything, but it doesn't look good on them either way and again, I know my limits. I don't know law.

Tldr: new mom, 3 months postpartum. First day back to work 6/13. Remote since pandemic, only hired 2 months before that. Top performer on team. Not planning on going into office. Told it's ""policy"" and they'll accept my resignation. Back and forth a bit. They said I ""resigned"". Smh

For example, my brothers got to go to Disney for their birthday(s) while I stayed with my grandparents. (Fortunately my aunt / grandma took me to Disney few months later)  After being called out, they said they couldnt afford the trip for 5 

As we got a little older my parents had us working in their business after school &amp; weekends.. they gave both my brothers allowances for helping out while I didnt receive anything (&amp; was expected to do more) 

I wish it was just financial abuse though, my parents always said very hurtful things, theyd make comments when I entered the room &amp; I honestly still dont know what I did wrong.. 

When my brother graduated high school,  they gave him an all inclusive trip around Europe for the summer.  When I graduated the next year, I didnt even get a party from them.  

I think the worst of it being they paid for both my brothers higher education but told me to figure it out because they cant afford to pay for 3 college degrees. 

At 18 I moved in with my grandparents full time &amp; decided not to go to college because I didnt want to get into debt or put that burden on my grandparents (who offered to pay for some). 

I did however take them up on their offer to financially support me until I had a job. My grandma gifted me about 5k after moving in with her to help me start an online business I told her about.  

Long story short, my online shop blew up &amp; made well over six figures my first year. Within 5 years 2 online shops &amp; a lot of investing in real estate &amp; stocks I now make way more money than my parents ever made combined. 

During the pandemic my parents had to shut down their restaurant &amp; are still struggling to make ends meet.  They are also unable to pay for their mortgage &amp; are afraid theyll go homeless if I dont support them.  They also have a lot of medical bills after my father got into an accident and needed surgery for his knee 

I being so grateful for everything my grandparents and aunt have done for me decided to get my grandparents their dream home &amp; paid off my aunts debts for medical school.  After realizing I can also easily afford to pay off their debts / mortgage, my parents have been begging me (literal tears) to save their home but I refused.  They told me I am an asshole &amp; I deserved my upbringing &amp; that I shouldnt be punishing my siblings and forcing them out their homes for the actions of my parents.  Im not punishing my siblings though, Ill be more than happy to support them (especially my baby sister) if she comes &amp; stays with me or my grandparents.

Names have been changed, I'm 55 and Amelia is 32.

My husband and I have two daughters, Opal and Amelia. Opal and her fiance Jack passed away four years ago. Her wedding dress had been bought and my baby never got to wear it. I kept the dress, I don't look at it much anymore, but it's just one of those things that remind me of her, and also Jack who I viewed as my son.

Amelia is getting married to Liam. She asked me if she could have Opal's dress, she said she loves the style/design and wants to tweak it a bit to better match her tastes. I said no, Amelia told me that Opal didn't wear it so no one's seen it, and I can't keep it in a corner gathering dust forever. I've insisted no multiple times and that Amelia can get her own dress, maybe similar to Opal's design but she can't have this one. Amelia said life is for the living and I'm making things harder for her, she offered to pay and buy it from me but I still refused. It seemed like Amelia understood, but this past weekend our family and Liam's family went to dinner, his mom pulled me aside and said that Amelia is upset about this whole thing and the wedding planning is already difficult, so I could compromise and make it a bit easier for her by giving her the dress. Now I'm thinking if I really am being unreasonable? My husband thinks I'm in the right but some third party opinions would be nice.

I replied to a few comments and some people said I should edit it in, but it went over the word limit so I couldn't. I will link all my replies

[1st comment](https://www.unddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x3vvi8/aita_for_not_letting_my_elder_daughter_have_my/imrvlsw/?context=3):

&gt;Opal's dress was custom made from a local boutique that closed down during the pandemic. Amelia likes the design which will be very expensive to recreate from somewhere else now. We've had multiple discussions about this and I've said that she's welcome to use Opal's dress as a reference to get a similar one, but she insisted she'll just take this one and tweak it to her liking. As mentioned in the post, her reasoning is that Opal never wore it and no one will know it was hers, so it's okay for her to wear it.

[2nd comment](https://www.unddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x3vvi8/aita_for_not_letting_my_elder_daughter_have_my/ims0wvo/?context=3):

&gt; Id love if we got more info

&gt;Amelia has never told me she wants the dress for sentimental reasons. She said Opal never wore it and no one's seen it, so it's okay if she wears it. We've had multiple discussions on this topic and Amelia said that I'm playing favorites and life is for the living, which I'll be honest hurt me a bit. As far as their relationship went, Opal and Amelia got along well enough most of the time. Amelia's boyfriend at the time lost his job and here Opal was getting engaged and planning a wedding and all that. Jack was an attorney, Opal was finishing up med school, and Amelia felt they were trying to one up her. Opal called Amelia's boyfriend disgusting and some other names which made the situation worse. My husband and I were contributing to Opal's wedding (we said we would offer x amount to both our daughters for their weddings), and we had to lower it to help Amelia out a bit.

&gt;Amelia was upset after their deaths but went through it at her pace and came to terms with it. We never really discussed it much, if that makes sense? I felt we were all just healing in our own time. Amelia has made it clear though that she thinks we're holding on to the past.

&gt;Hopefully that answers some of your questions.

&gt;She said I'm playing favorites because I'm not prioritizing her, and intentionally making things harder when giving her the dress would get one thing checked off the list. I would like to say that my husband and I were equal to both daughters, but the truth is we weren't. It doesn't mean we loved one more than the other, but this is just what it was like. We paid for Amelia's college fully, Opal got a fraction of that. When they were teenagers, Amelia wouldn't do her chores to go out with her friends, we never told her off for it and Opal would do her share and Amelia's. When Opal got her first job, she saved up for a long time to buy these expensive earrings. Amelia saw it, wanted it and the next day we went and bought the same pair for her. Even for Jack and Opal's wedding as I mentioned, we were going to contribute x amount but took some of it back to help out Amelia. Things like this.

&gt;Opal never said anything to us about any of this, although now looking back I can see this was completely unfair. I will be honest, I feel like I let her down her entire life, so I would like to keep the dress not just as a memory, but also like a ""see, this one thing is truly for you"". So this is what the prioritizing means, that I'm not helping out Amelia now and ""prioritizing"" Opal, who's no longer with us.,

[4th comment](https://www.unddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x3vvi8/aita_for_not_letting_my_elder_daughter_have_my/imspc7a/?context=3):

&gt; INFO : how come you have the dress ? did you take it or are you the one who bought it ?

&gt;Jack bought it for Opal as her wedding gift. I asked Jack's mom if she wanted it, but she declined and told me to keep it.

Thankyou for your kind words, even if people had different opinions most of the replies were kind and understanding. 

Sorry if the title was confusing as I saw some comments misunderstanding the ages, Amelia is my elder daughter. She's 32 and Opal would've been 30. Also some people were asking about how they passed, I don't want to go into details but it wasn't accident or s\*icide.

Last night Amelia came over and we had a long heart-to-heart discussion about everything, in relation to not only the dress but me and my husband's treatment of both Amelia and Opal in the past, and the effects of it. I wasn't sure if Liam's mom talked to me on her own accord or if Amelia had told her to. I asked Amelia and she said that she talked to her about all of it, and Liam's mom agreed that her having the dress would make things easier. She suggested speaking to me about it and Amelia agreed, but Amelia herself didn't ask Liam's mom to talk.

I told her that if she wishes to wear Opal's dress without making any sort of tweaks (outside of tailoring to fit), I will let her borrow it. Amelia didn't agree, as she's mentioned that she wants to alter it to fit her tastes. There were a few things that were brought up. I explained to her that our treatment of her and Opal were unequal when the girls were growing up (which was a parenting issue on our part and we'll fully take the blame), but she's not a child anymore. Amelia listened, she said that that's irrelevant because Opal and her had different personalities and different needs.

I asked Amelia if the reason she wanted the dress is a monetary/time issue or if there are any other reasons behind it, and to be open with me. She said outside of that, she views the dress as a sort of grand gesture Jack made about his love for Opal, spending a lot of money for her custom gown. She told me that she wouldn't have asked for the dress if they were still alive, or if only one of them had died. Liam won't be buying a dress like this for her, so she can use the romantic sentiment behind it for her and Liam's love now, as neither Jack nor Opal are with us (so by extension any trace of their relationship is also gone).  I will be honest that this didn't sit right with me at all. I did stand behind my decision that she can't have Opal's dress. Amelia agreed and said that she'll start looking around at dress shops, and I offered to come along with her if she wishes. Amelia has made it clear that she thinks that I should be over it by now, but she has accepted that not everything will go her way and importantly, she won't be getting the dress. Overall our talk ended positively enough, with a lot of deep conversation.

This ended up being quite a long post but I wanted to answer some of the questions that people had and also include a bit of the conversation I had with Amelia. Again thankyou for your replies and messages.

Not without the final say, I cant!","At my last job, my boss (lets call her K) hated me. She turned everything into a competition; she mocked me publicly; she took credit for my work; she divulged my personal medical information in front of all our coworkers. She was cruel, and needless to say, I avoided her as much as I could. 

So, now that the stage is set, heres the context. End of 2020, corona virus blazing, I had just had my first baby. I was a nervous wreck my entire pregnancy, working from home and being extra careful. After maternity leave (which was disgustingly short btw), I had returned to the office with some precautions set in place. My boss became crueler to me over those first few weeks back, and suddenly announced that, regardless of any negative feelings toward it, she had decided we all had to attend this training in another state. Keep in mind that there were mandatory 2 week at-home quarantines in place for anyone coming back to my state, but my boss fully planned on ignoring those quarantines and demanding we all would return to the office as soon as we got back. 

I was carrying a heavy workload and pulling a lot of the weight around the office, and I had some rank. So, I felt fully comfortable expressing my deep concerns to K, telling her that it was peak covid season, and that I had a newborn to worry about now. I expressed I simply didnt feel comfortable going in the middle of a global pandemic and asked if there was a remote training I could attend instead. She firmly, ADAMANTLY insisted there was no remote training, and informed me that I could quit if I was that upset with her decisions. Its important to note that she insisted this for weeks, even claiming to have contacted the training organization to make sure. I decided on the spot after that meeting that I would be quitting. But I needed to check my boxes first, which took me a few weeks to figure out. 

Some time after this meeting and her incessant insistence that there was no remote training, it finally occurred to me to check with the organization putting on the training and ask them to clarify if there truly was a remote training or not. I did, and lo and behold, there WAS - and they had been offering it for months. I asked them to email this information to me. 

Now to figure out how to use this valuable information, right? Wrong. As soon as I stepped back into the office, K starts fake-empathizing with me out of nowhere, in front of all our coworkers. saying she really wished she didnt need to force me to go to this training. So, I said, if you feel so bad, let me go to the remote training. She looked at me in surprise, and her face turned beat red. Before she could fight me, I pulled up the email with the information and read it aloud in front of all our coworkers. No one said anything, they just stared, wide-eyed at her while she blubbered like a fool. 

Long story short, after pulling that fast one on her, I pulled her into a private meeting a gave my notice. She was horrified because, as I stated prior, I carried a lot of the work around the office. 

But, like she said, I could quit if I didnt like her decisions >7<û@","MaliciousCompliance",8425,8425,0,0.97,0,0,0,254

I'm sorry, I don't remember the exact term for my condition. Basically, I have the correct parts, none of them happen to work. My uterus cannot generate lining, so I can never get pregnant. The bright side is that I have never had a period in my life (I'm 32). My boyfriend's mother found this out, I don't know how, she may have heard a family member talking about it, my family knows about it, and several of his family members that I have told. When she found out and confronted me about it, she then forbade her son from marrying me because I couldn't provide him with children. Needless to say, we (my boyfriend and I) have discussed it and though a bit disappointed, are fine with it (me unable to conceive). She is now telling all her family members not to attend our future wedding because she doesn't want her son marrying someone ""defective"" who can't give him what she thinks he wants/needs. If she can come around and change her mind on this, that would be great, but as it is right now, I don't want her at the wedding, for fear of her doing or saying something to ruin the event, and he says that while he loves his mother, he is torn as to whether to invite her or not. We may just have a quick civil ceremony and only invite a few friends and relatives and tell her later, but she doesn't even want to come over when we invite her for dinner. Not sure what to do, getting tired of her calling me ""defective"" to everyone else. His father is OK with it, his aunts and uncles are understanding for the most part. We have talked about adoption in the future, but she is also against that as it is not ""his blood"" and wouldn't ""really"" be her grandchild. Just ranting here, thanks for reading.

***Relevant Comments:***

""For the commenter who said she would find something else anyway to complain about, my boyfriend's best friend came over for dinner last night and we told him that we might not have a wedding, just a simple civil service at the courthouse and told him that his (my boyfriend's) mother is the reason for our change in plans and he started trying to guess what could be the reason. It ranged from joking about my size (I'm 6'1"" and 3 inches taller than my boyfriend, and yes, the weather is fine up here and no, I don't play or even like basketball, I get those a lot) to the fact that we are currently living together, pre-marriage. When we told him the actual reason (he already knew of my condition), he was quite shocked and said he'd be there for us no matter what. That and all of your positive comments on the situation have helped me to calm down. I was so upset about this and about to walk out the door and leave him and move on with my life and I definitely didn't want to feel like that was my only option. My boyfriend is going to confront his mother about it tomorrow night (he has to do some stuff for work tonight, thus the delay) and I'll update how that all turns out. Thanks again.""

*More about OOP's condition specifically:*

""I do produce eggs and we have to use birth control, because the doctors don't want a fertilized egg starting where it shouldn't be. My best friend since I was 3 has volunteered to be a surrogate if we need one, but I don't want to take her up on that as all 3 of her births had complications so I wouldn't want to put her through more.""

**Update Comment: December 10, 2019 (Same Post)**

""I have received two text messages today before tonight's confrontation; one good, one bad - The good one was from my future father-in-law who said that he's appalled by his wife's actions and he loves me like the daughter he never had and he thinks his son is fortunate to have found me. The second was from his aunt who basically said the same thing, but added that her sister (my future mother-in-law) spoke to her about the whole thing, asked her not to attend the wedding, and then made some comment about why do I even have breasts, it's not like I'm going to use them for anything. I am so nervous for tonight, my boyfriend has asked me not to come because he thinks my being there will make it worse, so after work I'm going to stay at home, order in a pizza and curl up on the couch and watch tv while petting the cat. That last part is not a euphemism, I get a lot of comfort playing with and petting my cat.""

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/e9qy1r/fmil_won_im_no_longer_in_her_sons_life/)**: December 12, 2019. (Future Mother-in-law won, I'm no longer in her son's life)**

If you read my previous post on the matter, I can't have children, my soon to be mother in law didn't like that and did what she could to sabotage our future wedding, telling people not to attend, and calling me ""defective"". My future (no more) husband and his father were going to sit down with her Tuesday night and try to talk sense into her. Well, she won. I don't know what happened or what was said, but my boyfriend came home and we got into a big fight. Despite what we had discussed before, he now said that he wanted kids and if I couldn't provide them, the wedding was off. I basically said ""that sounds like your mother, not you"", he replied with ""I can speak for myself"" and it escalated into a bunch of shouting at each other and I quickly put together a bag and went to my parents for the evening. I called in sick from work the next day and basically stared at the ceiling. We first met when I was 9, 23 years ago, it went from being friends to more romantic, we dated through high school and went to college together, then after graduation, moved in together. I have never dated or seen anyone else, neither has he as far as I know. We waited so long to get married, because it wasn't important to us as long as we were together. That changed when my dad got a terminal disease and he expressed his wish to walk me down the aisle (I'm his only daughter) before he became too ill to walk.

I'll be giving 2 month notice at work on Monday, to give them time to find a replacement and for me to train them, then moving back to Germany. (I didn't mention that my dad is German, my mom American, they originally met when she went there for work) I was born there and lived there at first and still have friends and family there. My friend, who I had mentioned before had volunteered to be a surrogate, has said I can stay in her spare room with her and her family until I get situated on my own there.

I'm sorry, no happy ending here. The evil mother in law won and got me out of her son's life. Technically, she got me out of the country. I know I could move elsewhere in town, or even in the state, but I don't want to be alone here, there's too many memories, and I have a strong support group (friends/family) overseas so that's where I'm going. I have been picked on so many times for so many things over the years (from my height to my accent when I first moved here (gone now, I sound like any other midwestern girl) to other things), but this one hurts. I was able to handle the others by telling myself ""that's who I am, if they don't like it, that's their problem"" and I'm sure in a few years, I'll think that about this situation too, but it's too soon. Thanks for reading and your kind words of support. I'm sorry if this seems incoherent, I'm just ranting here and crying, so it's hard to keep a decent train of thought.

**Update in Comments: Same Day (Same post)**

First of all, thank you all for your support and kind comments. Two weird things happened today, One I'm extremely embarrassed about and the other I thought was just weird. First, on my lunch hour, I had to run to the grocery store to pick up some things for my mom for dinner tonight. At the grocery store, who should I happen to run into but she-who-once could have been my mother in law. I don't know what to call her, so she will be Barbie. Walking down an aisle, who should happen to appear at the other end, but Barbie. We made brief eye contact, then she immediately turned and bolted out of there. guess she had nothing to say.

The second thing was my dad came with me to the house to help me pack up my things. He's already agreed to act as my representative when the house is sold to make sure I get my fair share. While there, he stands in the corner and just glares at my ex the whole time. Then my ex has this brilliant idea to ask for ""one last time"" right in front of my father. I guess I kinda snapped. I grabbed my sweater (you can guess what part of me was right under it that I grabbed) and said ""You are never going to see these, much less touch them or play with them again or anything else"" he turned red and walked out the door, and my dad went from staring with a ""You hurt my daughter, you're lucky to be alive"" look to just bursting out in laughter once the door closed behind my ex. He then said ""I can't believe you just did that"" to which I replied ""neither can I"". for this and the rest of my story, anytime my dad and I speak to each other, I am translating it to English beforehand rather than typing it twice. I just basically felt myself up in front of my dad.

we then went home for dinner with my mom and halfway through, my mom asked ""what does Vanessa's (the girl I'm moving in with in Germany) husband do again?"" and I just lost it. a perfectly honest question, but I just let it all go in big braying sobs. After a while, my dad came over and carried me upstairs to bed like he used to do when I was 5, where I am typing this now on my laptop. I told him to tell mom that she did nothing wrong, I just needed to release and unfortunately for her, that was the time.

A lady at work already volunteered to take my cat, and my dad will store stuff like my tennis trophies and yearbooks and pictures upstairs at his house. He said that even though I may not want those photos now, perhaps in 5 years or so, I will want them, so he's gonna keep them until I'm ready to take them back.

Thanks again for all your kind words and support. I will update as warranted and answer any further questions if I can.

**Update Comment: December 13, 2019**

Well, I gave notice at work today, had some more weirdness, and am now lying in bed with my laptop. First - while at lunch today, a dozen roses came with a note that simply said ""I'm sorry"". No more, no less, but I recognized the handwriting. I asked my coworker if she would like them to give to her little daughter at home and when she said ""no, I know why you got them and I don't feel right taking them"", so in the trash they went with the note. I was going to wait until Monday to give notice, but the gossip factory had been running full time the last couple of days, so I went and told my boss that I'm leaving, but I'll stay to help train a replacement. My last day is ironically Valentine's Day. What the hell, I've got nothing else to do that day. I'll spend two weeks after that here saying bye to people, going to a few of my favorite places in town and then on February 29, my parents are going to drive me to Chicago, about 4 hours away, and I leave for Munich on March 1. My friend Vanessa lives in Munich, so I'll stay at her place a few days while I try to figure out where to go and what to do. My hometown is about a 2-1/2 hour drive away and I still have family there, so I'll decide between now and then which one to base myself in. It's a small town(maybe about 40,000, I'm not sure the exact number, but it does have a castle and a large tin soldier museum), so I don't know if I'll stay in Munich (more opportunities), go up there and try to find something, or go somewhere else in Germany, like Hamburg or berlin.

I also went to the realtor who's selling the house and had to sign a bunch or papers giving my father authority to make any decisions regarding selling. the lady said no problem, she has a lot of experience with divorcing couples, and all I thought was ""I was never even married"".

I came home and we had dinner, then my mother and I sat down and she braided my hair. It has always been our thing to do this for mommy-daughter time. We did it for the big ""It's not just for peeing"" talk, when I was first diagnosed with my condition, before the state tennis tournament, when I went away to college, basically big moments. I think this counts as one of those.

Then my ex's best friend called, said he heard what happened, said it was pretty crappy (he used stronger language. but there might be children reading this) and wanted me to come over for an evening with his family before I left. I was more friends with his wife than him, but I'll go anyway.

Again, I can't thank this community enough for their support and kind words. sorry if I branch into irrelevant topics at times, but I just type as I think, and this is all going faster than I thought. Last week, I thought I might have to start planning for a wedding, and now, I'm planning on leaving the country and starting my life over.

My mother also suggested we go to the zoo in Chicago on my last day in America. I went there when we first moved to America, she thinks it would make the perfect bookend to my whole 23-year stay in America. It seems like just yesterday when we moved into a new house and a nice boy and his mother came over, brought us a basket of cookies, and welcomed us to the neighborhood while I was out front keeping my dog away from the movers. times (and people) sure do change.

***Relevant Comments:***

*A user is rightfully disgusted and baffled at the ""one last time"" comment:*

""He was never like that or I wouldn't have fallen in love with him in the first place. It's almost as if his switch was suddenly switched from ""good"" to ""evil"" (Simpson's reference). He used to be embarrassed to even hint in front of my father that we were having sex, then he has no problem asking for one last time in front of him. My co-worker said that I should treat it as if he had died, and mourn the loss and move on, and someone else took his place.

I also don't know why after receiving supportive emails from a couple of his family members (his father and aunt), I've now heard nothing since from either of them. I didn't know his mom had that much power over them. Then again, I didn't know until recently how much power she had over my ex.""

*A commenter hypothesizes maybe he would have been written out of the will:*

""I would have thought that too, but they don't make much, enough to live on, and have no holdings I am aware of. But maybe there's a secret stash somewhere that only family knows about.""

**Update in Comments: December 19, 2019**

Update- warning; there is an act of violence in here and I'm still shaking from it. No, the main one wasn't against me depending on how you define violence. My ex came over to my parents tonight and said he wanted to talk. I have a good idea what he hoped would happen, but it definitely did not. We had a brief chat in which he said he was sorry and I told him I was moving back home to Germany soon. He started to tear up and so did I. I take responsibility for giving him the opening that was about to happen. We're both crying and we start hugging. As we're hugging, I don't notice one of his hands moving down my back to my ass until he gets a good handful of ass cheek and squeezes it. As soon as it registered in my brain what he was doing, I stepped back and let loose with my 6'1"", 155 lbs. (I'm a big girl) and 25+ years of developing a good forehand in tennis and just slapped him in the face. My hand still stings from the force of it. He staggered back and I just pointed to the door and yelled ""get out!"" though I may have added some naughty words with it. He looked shocked at me and hung his head and just walked out the door. After I heard him get in his car, start it, and drive off, I broke down in tears. My father, who had been waiting and listening outside the room the entire time (he later explained it as listening to see if I needed backup), came in the room to me crying more at this point and he started to give me a big hug. A couple minutes later while he's holding me, I thought that he might reach down and squeeze the other ass cheek. That thought sent me into hysterical laughter. We stood there holding each other while I'm alternating between laughing and crying. My mother comes downstairs and fixes us all something to drink. A few minutes later, my phone rings and according to caller ID, it's Barbie (my ex's mother and the one who started this all). Now I did not hear her side of the conversation, so anything attributed to her is what my father told me later. She basically says she's gonna call the cops on me for assaulting her son and my father says it was justifiable self-defense, my ex attacked me first (the ass squeeze) and we have cameras to show the whole thing to the cops should they show up (we don't, but she doesn't need to know that). She hung up and I haven't seen a cop since so I don't know if she was bluffing or my dad's threat scared her off.

Now I will admit that I miss the physical part of our relationship and he was my first and only at many things (first date, first kiss, first sex, etc.), but none of that outweighs the hurt he and his mother caused me. I would rather go celibate for life rather than let him touch me again. I shouldn't have let him hug me in the first place, but it was a weak moment and I know not to let him do that again. Again, thank you for reading and the kind words of support. I thought I wasn't going to update again after the last one, and yet something else happened. Hopefully, unless it is a response to something written here or a message, you won't get another update from me until I am in Germany and away from this mess. It's late and I'm going to bed now.

**Update in Comments: January 14, 2020**

Update: one mystery solved

Throughout this whole ordeal, there have been 2 mysterious things I had no answer for. 1 is why did he suddenly change his mind and 2. How did Barbie (his mother) find out? It wasn't common knowledge, nor did I tell her. I had my suspicions as to how and yesterday, they were confirmed.

Was downtown on my lunch break. Been training the new girl who's replacing me, she seems really nice and capable, I would have liked to work with her if the circumstances were different. At lunch, I ran into Steve, his friend and neighbor who he's known since he was 3 (or 6 years pre-Mia). He said he had heard about us. He said it was a shame that we had ""broken up"" and wanted to know if it had anything to do with my infertility. Now, I had not told Steve, he wasn't a close enough friend to confide in, so I asked what he knew of my ""infertility"". He then told me the whole story. This is from his point of view and I'm only relaying what he said, so may not be 100% accurate: Steve and Jack (my ex) were working on Steve's car (don't know what kind, only that it's from the 60's (I'm not a car girl, never have been. 4 wheels, an engine, and a good stereo system is all I need to know. If you ask me what kind, I would say it's blue and old, nothing more). Now, before this, we had a very informal proposal: what do you want on your toast, it looks like it's gonna rain today, should we get married. so they went to Jack's parents house, he wanted an old heirloom ring that had been in his family for centuries and wanted to make a formal proposal. He asked where it was and why he wanted it, and his mom ran crying with glee upstairs to find it. when she came back down with it, she was crying and said it would be nice to have the pitter patter of tiny feet around the house and was I currently pregnant? It seemed odd to her, I guess, that we were getting married after 16 years of dating/living together, so she thought maybe he had knocked me up and that's why the proposal after so many years. He said we already had the pitter patter of tiny feet in Babette (my cat), she said ""No, I mean a baby, silly) and he responded with ""Mia can't have babies"" and then proceeded to tell her my whole medical situation. she said something like ""this isn't going to happen"", went back upstairs, returned the ring, and slammed the door. the next day is when she forbid (forbade?) me from marrying him, started calling me ""defective"" and started this whole story.

After telling me this story, I told Steve that yes, that is one factor in our break-up, he said ""what a shame, you two made a great couple"", and Jack was probably devastated. I then said bye and went on to lunch, and when I got home later that day, I went to my room and cried into my pillow before my father came up to get me for dinner. I had always suspected that he told her somehow, and while it's not a big state-secret, it's not something I have ever felt comfortable telling people. Now that I am telling this story on this site, I have no problem saying ""my parts don't work"" to complete strangers and it's been comforting. thank you all for your support, and I leave for Germany on March 1st. I'll try to answer any questions you may have for me before then, but I guarantee nothing as I'll be kind of busy with packing and doing my ""farewell tour"" around town (saying bye to old friends, going to restaurants I like and won't be back to in years, if ever, things like that).

So that's one mystery solved, and the other could be solved if he would just answer it, rather than taking any form of communication I have with him as some sort of desire for him to get in my pants. Thanks again for your words and support, and barring something big happening between now and then, the next part of my story will come after March 1.

**Update in Comments: April 10, 2020**

Two part update. We'll start with the good first. I left America March 1 and flew to Munich. Sat next to an elderly lady who was scared to death of flying, but was going to visit her son and his family (I don't remember what he did or why he was in Germany). So for the 10 or so hours we were in the air, she held my arm in a death grip and anytime we hit an air pocket or shook around a little (it was a relatively smooth flight with just a few bumps here and there) she gripped even tighter and later I discovered I had a bruise, but fortunately her nails didn't dig in. After deplaning and going through customs, she met up with her son and his family. This happened before all the quarantine and isolation started in earnest, so not much of a problem there. Then all the fun started with the quarantine and I've spent most of my time at my friend's house, tutoring her kids in English and generally helping out around the house. I had 3 interviews scheduled before I got here, but they were all cancelled. My Uncle up in Kulmbach has volunteered to drive the 3 hours down and take me back up there, but I haven't decided yet.

The bad - apparently Jack (my ex) has been having a hard time with this. Normally, when I and the family flew back to Germany in the past, we flew out of Cedar Rapids, up to Chicago or Minneapolis then flew on to Germany. Apparently, from what a friend told me, he drove out to the Cedar Rapids airport, not knowing we had driven up to Chicago and I flew direct from there. when I didn't show up there, he went home and figured he got the time/date wrong. He sent a few letters to my house, I had my mother open and read one to me on the phone, but shortly stopped her. Even though my mother and I have been open about my sex life, there were things in that letter I didn't feel like hearing or having her hear. The letters stopped when he lost his job for non-quarantine related reasons and later wound up in jail. Nobody has been able to tell me exactly what happened, but best guess from what I've been told, one night, he got into a shouting match with his mother, which turned physical and his dad had to peel him off her until the cops showed up and arrested him, so I guess things got pretty bad so that one of the neighbors called the cops. I never would have expected this from him with anybody, much less his mom. If only he could have fought this hard for me way back when, things might be different.

So, as of this update, I'm sitting around with not much to do, but at least I'm not in jail. Sorry for any errors, I loaned my laptop to my friend's son and it hasn't worked properly since, though he claims he did nothing bad to it. He's a good kid, so I believe him that it was probably just an accident. Hope everyone is staying safe and doing as well as can be during this time. auf wiedersehen. -Mia

Thank you for your kind comments. the older lady on the plane was funny, when she sat down, she said ""shprecken zee english?"" (Intentionally misspelled to demonstrate how bad it was.) I hope things are well with her and she's able to get back to America eventually.

There is a restaurant in Munich I was looking forward to going to, but that's been put off for a while I guess.

I have no idea what his intention in going to the airport was. If he thought there might be a ""talk her out of going"" moment, or just to simply say goodbye. I asked my mother to save up all the letters and mail them to me in a few months just out of curiosity. Maybe I'll read them on my birthday (July 12) - yet another thing to think about and ponder for a while.

Thanks again for your kind words and stay safe out there.""

***Comment April 14, 2020:***

Thank you and I saw no problem with your english. I had been thinking of calling him while I was here, but his recent troubles have made me rethink it. I have no idea how you call someone currently in jail. If I am motivated enough, I might try it. He only mailed the letters to my parents' house in Iowa because he has no clue, other than Germany, where I am right now. I am hoping that when this virus thing blows over, I will return to America for a visit in 2 years and maybe I will feel comfortable by then to see him in person.

It's like he had a complete personality change and that's what mystifies me the most. He went from quiet and reserved to some sort of deviant maniac and now I wonder when at some time in our marriage (if it had gone through), he would have laid his hands on me, like he did with his mother.

To answer a previous question, I will be 33 in July and he will also be 33 in October.

I have been to a lot of European countries, but Spain has not been one of them. Maybe once I get established here, it will be easier for me to jet over and check it out.

Thank you again for your kind words. Stay safe during this current crisis.

[Post 1](https://www.rareddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/g49jsj/update_from_germany_i_talked_to_him/) **April 19 2020**

I actually spoke to him yesterday on the phone. when last I updated, he had been arrested and thrown in jail for assaulting his mother. I don't know if he's out on bail, or there were no charges, or what, but he has spent the last few days sittting in my parent's front yard, doing nothing but sitting. My dad said he was going to go out there and kick his ass, but my mom, who's definitely the cooler headed of the two, went out there and calmly told him I was gone and he should pick up and start his life over too. She called me and told me this, so I decided to call him, which I did last night. He answered and sounded kind of relieved it was me, but also sad. J=Jack (my ex), M=me (or Mia, either one works). This is the conversation to the best of my memory:

J: Hello

M: Hello, I understand you're out in my parent's front yard. Well, I'm not there, so please leave them alone.

J: I was hoping that the rumors I heard weren't true, that you were still here and we could talk.

M: I tried talking before and you just took it as a chance to grab my ass and act as if sex could solve this whole thing.

J: I'm sorry, I've never broken up before, so I'm not sure how to go about it.

M: I've never broken up before either, but I think I've handled it better. I just gotta know - why?

J: I have to do what my mother says, and she wasn't happy when she found out you couldn't have children.

M: You're 32, I don't think you have to do what your mother says anymore.

J: you just don't understand.

M: I do understand. We had discussed the problem before and had come up with solutions which apparently aren't satisfactory to her, so you threw our relationship away. Did it mean that little to you?

J: You didn't have to go away. When are you coming back?

M: Not for a couple of years. Once this whole pandemic thing is over, I can hopefully find a job and my own place to stay.

J: Come back, please.

M: I'm sorry, but you made your choice. Barbie (his mother) or me. I hope the two of you are quite happy together.

throughout all of this, he is crying, and I'm doing my best not to.

J: Please come back, we can get married and adopt or whatever. I'm sorry, we can find a way to work this out.

M: I told you there were always alternatives, but you threw those away along with me. Plus, Barbie's going around calling me defective and she won't accept us adopting, how does that change?

J: You're not defective. I'm sorry, but I can't control what she thinks.

M: No, but you support what she thinks. You've known this about me since we were 16, suddenly it's an issue.

J: I don't like her calling you defective. In case you hadn't heard, I just spent time in jail for defending you.

M: Maybe if you had done that when this all started, I'd still be there.

I think that broke him, because he kept quietly whispering ""sorry"" over and over and then hung up. I just laid on the bed and quietly cried until viktoria (my friend's oldest child) knocked quietly and told me it was time for dinner.

sorry for the formatting, still trying to get used to how reddit works. Also sorry if I came across as a bitch in this, but when someone throws away a relationship that goes back to childhood, I can be a bit upset. Hope everyone is staying safe through this whole pandemic thing and hopefully, when it's all over, I can get on with my life here in Germany

[Post 2](https://www.rareddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ghvfut/update_from_a_different_part_of_germany/) **May 11 2020**

Warning: there is talk of suicide in here, not me, just someone else in the story hinting at it

so, I moved out of my friend vanessa's this weekend. Her family was incredibly nice in taking me in, but when we first planned this, it was pre-virus, and I thought I'd have my own place and a job and everything. My uncle said he would drive down and pick me up and I felt better taking his offer than continuing down there. So, he came down Saturday, spent the night with some friends of his, and we drove back up to Kulmbach on Sunday, where I am currently staying with him and his wife and typing this out before bed.

It's weird being here, given I was born here and lived my first 9 years here, but even when I've been here on vacation in the past, it never felt as strange just being here. I don't know if it's the feeling of the town being deserted, or my current personal situation, it just doesn't feel right. Anyway, that's enough of miscellaneous rambling, I'm just trying to avoid typing the real part of this story if you couldn't tell.

Friday night, Jack (my ex) called me. I still have the same phone and the same account back in Iowa, so when it rang with his distinct ring tone, it caught me by surprise. I picked it up and said, ""Whaddya want?"", which I know was a bit rude and I apologized to him about it as soon as he said, ""I just wanted to see how you were doing and say hi"". So, we proceeded to have a pleasant conversation, when I could hear screeching and a ""is that her?"" followed by him saying ""I'm talking, leave me alone"" when she (Barbie, his mother who started all this) got on and said, ""Leave my son alone, haven't you done enough damage?"" To which I responded by simply hanging up. She must have gotten his phone and tried calling me a few more times, none of which I answered, but when I checked voice mails later, she was going off on how I ""ruined his life"", how he had lost his job (which we knew was going to happen anyway last year when the owner of his company announced his retirement and that he was selling off the assets, but he gave one year notice and even helped some employees find work elsewhere, he had lost his house (we sold our house after our breakup), he had been caught ""drinking in public"" (I guess he bought a few bottles, went down near the lake and drank in the park and got busted by the police for it, heard that from another friend earlier, and how he had attacked her (mentioned before, but I secretly hoped he would have decked her good before his dad intervened). She even got to use her favorite word, ""defective"", saying that if she had known 16 years ago that I was defective, she would have gotten her son a nice, normal girl to be with. She also mentioned that Jack had talked about suicide recently, saying there's no point in going on. i tried calling back, but every time, she picked up the phone and resumed her screaming, so I gave up trying and just wrote him a letter, which I sent to my parents for them to deliver to his house, figuring barbie would just see it was from me and intercept it if I sent it to him directly. I told him that I still loved him and wanted him to do well in life and move on, but that it was over between us.

So, here I am 5000 miles away, civilization shut down, living with my aunt and uncle and just waiting for when I can put my life back together. Thanks for reading, and sorry about any formatting errors. I think I'll put up my laptop now and go to sleep.","BestofRedditorUpdates",8220,8220,0,0.97,2,0,3,858
"https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/","catbulliesdog","2022-03-12",1647118671,"This is How the (Financial) World Ends","So, this week, we saw the start of the total collapse of the modern financial system and the end of the Bretton Woods era of international monetary policy.

Bold claim, yeah baby?  You're probably thinking this has to do with the war in Ukraine or something, right? Well, it does a little bit, but mostly it has to do with what happened with RSX and LME this week, and a little bit with what happened with Rivian.

**TLDR: Wall Street, China, and Russia are all broke and shit is going to get real over the next few months.  Or, to put it another way, some dude named Noah moved next door and started building a boat in his backyard, and you're just beginning to feel some raindrops.**

Let's start with the biggest shitshow out there, the London Metals Exchange, or LME.  A fair number of people are comparing what happened with LME and Nickel to what happened when Apex Clearing turned off the buy button for the meme stocks back in January of 2021.  And yes, I meant Apex Clearinghouse, not Robinhood you twits, Apex made RH do it, and a dozen other brokers as well.  Vlad was just a fall guy, and not the cool kind that was on TV back in the '80s.

What the LME did can be split into two parts: 

1) they had a massive short squeeze that was fucking up prices, amplified by uncertainty from the war in Ukraine, so they completely halted trading.  This is entirely normal.  It's happened dozens of times in the 144 years they've been open.  Complete trading halts occur in all exchanges whenever shit starts getting fucked up.  For example, US markets were shut down for a week after 9/11.

2) they fucking canceled 12 hours worth of completed trades.  This is the part that should get your knickers in a twist if you were actually wearing any.   

Now, I know a lot of you are sitting there feeling smart thinking ""I know why they did it! They're criminals and stealing!""  Well, you're right, but that's NOT why they canceled 12 hours of completed trades, just like Apex didn't turn off the meme buy button because they woke up and decided they really needed to use their broker apps to get their fuck on with retail in a big 'ol gang bang. 

No, they did this for one reason and one reason only: survival.  They were dead.  LME let the Nickel market get so fucked up that they not only had to stop transactions, or unwind a couple at the end, they had to unwind 12 fucking hours worth of trading.  I mean, these people are so goddamned incompetent that they didn't even realize they'd been shot in the head, skinned, and turned into a fucking rug for two whole shifts at Wendy's!

Understand, they just set 144 years of skimming trades on fire.  It's not little guys buying FDs on the LME, it's big boys and industrial giants.  They all have lawyers and elected officials on retainer, and all of those clients are as done and gone as your made up Canadian girlfriend from grade school.

I can't decide if the best part of all this is the cover story they put out, or how many dumbfucks didn't take three seconds to realize its bullshit.  The idea that Xiang Guangda just said ""I don't want to pay the margin call"" and then the LME was like, ""ok, well, I guess that sucks to be us, guess we'll just pour all this gasoline on ourselves and play with matches"" is so laughable I just got a hernia from ROFLing so hard.  Look, because I know you 'tards are all stuck on the shortbus trying to figure out what I'm talking about, I'll just drive ya'll on over to the explanation:

Tsingshan (the company Xiang owns that has the short position) isn't some kind of nickel producer like the papers are saying.  They make steel.  They're the second largest (largest by revenue) steel making company in China.  You know what that steel is used for?  Construction.  Know who hasn't had enough money to make a bond payment in over six months now?  Every goddamned construction company and developer in China.  What, you think they're paying their fucking materials bills?  

Here's a quote from the South China Morning Post attributed to Xiang:

 *Foreigners have some activities going on \[against Tsingshans position,\] we are actively coordinating \[to tackle the problem\], China Business News cited Xiang as saying in a report late on Tuesday. We have received a lot of phone calls today  related government departments and leaders are very supportive to us. Tsingshans position, operation and management has no problems.* 

Again, because I know you can't read, here's a translation of that quote into a picture.

[I specifically said there are no problems, so it's all okay!](https://preview.redd.it/e4shtzkzqwm81.jpg?width=1366&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5805dd8e45ccb467d0bc47a41d6107873f74d864)

Now, why is it such a huge problem that Xiang has no money?  Well, if he can't make the margin call, the short position, much like a politician or anyone who's daddy donated a library to get them into Harvard, fails upwards.  First it goes up to Xiang's bank, which is also fucking broke.  Then it moves onto the LME itself, which again, doesn't have the fucking money.  So what does the LME do?  Same thing the mobsters in Goodfellas did when the restaurant was too broke to steal from anymore, they set everything on fire.  The reason the LME hasn't opened back up yet is because the short position is still there, and nobody who's responsible for that position has the money to cover it.

Now, you might think, if you were smart instead of so dumb you went to Bangkok to get a TIE Fighter, why does this Xiang guy have such a large naked short position he can't cover?  The answer is simplicity itself - he's broke, so he naked shorted his own shit to get paid, then got fucked when it went sideways.  I mean, people here on WSB like to call themselves reckless degenerates, but lemme give you a full ""trust me bro"" on this one, ya'll ain't got shit on the stupid rich fucks that run the world.

That's part one.  What about part 2, RSX?  Well, as many people who lost money Friday can attest, some serious, serious fucking of Put options occurred.  Van Eck started to liquidate the RSX fund, but they didn't *say* they were liquidating it, so options couldn't settle as cash value.  But they ALSO halted trading of the ETF, so options couldn't be traded either.  And as a final piece of fuck you brokers weren't letting people borrow shares to even fucking exercise the put option themselves.  Wild yeah? (someone else wrote a very good DD on this exact thing this morning, I highly recommend you go read it - no link because automod hates me every time I put a link in my posts)

This is example number two of someone burning down the restaurant because they couldn't steal from it anymore.  Whatever MM sold those options didn't have enough to cover them, so this shit with Van Eck not stating the fund was liquidating happened.

That's strike two for all the market makers and exchanges being fucking broker than you when you've gotta go behind the Taco Bell because Wendy's is too high class for your ass.  Let's see if we can a third K to finish them off.

I give you Rivian, ticker RIVN, a truly shitty EV manufacturer, that like most of them can't actually make cars.  These guys are such a clown show that they tried to raise the prices on the pre-orders from the people who waited years to get one.  So they had earnings on 3/10, and it was just about as big of a disaster as you'd expect.  Then, after hours, they dropped $6 bucks on nearly a million in volume.  Everyone who bought puts printed, right?  Nope.  The next day in pre-market, on less than a third of that volume, the price magically shot back up $5.5 bucks, completely wiping out everyone's puts.  By EOD the price had only dropped a total of $3 bucks from Thursday's close, and wouldn't you know it, the price of an ATM put option bought EOD on 3/10 was more than $3. I'd recommend taking a look at the volume numbers and corresponding price movement of RIVN throughout the day on 3/11 and drawing your own conclusions.

This is like the, what, hundredth and a half time we've seen this exact thing play out now?  It's not an accident.  More money is traded every day in the market on options than stocks themselves.  When the PFOF brokers that retail uses publicly refer to the MMs as ""our clients"", you know the fix is in.  What makes the RIVN bit so interesting is a) how obvious it is, and b) that they're doing this while under DOJ investigation for this exact fucking thing.  That tells me two things, 1) they don't think they'll actually be prosecuted - which, fair, they've got a whole lot of history on their side for this one, and 2) they don't have a choice 'cause they're running out of money.

And why, you may ask are they out of money?  Well, it's a mix of things.  1) all the attention from Reddit and the media and law enforcement has clients pulling money from Hedge Funds, leading to sell offs, which when you're leveraged at 137x, leads to a rapid collapse in your buying power. 2)  Russian assets aren't just in freefall anymore, they've hit the ground and started drilling for oil.  3) remember where I was talking about China earlier?  Yeah, their shit is worth even less than the Russian stuff, but thanks to Xi's brilliant leadership plan, people haven't realized that yet.  Below, I have obtained exclusive photo evidence from some of my old SF buddies of Xi and his top councilor enacting their plan to save China's economy.

&amp;#x200B;

[If we can't see the lines go down, then are they really dropping?](https://preview.redd.it/r254e9n2rzm81.jpg?width=444&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5e60e42c8029878e089a05a5aac070b30ccae9e7)

As always, the official info coming out of China is a mix of fantasy, lies, and flat out ignorance, spiced up by a heaping helping of corrupt incompetence.  Because Xi is a tinpot wannabe dictator with delusions of Imperial grandeur, he wanted to make sure that while he was hosting the Olympics everything went off without a hitch, so he told all the companies and rich people in China to make like autists and buy the fucking dip in the equities and bond markets.

Because all those folks didn't want to get executed by anti-aircraft guns while their families went to the organ donor farms, they did.  Which in this case, means throwing good money after very very very bad money.  It's honestly difficult to describe just how badly China has sabotaged itself.  I'm sure you all know by now about the ghost cities made up of structurally unsound buildings with no interiors, and in some cases no exterior walls.  But, do you also know about all the railways to nowhere that aren't being serviced or maintained?  Do you also know how many MORE shitty tofu-dreg buildings have been paid for by citizens' life savings that aren't yet built?  Spoiler, it's a lot.

Meanwhile, the property market in China is in free fall.  Here's a chart of official chinese statistics on the price of housing.

&amp;#x200B;

[Taken directly from the National Bureau of Statistics of China](https://preview.redd.it/dskl8tmog0n81.png?width=730&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ec62bd2b0c5e9f8e65ff80d4d03fc30a2d2b70c1)

Now, these prices all reflect worthless tofu-dreg empty apartments that exist only to sell to the next sucker/investor.  Notice that trend line?  Anyone know what happens when that price increase gets closer to zero?  As our friend Lelu from the 5th Element would say ""bada bing boom!"".  For another reference, look at the Dutch tulip market after it popped.  Remember, these are the official Chinese govt numbers.  I'm guessing the actual numbers have gone negative already.

Western banks, particularly up in Canada, are extremely exposed to the bonds these empty shell apartments are backing.  Western banks, again particularly up in Canada, are also heavily exposed to the commercial and residential real estate markets.  Both of which are in massive fucking bubbles funded in large part by money from Wall Street, Russia, and China.  Guess which of those are now broke (hint: it's all three of them).  CMBS notes started going bad this month - there's a reason all the politicians all of a sudden decided we needed to be back in the office, and the mortgage missed payment rate is skyrocketing faster than the price of oil.  I have not yet been able to figure out if the spike in missed mortgage payments is banks/wall street failing to pay on all the properties they've accumulated, if it's all the missing repossessions from the pandemic finally showing up, or if it's a leading indicator of a new crisis.

I don't know how much longer the powers-that-be can keep these balls in the air, but it's not much longer.  Assuming Russia follows their playbook from the disaster they had in Grozny in '94/'95, we're about to see the major cities in Ukraine get leveled by heavy artillery and rocket attacks.  Which means you can pretty much kiss the Ukrainian wheat harvest goodbye, because all the infrastructure needed to support it will be rubble, along with the roads and bridges you'd need to get it out of the country.  Couple that with what looks to be bad wheat harvests in the US and China barring some big weather pattern shifts, and we're going to see some massive price spikes in the price of bread and other food this summer.  Expensive food = political instability and riots.

The US will see a fresh round of ""race riots"" sparked by random online videos that are really about inflation and economic inequality, but the media and politicians will go full hog on the race angle, and people will buy it - if you need proof the general population is that gullible, look at how many think the Ukraine war is responsible for inflation and gas prices.  South Africa and Turkey, plus an unkown number of Middle Eastern countries will see Syrian civil war/Arab Spring type uprisings - remember, the Tunisian revolt started as a protest about the price of bread.

Finally, since this is already way, way, way too long for any of you to actually read through, much less comprehend, I'll cut the part about Bretton Woods and the dollar as the international currency super short - there used to be one global financial system that was set up after WWII in a conference at Bretton Woods, hence the name.  By kicking Russia out of it, we forced the creation of a competing global economic system.  Which will likely be headed by China.  That pretty much guarantees another world war down the road, but hopefully not for a decade or two if we're really lucky.

Because I know my people, here are some tickers to throw money at if you want, I have extremely tiny positions (like one share in a couple of these) in all of them: long WEAT, SOYB, CORN, USO, YANG, short TUR, short EZA, short SPY/QQQ/DOW, long GME.  Oh, and I also just bought a Lincoln, because in addition to chips, the automakers are about to be short on metals too, and somehow a car counts as a fucking growth investment these days.

If I had the money to do so, I'd also buy farmland with wind turbines and/or solar on it.  Real assets are about to be king, especially food and energy, which are the definition of real assets with inelastic demand.

I'll be honest, the vast majority of my portfolio - over 90%, is in direct registered shares of GME, with a couple shares of AMC because fuck 'em, that's why.  I think at least a couple of brokers are going to detonate like we're seeing with the LME and fuckery like what happened with RSX will become more regular.  Whenever I have a big gain, I pull most of it out and buy more memes and then DRS them.

We grew up in the south, so me being gay wasn't exactly an option at the time. We started dating because it was a good cover for me, and she had a thing for me. I've never had much of a sex drive. I used to assume it was the pent up gay, but knowing the terms now, I'm probably on the ace spectrum. I definitely like men, but even with the hottest guys I only ever wanted it once or twice a month. 

I came out about 15 years ago, just to her. She was heartbroken, but very accepting. She asked me to still ""date"" her until I found a boyfriend, and I agreed because I did really value her as a close friend. We both agreed we would keep living together, go out together with friends, the usual, but obviously would start actively seeing other people. I met a few guys, but none that I really wanted to hold down, and she was happy enough coming home to me after whatever escapades she got up to. 

Then she got pregnant. Everyone assumed I was the father, and all I've ever wanted was to be a stay at home dad. I sat her down and told her that if she wanted, I'd marry her if she was the breadwinner. I'd take care of the baby, the house, all that stuff, if she supported us. I explained that I would want the same arrangement we had now, but that this way she could count on having childcare, and I would have the life I've always wanted. 

She agreed, and we got married in August 2011. ""Our"" daughter was born January of 2012. Life was exactly what I wanted and expected. We didn't have tons of money, but we got by fine. 

About 5 years ago, we got drunk, and slept together. For the first time in our relationship, we were actually physical. I woke up the next morning and was shocked at how much I didn't regret it. It was definitely not something I would have done sober, but it made her so happy it just made me happy. It was... Fine. Ultimately, it wasn't some horrid, gross thing. I wasn't into it, but it really made her happy, and that made me happy. 

She asked me about it, and I told her the truth. I am gay, I am not attracted to her, but I *do* love her. If a physical relationship would make her that happy, I could do that. After all, how many women are with men they aren't attracted to? 

When the pandemic hit, we had another talk. We discussed that seeing other partners wasn't safe, and for the time being, and the safety of our daughter, we should stop doing so. 

*Our* second daughter was born 3 days ago. There were some complications, and I realized I didn't just love my wife, I was *in* love with her. 

I have a perfect wife, a perfect little white picket fence life, and two beautiful daughters. I am a gay man, and I am in love with my wife.","offmychest",7369,7369,0,0.97,19,0,3,332

They would almost always force me to babysit Cora. Oftentimes they would promise I could go see my friends or do something, then I would be forced to cancel last minute because they wanted to go out and needed someone to watch Cora.

When they did spend time with Cora, I was almost always excluded. An example was how I was told to check in on my grandma (which I didnt mind, as I love her) and help her with chores.

I discovered after returning home that my dad, Lauren, and Cora went to an amusement park without me. Lauren claimed she wanted family-only on the trip. My dad did not say anything. This is one of the countless examples when I was excluded and my dad never stood up for me.

At 16, I chose to live with my mom full-time and stop coming to my dad and Laurens house. Things are going well. I have a job and am able to stay in the area because my college is online. (Not because of the pandemic-I chose an online program before any of that happened.)

I and a few of my friends were out for dinner when we bumped into Jacob, who was the son of two of my dads friends. He and his parents were always nice to me, so we spent most of dinner talking together. Jacob brought up that he was sad that he didnt get to see me as often after the courts had forced me away from my dads home.

It turns out my dad and Lauren told people how my evul mudder (ridiculous, but also Jacob never met my mom and only knew her from my dad's stories) manipulated the courts and had their custody completely stolen and thats why I didnt live with them anymore.

I told Jacob I chose to leave. I named some of the times I was excluded; How Lauren wanted family-only time without me and my dad never stood up for me. Jacob was shocked, but we managed to re-direct the conversation and it was still a good night.

It turns out Jacob told his parents, who told their friend group (including almost all the neighbors) about how my dad and Lauren treated me. Now their friends are excluding my dad and Lauren. They found a new phone to get past me blocking them, and are saying I need to talk about this with them and We know youre a good daughter and will help end these rumors about your family.

Some relatives are saying I should help them since now Cora is being excluded by her former friends and is extremely upset about it. These relatives are saying that Im an adult and Cora is a child so she should come first. I agree with putting children first, and I feel bad for Cora since it isnt her fault. But I still feel shes not my responsibility. AITA?","AmItheAsshole",7132,7132,0,0.97,5,1,0,763

Myself (33F) and my husband (38) have a 3 month old daughter. My stepmother is strictly prohibited from approaching me and my baby, and consequently my father refuses to see his granddaughter without his wife.

For context: my stepmother had a clandestine abortion in her youth, and had severe complications, which left her infertile. When she married my father, she immediately came to see me and my siblings as her children, being very pushy and invasive, and wanting to outdo our mother, who is alive and present in our lives. Even when we were kids, the situation made us uncomfortable, and her obsession with motherhood and being our ONLY mother scared us and drove us away completely. My father, wanting her to be happy, started trying to force us to call her Mommy. Eventually, our mom got our custody, and we moved across the country.

Over the years, and the physical distance, my relationship with them became more tolerable. There were occasional problems, such as the fact that she wanted to be mentioned as a mother in the wedding invitations, or when she tried to adopt my niece after my sister-in-law's death, declaring that my brother was unable to raise his daughter. Before the pandemic, she and my father moved to my state, something common for retirees. 

She started posting photos of my ultrasounds and baby clothes with captions like ""Looking forward to my baby's arrival"", or ""At last entering the journey of motherhood"". I scolded her, and demanded that she delete the posts. And then the physical harassment began. As we live in the same condominium, she started to come to my house several times a day to ""check"" me, fight with me about what I ate, and set up a complete nursery in her house, telling me that the baby would need to spend the first few days with someone more experienced to take care of him. When we found out it was a girl, she immediately started saying that finally her ""Cristina"" would come, and how her dream would finally come true. I immediately denied that this would be my daughter's name, and made it clear that she would not be a mother figure to my baby. My stepmother then reminded me that a lot can happen during childbirth, and that it was better that my SO and I understood that she and my father were prepared for any eventuality. And that I couldn't be cruel, and deny her the closest thing she'd ever have to a daughter, since I didn't accept being her daughter. After that, and other comments and actions, my husband and I decided to take some action in case she tried something. And now, three months after my baby was born, my father refuses to visit his granddaughter, even though we live close together, as I don't allow his wife to play mother and daughter with her. I understand that she has frustrated maternal instincts, but my daughter is not her replacement baby. So Redit, am I wrong?

*There are some comments which could help to fill some gaps. Thank you for your suggestion [u/frontal_robotomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/tnzlgl/aita_for_not_letting_my_stepmother_meet_my/i24dpxu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3):*

*USER: NTA. Trust your parental instincts. You're not obligated to humor her, your father is capable of making his own decisions.*

OOP: Thanks. Her attitude makes me very uncomfortable, and my husband is also worried. My dad says she's just very motherly, and that it's only natural for her to want to become close to the children in the family since she was never able to be a mother. I adore him, but he accuses me of being insensitive, and denying my daughter the love of an ""extra mother


*USER: NTA best advice move away from her she doesnt care about you and its clear from the interactions that she has manipulative ways of trying to undermine your choice* 

OOP: She was always like that. I think she resents the fact that my two brothers and I never accepted her as our new and only mother, and that we preferred to live with our birth mother away from her and my father. She tried to get a surrogate through an agency, but apparently they realized she wasn't very mentally stable.


*USER: NTA. Your stepmother is wayyy over the line and her obsession with your child and supposed motherhood over it is frankly creepy. If she cannot respect your boundaries then she does not need to have a role in your childs life.*

OOP: My brother said the same thing. He refuses to have contact with her and my father since she tried to usurp my niece when he became a widower. She and my father used the excuse that they wanted to help my brother, who was in mourning, and ended up not wanting to return the child. There was even a need for police involvement and a court order to recover my niece, who was four at the time.

*USER: So, your father was complicit in basically kidnapping your brother's daughter?*

OOP: Yes.


*USER: NTA. Honestly, she sounds crazy. Like grab your baby in the middle of the night and run off crazy. Why didnt she adopt or foster if she wanted kids that bad? You shouldnt let her anywhere near yall without some serious therapy. And never around the baby without you or your husband being present the entire time. I know your dad wants to make his wife happy but hes an AH here. Hes majorly enabling her and not thinking about anyone else.*

OOP: My stepmother has certain... principles regarding heredity, and therefore refuses to adopt a child ""she doesn't know where she comes from"". She's already tried to get a surrogate, but the staff at the agency she sought to broker the process didn't think she was stable enough, mentally speaking. Since then, she has focused all her energy on being not a grandmother, but a mother to my nephews and nieces. But my older brother is NC with her and my dad, and my other brother lives on another continent with his family. I am her only option. Regarding therapy, my father even tried to get her to go, but she refuses to go to a ""crazy doctor"".


*USER: JFC. The agency was right on the money with her. Has she tried to come over uninvited or anything since the baby was born? Or been harassing at all?*

OOP: She tried to make a few visits, and the last time my husband found her hanging around our garden, trying to find the nursery window. After that, we changed the fence and gate, as she had made a copy of the key to the old one. She called several times, including when I was still in the hospital, crying and saying that I was cruel and sadistic, for taking away her chance to take care of her little girl, and that all she wanted was the love and joy that only a mother can feel.

*USER: Definitely NTA. Does your father and stepmother have custody of your niece? I wouldn't want someone that unstable around me and my kids either. She needs therapy.*

OOP: No, they didn't get custody of my niece. In fact, my brother only recently came back to talk to our father, and my niece talks to him by video call, but they don't come to visit in person.

**Update 1**: My husband and I hardly slept that night. Partly because we've been reading your answers, and partly because a 3-month-old baby sleeps as little and breastfeeds as much as possible. Thanks to you, I was able to see that my father will never protect his children, especially if it means putting limits on my stepmother. But the big point, the straw who broke the camel's back, was what happened this morning. As I work from home, and my husband owns his own company, we decided to streamline the moving process. What was our surprise to find my stepmother in tears at our gate (properly locked), screaming and begging for my forgiveness, and claiming that all she wanted was love, happiness, and that I have no right to deny anything so small to her. For me, it was like coming out of shock. After threatening to call the police, my father finally came and took his wife home. Immediately I called my stepfather, and he and my mother came to pick us up. I was glad he came as he is a very intimidating man as well as being a retired police officer. We've packed a few essentials, and the three of us will be staying at my mom's house for now. She lives in an apartment, with plenty of space and three levels of security to allow access. We are in contact with our attorney, who will refer us to someone who specializes in family status, and we will seek to get a restraining order under our old address.
P.s: To someone who asked me in private: my sister-in-law's death was caused, according to the police report, by an alleged mechanical failure in her car. At the time, with the whole situation going on with my brother and niece, I never really went into the matter. And for the other person who asked, my mother is Chilean, but she has lived in the United States since she was 20 years old. She is an American citizen legally speaking, whereas my stepfather, father and stepmother are all North American by birth. I have dual nationality.

-/-

**UPDATE 2**: Well, it's been two weeks since my original post, and I felt compelled to let you know, who supported and advised me so much. A lot happened, but I will try to summarize. We blocked my dad and stepmother from phones and social media. Unfortunately, this only made the situation worse. My stepmother began to speak ill of me to anyone who would listen: our neighbors, friends, family members, and even our church priest. The last few days have been a campaign, but thank God people were able to see her insanity, and she ended up losing a lot of important people.
We put our house up for sale, and we are currently in the process of purchasing an apartment in my mother's building. Enhanced security is an attraction, in addition to the fact that items such as fingerprints are required for access. The garage also requires an access code, and this makes the building very secure. Following recommendations, we've taken our cars for a review, and we're in the process of getting a restraining order, based on the evidence we already have, such as audio and video of my stepmother's behavior. I completely cut off contact with my father, and my brothers did the same.
As for the possibility of my stepmother calling the CPS, when my husband went to get the rest of our belongings, five days ago, along with my brothers-in-law and father-in-law, my stepmother said that stealing her baby would not go unpunished, and that she would show it to everyone world that the two of us weren't good parents, and that we were prepared, because she wouldn't give up her baby. According to my father-in-law, her expression and speech caught the attention of the neighbors, and some of them assured my husband that they supported us, including noting her rapid and dangerous mental decline . The fact that my father did nothing to stop this episode ended up sealing the end of our relationship.
And so, this is the update so far. My mother and I only walked along the shore accompanied by my stepfather, who is now constantly armed, and he assured me that he would end my stepmother's existence before she steals his granddaughter.
I still can't sleep properly, and I'm paranoid about the baby monitor, doors and windows, even though my mom lives on the fifteenth floor. Because of this, I am actively seeking a therapist, and my husband and I are closer and closer than ever. We review all the legal issues regarding our wills, and the custody not only of our little girl, but also of any baby we have in the future.

For now, that's it. Thank you all for your support, advice, criticism and immense help. I promise to inform you of any news.

I type this with a weight lifted from my shoulders and my baby boy sleeping in my arms. My fight is over. 

Recap: Work was trying to force me back into the office immediately upon returning from maternity leave after being remote for over 2 yrs due to pandemic. I fought, saying there's no reason to be physically in. We perform best at home, as they've said countless times. They came back later lowering the number of days. Didn't matter. Not going in, not able, willing, or comfortable with it. Maybe a little petty, but hell I had nothing to lose. Maybe I could help things change.
Found out they made exceptions and were backtracking on that. Saw they posted my position online as open the same day I returned, before I first objected. I was pissed. 

Well, I gave it all some serious thought over the weekend on what to do. Can't back down now right? If I said okay, what was the point of my fuss. Fuck it. Husband supports me and is also living vicariously through this lol.
I replied this morning to my boss' boss last email with something almost word for word a comment said. (Thanks guys! I swear I read almost every single one.) 

Emails below: 

Me:
Morning,
I apologize for the delay.
I hope you understand that I have not offered, nor will I offer, my resignation. You cannot accept something that was never offered. I am more than able to work remotely as I have been. I will continue to do so until such time as you determine firing me and losing a valuable employee is the better option.
You of course have the right to terminate our relationship and my employment, but to be clear- this is not in any way voluntary on my part.
-OP 

 .... 

About an hour later, I got a call from my boss' boss and HR. NOT answering that shit! I want my paper trail. They constantly say stupid things over the phone and my mind goes blank. I know my limits. She called 3 times! I messaged them saying I'd prefer to keep this over email due to the sensitive nature of our conversation. She replied, ""you have to answer the call"". I ignored another call. I said, ""If you're going to fire me, I'd prefer you just say so."" 

20 minutes go by... 

Boss' boss:
Your refusal to return to work one day a week and answer my calls today has brought us to the point where we will accept your resignation.  We will pay you through the end of the day today, any unused vacation is forfeited.  Your benefits terminate at midnight tonight.   Contact HR regarding any questions about your health insurance and or other benefits. 

... 

Me:
While we can agree to disagree about the need to be in the office, I think it would have been crazy to answer your call this morning considering previous conversations over the phone in the past. Thank you for keeping this over email. You continue to use that word, resignation. I dont think you understand what that means&
It was a pleasure. Good fucking luck. 

My access was cut. Don't worry, I have copies of all of it. All of my coworkers texted me saying there was a meeting immediately after with the entire department. They were told that none of them are being replaced. I resigned. Management posted my job last Tuesday (lie) because I said that day I was not coming back. They already got 63 resumes and brought seven people in for interviews so far (lie). She doesn't think it will be hard to fill the spot (sure, but turnover) but she wanted them to know that none of their jobs are in jeopardy and that I decided not to come back. Wow.  

My coworkers are all pissed. Some are looking elsewhere for employment, some are asking for raises, and others are just quietly doing the bare minimum. Oh yeah, and I still had over 200 emails that needed my attention and over 1000 items in my queue. Sure, they'll find someone lol. 

So there's the end of my saga. 

Thanks for all the support! I will be enjoying my time off with my smiley baby, and maybe slowly start applying or see what unemployment says cuz why the hell not right. We'll be okay for a while. (Not why I did this. I was trying to fight for what I believed in. Well aware of the consequences). Lucky as hell to be in the position I am. Husband is so supportive. He brought our little man over to me after I closed my laptop for the last time, bouncing, singing ""mama's got her baby! Mama's with her baby!"" Ugh, my heart! 

Some of you suggested I reach out to an employment lawyer. I think I will. Not sure I have anything, but it doesn't look good on them either way and again, I know my limits. I don't know law. 

Tldr: new mom, 3 months postpartum. First day back to work 6/13. Remote since pandemic, only hired 2 months before that. Top performer on team. Not planning on going into office. Told it's ""policy"" and they'll accept my resignation. Back and forth a bit. They said I ""resigned"". Smh

[**Original Post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gr3wfy/aita_for_not_wanting_to_name_my_unborn_daughter/) \- 26 May 2020

My husband (35) and I (31) are about to be first-time-parents as Im currently 35 weeks pregnant. We found out it was a girl and my husband suggested the name Tiffany. I immediately fell in love with the name! I asked him where he got it from and he told me that he heard it while watching a movie and it stuck with him. I didnt think much of it. We decided that we both loved the name and that it was going to be our little girls name!

However, a few days ago, my SIL and I were talking (on FT) and we got onto the topic of the name. She mentioned how surprised she was that I agreed to that name because shed never want to name her child after her husband's high school girlfriend. I was really confused at first and asked her what the heck she meant. She told me that my husband dated a girl named Tiffany from 10th grade until they were juniors in college. While I knew my husband had a long relationship in high school and college, I never knew the girl's name.

My SIL could tell how upset I was and assumed that my husband told me where he got the name from. I told her that he told me that he heard it from a movie and he never mentioned it was his ex-girlfriend's name. She apologized and told me that she didnt mean to upset me. I wasnt upset with her, though. I was and still am so angry at my husband.

After hanging up, I confronted my husband and asked him if what his sister said is true. He tried to blow it off at first but eventually admitted that its true. We argued back and forth for a while before I told him that I would NOT name my daughter after his ex-girlfriend and I refused to use the name Tiffany anymore.

He tried to convince me that it wasnt a big deal but IT IS to me because 1) he lied to me about where the name came from, 2) I dont want to look at my daughter every day and remember that shes named after my husbands ex-girlfriend, and 3) it makes me feel like he still loves her... as far as I know, theyre not in contact and havent been since they broke up.

He told me that I was overreacting, acting like a child and that I cant change my mind now since Im due in 5 weeks. I feel hurt and betrayed.

AITA for not wanting to name my daughter after my husbands ex-girlfriend?

Edit: after I finally got him to admit the truth, I asked him why he wanted to use that name in the first place and he told me because he thought it was pretty and that his ex-girlfriend was such a good person that he wanted to name our daughter after her but thought that I wouldnt agree to it (which I dont!), so he told me that he heard it from a movie instead of being honest.

Edit #2: I just wanted to thank everyone so much for the support. Reading through your comments has really helped me realize that Im not going to be manipulated into naming my daughter anything but what feels right to me. My husband slept over at his parents guesthouse last night (because the quarantine; he didnt go near his parents, dont worry) because I felt like I needed some time away from him. Im going to talk to him when he gets home today, though. Ill update everyone once weve had a chance to talk and let you all know what ends up happening. In the meantime, I posted on NameNerds to get some ideas for new names! Im really excited to look into names, so if youd like to suggest any names, you can find my post on my profile. Id love any and all suggestions. :)

[Top Comment Ruling: NTA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gr3wfy/comment/frwik3a/)

***Redditor:*** *If he thought it wouldn't be an issue that it was his ex girlfriend's name, he wouldn't have lied about it, plain and simple. He deceived you into agreeing to the name, he continued to lie to you when you confronted him, and now he's trying to force you to keep the name with ridiculous logic (you can't change your mind 5 weeks before giving birth? What kind of bs is that?). Even if you would have been okay with the name originally had he been honest, now it's tainted by the fact that he lied to you about it.*

*Is he usually like this?*

***OP:*** *I would normally say hes not usually like this at all, but now that Im thinking about it... he has been acting weird for the past few months and has been kind of distant. I have no idea what to do at this point. I feel completely clueless and lost.*

[Thread where OP identifies what she needs now](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/gr3wfy/comment/frwwdg4/)

***Redditor:*** *You understand the alternative is saying, ""Oh well, let's just forget this forever then, agree to disagree"" though, right? Check if it's the hill you need to die on.*

***OP:*** *I definitely wont forget that this happened and I think that its important that we do attend some kind of counseling. Im just not sure how I can get him to go. And Im due in 5 weeks, or she could come earlier, and with the quarantine... Im not even sure when we could go to counseling but I dont want to put this off, either. I feel way too betrayed to just let this go.*

I originally posted this in r/relationship_advice but it was removed for some reason. So, I cant respond to anyone in the comments. However, Ive been reading through all the comments and theyve really helped me a lot. If anyone else would like to offer advice, Id appreciate it a lot. For now, Ive decided that Im going to take the time I need to think about everything before making a decision on what to do. Again, all advice is appreciated and welcomed. Thank you so much.

I recently posted on AITA asking if I was the asshole for not wanting to name my unborn daughter after my husband's ex-girlfriend. Basically, my husband suggested the name Tiffany for our daughter without telling me that its the name of his ex-girlfriend. Instead, he told me it was from a movie. I eventually found out that its his ex-girlfriend's name and decided that I wont name my daughter Tiffany. My husband called me childish and told me that I couldnt change my mind so close to the due date (5 weeks away!).

A lot of people have mentioned that he might be cheating on me with his ex-girlfriend or he still has feelings for her. Ive thought about it a lot and based on how hes been acting the past few months, they might have a point. So, when my husband got back from spending the night at his parents' guesthouse (he had no contact with his parents), I demanded that we have a serious talk.

It was pointless at first. I basically just kept repeating the same thing over and over again as he refused to comment on anything I said. Finally, I asked him if he was cheating on me. He immediately denied it. But I didnt believe him. I continued to pester him about it and he finally admitted that hes been texting his ex-girlfriend for a little bit, but thats it. Again, there was no way I was going to believe him. I asked him how long theyve been in contact. He told me not long. But I wanted a real answer, so I asked again. He told me for a few months.

Basically, from what he told me, he was in contact with her for a few days before we found out it was a girl and thats why he suggested the name Tiffany to me. We found out it was a girl at 22 weeks, and Im now 35 weeks pregnant. So, hes been talking to her for about 13 weeks behind my back.

I basically just cried and kept asking him questions to get as much information about it as I could. He kept trying to avoid each question but I finally got answers out of him.

He told me that she contacted him because she was getting married and was having second thoughts. My husband admitted to me that talking to her made him realize that he never stopped having feelings for her but that he loves me, too. And the reason he suggested the name Tiffany to me was because he knew he couldnt leave me to be with her, so he wanted something to honor her with, which doesnt make sense because it sounds like shes fucking dead when she isnt.

I made him show me the messages and they were flirty with hearts and winks but nothing was sexual. From what he told me, his ex went through with getting married and they both knew they couldnt be together again but they enjoy talking with each other.

We both ended up crying and he kept begging me not to leave him but... its wrong, its so wrong. I dont know what to do. Im lost. Completely. I tried to get him to leave for a few days and go back to his parents' guesthouse but he refused. Now Im sleeping in the guest bedroom, which only has a twin bed because hes refusing to sleep anywhere but the master bedroom because he wants us to go back to normal.

I just... I feel like my entire world has collapsed. And I know people will tell me to leave him or divorce him but Im 5 weeks away from giving birth to our daughter... and with the pandemic happening... I dont know what to do. I need help. The stress and emotional pain is making my stomach and back ache and I feel like Im going to throw up. I feel so, so, so hurt and confused and betrayed.

What should I do? Please help.

I apologize if this post is all over the place, Im just way too upset to actually care. If I left out important information or if you have questions, Ill answer anything. I just need advice and guidance.

This all took place before and during the pandemic. I will be reframing from names for anonymity.

I (23m), my best friend (21m), and his wife (21f) have knew each other since middle school. We have always been friends, i was always kind of a third wheel, But i was always pretty Ok with that really.

I was a couple years older than them, and as such went to college sooner and got a good paying job in a city near our home town. Eventually they fallowed looking for work, and to settle down in a better area because they had an unexpected pregnancy.

They got themselves a nice little apartment and were getting settled in, when my BFs dad called him to tell him he found him a job that would pay 50k for three months of labor, the catch being he had to be on site out in the boonies of Montana. Well, his wife was 7 months pregnant at that time, but its not like they could reasonably pass up such an opportunity. She insisted that he go do the job, and that shed be fine, as long as he could send money home.

When he left i went to see him off. He told me to take care of her, and the baby when it came. I said i would. And i did. Id take her to doctors appointments, go out for coffee, sometimes just hang out. I should clarify that i was the only person she knew in this new city, and she was absolutely stressing more than she thought she was going to. Not knowing anyone, her husband being gone, the baby, etc.

Then, he died. It was an accident. It was quick and painful. We were both absolutely heart broken, the kind of ""ball your eyes out once a day in the shower for a few months"" kind of heart broken. Without the money he was sending home she couldn't afford to live in her current apartment, and going back to her old town wasn't an option for a few reasons, so I offered to let her live with me, along with the soon newborn. It wasn't two weeks after his death was the baby born, no complications, perfectly healthy. A girl.

They had a solid nest egg of cash saved up, so she wasn't destitute after his passing, but it wouldn't last long. Nevertheless she was looking into welfare programs and anything she could to get a place for herself to get out of my hair. Then: pandemic.

With everything shutdown she didn't have much of an option but to stay with me. I genuinely didn't mind though. She always was thanking me and apologizing when the baby cried late at night, but i really didn't care. I was helping my life long friends, and my best friends kid out. I actually really looked forward to babysitting for them before all of this, and in a weird way, that baby girl was all either of us had left of him.

But things changed. 2 weeks became months. Greif went from a knife to the heart to an aching scar. the baby girl grew. I would sometimes visit his grave, sometimes accompanied with his widow.

I cant really say when our relationship went from good supportive friends, to me supporting them and acting as a father. When we started sleeping together would probably be a good start though. About 6 months after his death we got a baby sitter a few floors down and had a day in. A lot of places were still closed in our city, and we both just wanted to decompress for a night. We had a fair deal of alcohol in our system, one thing led to another, and we woke in the same bed the next morning. We really didn't intend on that. We really really didn't. We both felt terribly guilty afterwards.

But that doesn't mean we stopped. That was a year and a half ago about? We have been acting as a couple officially for a year now. We still think about her late husband. We both sometimes go to his grave. I just don't know how to interpret the situation.

Did i betray my friend, stealing his wife and daughter? Or did i carry out his last orders to the letter, and simply took care of them? I wish i could summon him from the dead and have an honest conversation about it, we had always been very open with each other about how we felt about things and each other, I'm sure he would voice his concerns on a mature and reasonable way. Even if he said i was an evil snake i would want to hear it, just to know. I just want what's best for now my SO, and now my daughter. And i absolutely do love both of them. I just hope he wouldn't see this as a betrayal.","TrueOffMyChest",6667,6667,0,0.94,28,1,1,616

[**ORIGINAL POST**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/x4tlhf/parents_booted_me_out_at_18_and_left_me_homeless/) - September 2022

This is a rant story. And I just need a place to vent this. I don't want to reveal any details that would get me recognized. Especially by my parents if they happen to be on Reddit. So please, no one ask for any details I don't already provide in this post.

I'm 30-male, and my parents didn't really want kids. I was an only child, and pretty much an accidental pregnancy from what relatives have told me as my parents claimed that they were going to be child-free when they married. My childhood was initially good. But I think after I started growing out of the cute and adorable phase, my parents were less inclined to spend time with me. They both worked, and had their own business that they started together. That business was their life, and I was ALWAYS second fiddle to it! Any other close members of family like my grandparents lived states away, and I barely knew anything about them till I was an adult. So I had no other family around my entire childhood. I was practically raised by TV and my school teachers.

My own birthdays by the time I became a teenager were often spent without my parents as they'd just give me some money and tell me to go out and buy whatever I wanted. It was more or less the same with Christmas, and sometimes even back to school shopping. We wouldn't have even had a Christmas tree after I turned 10 if it weren't for the fact I convinced my parents to buy a fake one I could build up and then take apart later every year. If I were to describe my parents. Think of them as those people who always wear black, drink lots of wine, and look down their noses at people. And the last I saw of my parents, they still looked and acted the same way. Although my father was always wearing a toupée now.

When I turned 16 I asked my parents if I could work part time for them at their business. And they just told me they had no open positions or anything like that. They may as well have just come right out and said they didn't want me there. After I turned 18 my parents told me that since I was an adult, they expected me to move out as soon as I was able. I was working part time because I was still in high school. And I didn't have anywhere near enough saved for college. And not long after high school ended my parents told me to pack up and move out. They got an official eviction notice that gave me 30 days and everything. They didn't even help me move. I had to get help from a friend's dad who owns a truck.

I ended up renting a crappy apartment and working retail. I had no real life experience and no time for college. Then after just a few months I got fired because my manager legitimately had it out for me and wrote me up for the stupidest things. I don't even remember what they were anymore. But I wasn't the only one the manager treated that way. I called corporate about it and so did a few other people. Corporate looked into the manager, and they were soon fired for various reasons. Not many of which I actually know since it was mostly kept quiet. But someone told me theft of cigarettes was a part of it. And the manager was a chain smoker. Corporate refused to rehire me and only said that they'd change the record to say I was laid off instead of terminated so my resume would still be clean. Guess they considered me damaged goods or something.

I ended up going broke pretty fast because I was terrible at managing my own money and couldn't find steady employment. So I lost my apartment. I went back to my parents begging for help, but they refused to take me in. Not even for a little while to get back on my feet. I ended up homeless and living out of a tent in someone's back yard, in winter. My friends had all moved on to college, some in other states, and I was a broke kid taking whatever work I could to stay alive.

My salvation came when one of the neighbors of my parents found out I was living out of a tent and offered to take me in for a little while so I wouldn't freeze. She helped me badger my parents into telling me how to get in touch with the other members of my estranged family. My parents did not want to say. My guess is out of fear of being judged for throwing their son out the way they did. But they coughed up the info and gave me a list of contact details. And then told me not to bother them ever again.

I called my grandparents from my father's side of the family, and they were very surprised and happy to hear from me because they hadn't seen me since I was an infant. And I'm their only grandchild. My grandparents after finding out my situation, flew me over to live with them as soon as they could. They basically adopted me. My parents didn't even see me off at the airport despite being invited to. I had zero contact with them for pretty much a decade.

My grandparents said they despised my parents for treating me so poorly, and legally disowned them by striking them from their wills. My parents I'm told were not happy to hear that. But also said it didn't really matter because they were plenty well off and didn't need anything from my grandparents. How wrong that statement turned out to be.

After about a year of living with my grandparents I was able to afford to start going to community college. I got an associates degree, got a decent job thanks to a recommendation from my grandpa, and eventually my grandparents offered to sell me their house so they could retire to Arizona. My grandma wanted to live in a warmer climate as the cold winter was getting harder and harder on her health every year. I was sad to see them go. But I happily bought the house. They sold it to me for one-third it's value. And I'll have it paid off in a few more years. My job has me going away on the road periodically. So I can end up away from home for weeks at a time. Not that I mind the travel. I have no pets or a girlfriend, or anything like that. I wouldn't have time for them right now. But in a few years when I have some things in order I'll make time. I don't want to stay a lonely bachelor forever.

Then one day in late 2020 I came home after being away for over two weeks, only to find a large white van I did not recognize in my driveway. I was getting ready to call police when I noticed the van had the logo from my parents' business on the side of it. And I felt dread. Yes my parents were there. They'd broken in somehow and were living out of my home. And they had the nerve to greet me like we were buddy/buddy the moment I walked in. I told them to get the hell out, and they refused because it was grandma and grandpa's house. I said it wasn't their house anymore. They'd sold it to me when they retired. They'd have known that if they were in any way involved with my life. But they threw me to the wolves ten years prior with no life experience.

We argued and they refused to leave. My father told me it was his parents' house first. And that meant he and my mother had the right to live there if they wanted. I walked right into my bedroom, locked the door and called the police. When the cops showed up they were of no help. My parents claimed to them that they had already been there long enough to have residency, which was a complete lie. But I had no cameras to prove they weren't there a month. My neighbors had no cameras either.

So it was my word against my parents over how long they'd really been there, and they were claiming squatter's rights. They told police they had a verbal rental agreement with me, and that I was trying to illegally evict them for no reason. My mother even put on the waterworks when saying that. The police told me it was a family dispute, and to file eviction with the courts to get them out. And this was in 2020. Getting to court for anything took longer because of the pandemic. Meanwhile my parents are squatting in my house rent free and rubbing it in my face.

From the information I got out of them, their business went bankrupt and they sold off almost everything they had to pay their debts. All they had left was the van and a few personal belongings. So they expected to live in my house rent free for the foreseeable future.

They were working too. Both of them soon got new jobs. My father as a delivery driver, my mother as a sales associate. They were making money, and the only things they contributed to was electricity and water utilities. Which was basically just handing me a $100 bill every month and saying I should be grateful they were paying me anything. Any time I tried to discuss proper rent with them, they just said I owed it to them to live rent free because I took 18 years of their lives. And it's not like they were demanding the money back for that time. Then threatened to stop helping with the utilities all together.

I was so at my wits end that I ended up calling my grandparents to explain the situation to them. They were very unhappy, and spoke with my parents. But my parents still said they had the right to stay in my home. And refused to budge. My grandpa told me he was sorry it'd come to this. And that if they hadn't sold me the house, my parents wouldn't have invaded. I told him not to worry. I'd already filed for a legal eviction, and would get it soon enough. And my parents already knew that they were on borrowed time. I made sure to say that in earshot of my parents too. They responded with the silent treatment.

My father was away most of the time driving a delivery vehicle 6 days a week, which was a job really not to his liking. And my mother basically tried to take over my house in her spare time. She demanded I let her rearrange my living room, and even tried to force me to give her and my father the master bedroom, because they were my parents, and they deserved better, as she put it. I vetoed both of those things and said they don't deserve better, and to stop trying to act like I owe them anything. I didn't ask to be born. And it's a normal obligation for parents to raise their own children. And all they were doing was trying to assert dominance to try and keep me from kicking them out.

Finally after four months and now into early 2021, I managed to take my parents to court over their squatting. We only needed to go to court because they fought the eviction and tried to gaslight me into rescinding it. They tried to use the fact it was formerly my grandparents' house, and the fact that they were giving me $100 a month as some sort of leverage of residency. But there was no real rental agreement. And they were smart enough not to try and forge one as that would have been fraud. So the judge ordered that they needed to be out in a maximum of 30 days because they have zero claim on my house.

After court they confronted me and said they were disappointed in me for kicking out my own flesh and blood. I couldn't help but laugh and called them hypocrites because that's exactly what they did to me without a care in the world for my well-being. They had no love for me, so I have no love for them. I owed them nothing. They just tried to act like everything that was mine is theirs. But they had no right to call themselves my parents because they've never really acted like it. I called them a pair of snobby lying narcissists to their faces, and told them to get their affairs in order. Because they already know I won't hesitate to call police if they don't leave my house when the 30 days are over. My father looked enraged. But my mother stopped him from saying or doing anything by grabbing his shoulder and shaking her head. He sneered at me and walked away.

They left. But not without a lot of tension. That final month was spent with them either guilting me to try and make me change my mind, or completely ignoring me. I put up a calendar in the living room and checked off each day before they had to leave with a red marker. And the exact day they were to be out was marked with a big red circle. I still remember that final day was March 2nd. My parents waited until the exact day they had to leave my home for good before they finally left.

Even when all their stuff was out of the house and they were sleeping on the floor in the guest room for a few days. Since they were so convinced they could make me let them stay, they didn't bother to try and look for an apartment until after the court eviction went through. And my mother spent weeks scrambling to find an apartment. They had to get a tiny and crappy studio apartment in the next city over because it was the only thing they could find on such short notice. A lot like what I had to do when I was 18. Quite ironic.

I drove my mother over to see it once, and the apartment was terrible. The walls were baby barf green, the carpet looked like it was 20 years old, the only window just had a view of a brick wall outside, there was no dishwasher, the stove was the smallest one I'd ever seen, and the toilet looked like it really needed to be replaced. The walls also did little to stop noise from neighbors. There was already two people loudly fighting in the adjacent apartment while we were there. My mother went out of her way to try and give me sad looks while dropping hints that I should be feeling guilty that I was reducing them to live in such a place. But I just acted oblivious to it all until she finally stopped.

They signed the lease right away and moved what little stuff they had into the apartment over the weekend. They also ended up demanding the queen size bed, dresser and flat screen TV from my guest room. I told them to just take the damn things because I no longer wanted them in the house after they spent 5 months sleeping in that room. They looked at me like I was treating them as though they were diseased and demanded nothing more.

The moment they had to leave for good, I started changing the locks on all exterior doors. All their stuff was at the apartment, and they'd spent their last night in my guest room. They watched me start ripping the old lock off the front door as they were getting into the van. They said nothing, I said nothing. But they just sat and watched me for a while until I had the new door knob on. Then they finally left. I breathed a massive sigh of relief the second that van went down the road. I figured karma had finally come for them, and they could live under a rock for all I cared. But nope, my grandparents heard from them recently. They'd called them to brag that had a new business similar to their old one in the same state as I'm living in now.

And they are basically on track to be right back to where they used to be in life prior to the pandemic. Which was making good money and looking down on others. I've already googled their new business. And it seems like it's doing well. They have many positive reviews and everything. I'm pretty friggin resentful truth be told. They put me through being homeless, squatted for next to free at my house for months, then went right back to being the snobby wine drinking business people they used to be. If karma is real, it's taking too damn long.

**EDIT**: I would like to thank everyone for all the constructive advice. And many of the points that are being made on selling the house I'm realizing have merit. I've asked my grandparents if it'd be a good idea if I moved closer to them. They told me that if I wanna sell the house, then to go right ahead. My parents will have no clue where I am if I move away. So I'm heavily considering it now.

I'm gonna see if the company I work for can transfer me down south. I think I wouldn't mind the warmer climate anyway. I've hated winter since the time I had to live in a tent. I don't have many friends where I currently am as I'm kind of a loner. So it wouldn't be too hard to start over somewhere farther away. I'm attached to this house. But it's not like I grew up in it. So I will consider moving.

Yes I understand the need for more cameras, and will be looking into that. As for those wondering how my parents broke in and fooled police. Well it's stupidly simple. My parents got in through a window I forgot to lock. They just pulled the screen off and opened it to get right in. Then they found my spare house keys I kept hanging on a hook near the kitchen and copied them. When claiming squatter's rights to police as well as saying we had a prior verbal agreement, my parents presented working house keys to the cops and lied their little asses off saying I'd let them move in.

My parents had also already filed for an address change with the DMV online before I'd even gotten home, and showed police a printout of that they'd made. And said that their new IDs with my address were soon to be in the mail. The cops just looked annoyed, told me it was a domestic issue, and to file to evict them like a ""normal"" person. I wish I'd gotten their badge numbers to report them.

*Small Addition*: Yes my parents had their mail redirected to my house. Which is another thing they used to claim residency. The thing is that if they'd lived in my house for more than 30 days with permission, squatter's rights would make them tenants. They claimed they had my permission and used every dirty trick at their disposal to convince police they had the right to be there. There was no way for them to confirm or deny how long my parents had been living in the house. And it turned into a situation of everybody pointing fingers and police didn't know who to believe. That's why I had to go to court to evict them.

I did refuse to give my parents the wifi password while they lived with me though since they were not contributing to that utility. However they just used their smartphones to run a mobile hot spot and got internet that way the whole time they were squatting in my house.

Those of you saying that I should leave bad reviews, or expose my parents' past. There really is no point. I'm gonna take the high road there and just forget about them. However if they committed fraud to start that new business of theirs. Then I'll get some popcorn when that comes back on them. Because they'd inevitably call someone for help.

**EDIT 2**: For those who don't believe the **30 day** thing with squatters. Here's a direct USA law on the matter: In most areas, anyone who lives on your property for **more than 30 days** with permission can claim rights as in the eyes of the law they become your tenants. When this happens you will usually need to carry out an eviction procedure. However, in the case where **permission was never given** and an unoccupied property is forcibly entered and lived in, there are still rules you must follow.

My parents falsified permission and lied about how long they'd been in my house. That's why it took 5 months to get rid of them. Now you know.

[**UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/x83vbx/update_to_narcissist_parents_squatting_in_my_house/)  5 days later

Well I decided to make some inquiries and spent a couple of days asking around the family about how my parents got their new business off the ground. It's pretty unusual that they were able to come back from bankruptcy and get a new business started in under two years. No it's not an MLM for those who thought so. Even my parents wouldn't resort to doing that crap. They undoubtably think MLMs are beneath them. My parents' new business is comparatively smaller than their previous one too. I'd say about half the size. Before they had at least two employees. Now it's just the two of them.

Someone pointed out I should be watching my credit for identity theft. I already was and have been since I first started dealing with my parents squatting in my house. I put nothing past them. And they knew it. Honestly though, I'm not sure they even bothered to remember my legal information in the past decade anyway. Hell, I'm not sure they bothered to even remember how to spell my first name. But I did lock down my credit. And there has been no unusual activity on it at all. So my parents didn't try to steal their company funds from me at least.

My paternal grandparents, or my good grandparents one would say, are the ones who actually give a damn about me. And they have no idea where my parents got their money to open up shop again. My parents have called them numerous times since they disinherited my father, and they have been refusing to take their calls since they called to brag about their new success a while ago. It's clear my parents had no help from my father's side of the family. So then what about my mother's? Well I still had that old list of contacts my parents gave me filed away. And on that list was the land line number for my maternal grandmother. I did try calling my maternal grandmother back when I was homeless. She did not give a damn. I've never met them in person, but my maternal grandparents are a lot like my parents. Guess my father truly found his soulmate with my mother.

As a previous commenter pointed out, they were made for each other. I managed to get in touch with my maternal grandmother once again. And not only was she long divorced from her husband, my maternal grandfather is no longer alive. That was news to me. But he passed away seven months ago. And he left my mother a sizable inheritance. So yeah, that's where they got the money to open up shop again. My maternal grandmother sounded so proud of them too. She had little interest in speaking of much else. And it's likely why my parents called my grandparents to brag about how they are so successful again. They wanted to rub salt in the wound since my good grandparents cut them off. I really don't care though, and neither do my good grandparents. Everyone on my paternal side of the family all say my parents can go kick rocks. They want nothing to do with them.

I'm not the only one my parents have jaded. My mother's side of the family are full of divorcees and drunken loners who all hate each other and just pretend to act civil. My father's side are what I'd call just very normal and nice people. My father though burned bridges time and time again. When I was born my grandparents wanted to be in my life. But for some reason my parents kept me from them. Why they did this I'm not entirely sure. But I think it's because they didn't want to be judged on their own parenting. I'd have been happier of they'd sent me to boarding school, or to live with my grandparents. But I guess narcissists aren't truly happy if they don't have someone else to put down. I can only imagine the stuff they said about me behind my back my entire life.

Either way it seems my parents did nothing illegal to open up a new business. Nothing that can be reported to something like the IRS anyway. No law against using funds from inheritance as seed money to self employment. My mother, like me was an only child. So she got everything when her father died. Including his house and land. That's where my parents are living now. I've seen a photo my maternal grandmother sent me. Not the nicest house. But not bad. Comparable to my own I'd say. But it means my parents have a place to live scot free now, and likely won't need to bother me again. I want to sell my house and move. But it turns out the company that I'm in the employ of has no branch in Arizona. So it's either I quit and look for new employment in Arizona after selling my house. Or I just stay where I am and hope my parents leave me alone. I'm looking into job searching, because I really don't want my parents to ever find me again. I won't move if it's not feasible. But I'd prefer to be able to.

It'd be moot to bother getting more cameras for the house if I want to sell it ASAP. But if I end up stuck here because of not being able to find another job in Arizona in the coming months, then I might as well get cameras installed inside and out. I've gotten a lot of good advice on the kinds of cameras to get, and where to put them. I kind of doubt the same situation will ever repeat. But I just don't want my parents to ever try to seek me out again for any reason. If they need help when they're old, I'm not gonna care. They'll get what they gave, NOTHING! They're dead to me for the rest of my life. And the rest of my father's side of the family say the same. If I ever become a parent or stepparent, I'll make damn sure I never become like my parents. No child deserves that.

[**I was separated from my child 12 years ago. If possible I'd like to try and contact him but his mother got a restraining order against me a long time ago. Is there any legal way to proceed?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bpqws6/i_was_separated_from_my_child_12_years_ago_if/) - 17/05/19

Throwaway for privacy reasons. 

Here goes. 14 years ago I was married and we had a baby boy. At that time I was not in a good place at all. I had serious mental health issues due to things that happened during my childhood, which led to deep depression which I left untreated for a long time. 

I was a mess, I did drugs sometimes, I was unable to take care of myself, even less of a child, even if I loved him a huge lot. I was unable to connect to people and to be a good father because of my poor mental health. I had also anger issues and hated myself with a passion. I was unable to keep a job and had no stable income even though I have skills. 

My wife tried to help but at some point it was too much and she left with the child. We had a divorce when my son was about 2, and she got full custody, which I'm first to admit was the right thing for the kid. I would never have abused him but I wasn't able to supervise him properly and offer him the emotional stability a child needs.

Soon after she left my ex-wife met someone and moved in with him, then they got married. I know him a little and he's a good, stable person. I knew my kid was in a good home so it was fine. I didn't really try to see him often at the time because I was too busy spiraling, moreover I didn't think it would be good for him, which I now understand was probably not true but at the time I wasn't able to make sound decisions. I paid some child support, not much because of my low income, but I always made the payments I was required to.

Then an incident happened: my ex-wife agreed to meet me in a bar because I wanted to talk to her, and when we were there I got frustrated at how the discussion went, I yelled at her, got mad at a man who tried to intervene and ended up outside fighting with him, which terrified my ex-wife. In the end the guy had pity on me because he saw what a sorry mess I was and let it go. However that was it for my ex-wife and she said she never wanted me around anymore because I was dangerous (her father had anger management issues too so she didn't want to go through this again), and she got a restraining order against me, which I respected. She told me she would never let me near our child for fear I would hurt him. I never would but I understand how she could come to this conclusion after I had been verbally violent with her. Anyway I was sure that I would soon be dead so I just gave up and I didn't really try and see my son after that. 

Soon thereafter I was persuaded to relinquish my parental rights so his stepfather could adopt him. I thought he was young enough to forget me and he now had a good family. It hurt a lot doing this but I was convinced it was the right thing to do for him. I felt completely worthless at the time so I thought it was all for the better , and I got completely out of his life.

However time passed and after years of misery and struggling and wanting to die I finally received help and support and somehow got my shit together. I dealt with my suffering and turned my life around in a way I would never have thought possible, and I've changed for the better. All this time it hurt a lot to be without my kid even if I knew he was in a safe place. Knowing he was there somewhere has been one of the motivators for climbing out of the hole. 

I still miss him terribly, and I wonder how he's doing, what he's up to, what his life is like. I want him to know I'm there for him if he wants me. I'm not even sure if he knows about me, I'm aware contacting him could be very upsetting and I don't want to do this to him or his family. So I'd like to ask his mother what she thinks about it (and I'm prepared to be told no), and what she told him about me, but I'm not supposed to contact her because of the restraining order. I don't want to do anything illegal, moreover I have a good job now and would risk being fired if I did. 

I'm lost and don't know what to do. I know it's my fault if I didn't have any contact with him for all this time, I take full responsibility for that. And I understand that I'm not legally his father anymore. So my question is this: is there any way I can get around this without breaking the restraining order or doing anything wrong or illegal? The last thing I want is to mess things up once more.

As you advised me I got a lawyer and he was able to confirm that the restraining order was indeed expired and had been for a long time. This means I'm free to contact my son's mother, ask her if he knows about me and if she would be willing to let me write to him. Again, thanks a lot, you might not realize it but your advice gave me the boost of confidence I needed to start this process when I was stuck thinking there was no hope because of the restraining order. Time to move to the next step now (not the easiest) and pray my ex-wife will react well with me contacting her after all this time.

[**[Update] on contacting the child I gave up for adoption 12 years ago**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cca739/update_on_contacting_the_child_i_gave_up_for/)

I wrote a letter to my ex-wife. I spare you the detail but in it I apologized for what I've done and took responsibility for it. I also told her that I've made efforts to better myself and how I got my act together, and that I'm aware that she only has my word as proof for it and I know that's not much. I asked if she would let me know how she and my son were doing and if she'd be willing to share a bit about his life. I asked if he knows about me and if she thinks there's a chance she would let me contact him at some point in the future. I also added that I won't make any further attempt at contact if she doesn't answer or if she asks me to stop.

I really wasn't sure she would answer but she did. It was a long and emotional letter. I don't want to say too much but she says she has forgiven me and she's glad I'm doing better. She, my son and her husband are doing well. My son is a happy young man, he's doing great in school and has a nice group of friends. She finds him very mature for his age, he knows what he wants to do with his future. He has a good relationship with his parents and siblings. Reading this has been a huge relief, I'm so glad he's doing well. She said I was right to give him up for adoption however difficult it may have been. I knew it but reading it from my ex-wife has been incredibly comforting.

My son knows he's adopted, and he knows why his mom left with him and why he's never met me. Apart from that he doesn't know much about me. He has asked a few questions over the years and his mother has answered truthfully, and she writes that she hasn't bad mouthed me and I believe her. As for contacting him in the future, she'll think about it, but she and her husband need to talk about it first and see if my son wants it. And obviously my ex-wife and her husband will need to talk to me to see if I've changed for real. She said that she needs time to think about it and she doesn't want to rush things, but whatever they decide in the end she won't keep me in the dark.

So now all I've got to do is wait. This is a positive outcome, knowing my son is doing great is what I had been hoping for all these years and it helps a lot, even more than I would have expected. Even if I'm not sure if there will be contact in the future, there's hope so that's fine.

[**[Update #3] on contacting the child I gave up for adoption 12 years ago: good things happened!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dz1q0t/update_3_on_contacting_the_child_i_gave_up_for/)

Great things happened over the last few months! My ex-wife wrote me a second letter a fex weeks after she first answered mine and said she'd be willing to meet with me so we could talk. I hadn't thought she'd want to do this because the last time I saw her was when I scared her so much. So we met for the first time in almost 12 years. We met in a coffee shop, needless to say we both were very emotional, but things went well and we ended up remaining there all afternoon talking about a lot of things we needed to get off our chests. 

I was finally able to apologize in person for the things I put her through. I told her about my years of darkness and suffering and what caused them, the struggle to get better and the progress I've made towards healing and turning my life around. She said again that she forgives me and she understands that I was in a lot of pain and it wasn't easy, and that it makes her happy to see where I am now because in spite of it all, part of her was still worrying about me. She told me about her life with our son and the two kids she has with her second husband. They're a great family and I'm really grateful that my son is growing up between loving parents and siblings and that he's happy . We were able to talk with an open heart and we both cried a lot, but that did us a lot of good I think.

Then over the following weeks I met two more times with my ex and her husband to discuss potentially contacting my son, and they seem to agree that I'm much better than I was and I have my act together now and that I've been able to get somewhere in life. They are willing to trust me, and I am extremely grateful to them for giving me a chance, I wouldn't even have dreamed of that until a few months ago. I told them how thankful I am that they shared news of my son with me and told me about his life. 

Not knowing how he was for all that time, while there were good reasons for that, has been very tough.
From what my ex-wife and her husbands told me, in the last two years or so my son has been asking questions about why he was adopted. His parents have explained why his mom had to leave and take him with her, and how I wasn't able to be a father for him due to my issues and that I gave up my parental rights so his stepdad could raise him like his own son. 

They have told him the truth and haven't sugarcoated anything. He has asked once if they knew what had become of me (at the time they didn't), so after we met they decided to tell him that we've been in contact, and have asked him how he feels about it. He has had a rather positive reaction (he said it was cool). They told him also that I've asked if I could write him a letter but it would only happen if he's fine with it and there's no pressure for him to say yes or to answer in any way. 

From what they told me he talked about it with friends and decided that he'd be OK with receiving a letter from me. I am currently writing one (to be exact I've written and torn up about thirty versions of it in the last few days) to first thank him for letting me contact him and tell him that I love him and I'm there for him if he has any question about me, why I couldn't raise him or anything. I write that he's under no obligation of any kind to answer or do or say anything, because I completely understand that from his point of view I'm a stranger and I'm not asking for anything from him, and I won't contact him in the future if he doesn't want me to, but I'll be there if he needs anything.

I'm incredibly thankful that things went so well and I finally have a chance to contact my son. Just a six months ago I wouldn't have dared hoping for such an outcome. I feel better now than I ever have, talking to my ex-wife has been incredibly comforting. I've been crying tears of relief every day for a few weeks, I wasn't aware that I needed it so bad. I feel whole for the first time in a very long time and typing this feels wonderful.

[**[Update #4] on contacting the child I gave up for adoption 13 years ago: finally got to meet my son!**](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/io9fhd/update_4_on_contacting_the_child_i_gave_up_for/)

After discussing at long with my ex-wife and her husband I wrote a letter to my son. I made it short, just told him I was his bio dad and that as he had learn from his parents I had given him up for adoption because of some issues that I had. I told him a few things about my life, where I live, my job , my girlfriend and so on. I let him know that I was there if he wanted to write back or if he had any question about me, but if he didn't want to I would disappear from is life and not bother him any longer.

I waited about three weeks for an answer. It came under a form I had not been expecting. My son texted me one evening to say hello and wish me a happy new year. We exchanged a few texts, small talk but that meant a huge lot to me. I had left my phone number in my letter just in case, but I had imagined he would have written a letter if he wanted to talk to me. I had thought I would have time to think about my answer but with the texts I had to answer fast and not let my emotions overwhelm me. In the following weeks we exchanged texts a few more times. 

It's great because he's very direct and has no trouble asking me questions. He wants to know where I come from, he's asked things about my family and my childhood. 

That one is a bit hard because I have no family left and my childhood was a nightmare and I don't want him to be disturbed by that. I've left out the worst for now.

One day out of the blue he texted me that he'd like to meet me face to face (that was before the pandemic) because texting is OK but he'd like to see what I look like. I didn't expect that at all. I thought he'd want maybe to call or skype one day but I never imagined he would ask to meet me so soon. He said his parents were OK with it. I imagine they must have been saying good things about me if it prompted him to ask to meet me.

So we arranged for my son, his family and I to meet at a state park to do some hiking and a picnic together. At first I was very tensed and didn't know what to expect but the day went quite well (I even managed not to cry, even though I was sure I would). We had fun, we talked a lot, mostly about my son's hobbies, sports, school, well the things that matter into a teenager's life. 

He asked my about my job, where I live, my hobbies, even about my girlfriend. At no moment did we feel awkward, which had been a fear of mine. My son is smart and I could see that he has a good relationship with his parents and siblings and I'm very glad about that. They look like a loving and stable family which is what I hoped to be providing him with when I gave up my rights. We didn't speak in detail of the reasons why I had to give him up for adoption or the time when I wasn't doing well but I think it's as well for now. 

His mom told him about it a bit but not all the detail. We'll discuss it in the future if/when he wants to. We had a good day together and I feel really thankful for having been able to meet him. My son said he hoped we would meet again soon so he could get to know me better, which of course makes me very happy. I also hope that one day he can meet my girlfriend (soon to be wife!). The pandemic has kind of derailed that for now but we'll meet again soon I'm sure. In the meantime we still exchange texts regularly and skype from time to time.

I have set a trust fund for him that should help if/when he goes to college. I don't plan to have other kids and I can afford it so it's only fair, after all I brought him into this world so I feel it's my responsibility even if I didn't raise him. I hope we can build a relationship and maybe one day he'll invite my to his graduation, that's a dream of mine. We'll see how it goes. Meeting him has brought me a lot of joy and comfort. It gives me closure in a way, that's a very good feeling and I needed that. I know I'll need to navigate our relationship carefully but I feel confident that it will work and there's a lot more for us in the future.

Apparently no one in the friend group is a fan of her. 30+ people there plus kids (terrible). The friend group hangs out regularly (we used to) bc of the kids; we hadnt seen them since the pandemic. 

We all gathered around and watched Ash open so. many. gifts. We had to take a break bc we had been sitting there for an hour and there was still a huge pile of shit to open. 

During her cash grab session, she asked in front of all 30+ people why husband and I didnt have kids and that my clock is ticking. AND that at my age, Im at a high risk for birth defects. Btw, shes 23, Im mid-30s, Ashs husband is 36 and this is the first time I had met her.

I shot back that my car is my baby - I jokingly mentioned how its the same and all of the women scoffed, so offended. They started pointing out why its not the same (no fucking shit lmao) and how my car cant fill the void of children. I excused myself and went to eat all of the apps. The spread was amazing. 

During the break one of the husbands came up to me and told me about his new sports car. We went outside to geek out over our cars and test drive them. 

When we got back from a 15 minute drive, Ash was in the driveway with her husband waving us down like something was very wrong. Some of the moms started coming out to see whats up. 

Nope. Just irate that we had stepped out, that she couldnt find us, thus, couldnt start opening the rest of the presents. She screamed this wasnt about cars and this was her special day to celebrate her kid. The other women who I thought liked me enough were shooting daggers my way.

Her husband told both of us to leave. No argument from me. The guy I test drove the car with busted out laughing, which prompted me to laugh. This really pissed her off and she stomped her feet like a child and just screamed. 

Im petty so I took back the gift, my homemade macarons she requested and the other guy did the same lol. 

We got texts the next day that we should have left our gifts and the food and that were horrible friends blah blah. 

That was my weekend.

EDIT for clarification: I excused myself after Ash called me out and ate snacks, but I didnt leave to test drive the car until the 30 minute break.","childfree",6171,6171,0,0.97,8,1,2,830

Well my husband (30m) is annoyed by this, he said he liked my old look and he's embarrassed to go out with me now that I've decided to be a lazy slob, I told him I still dress up when we go on dinner dates, when we have important occasions I just don't feel like wearing make up and heels to go to the grocery store or clean the toilet anymore 

He said it wasn't that hard to out on some make up and shave, so I told him if he thought so then to prove it, go through the same treatment I go through to look Good as he put it, he agreed because if I've been doing it for years how hard could it be 

He learned how painful waxing is soon after, he learned how long it takes a woman with long thick, waist length hair to wash, dry and style it, he learned how uncomfortable wearing certain outfits everyday was for me and since he wanted me to wear make up he had too as well (he was in too deep so he let me do his make up, I didn't go full drag I only did some stuff that would enhance his features yet show him how much effort goes into make up) 

Needless to say after a full day of this he told me he was sorry and he didn't realize how much work I put into my appearance, I told him to now imagine the woman who go around getting lip fillers and botox and he laughed and said thank God I wasn't that high maintenance, we both had a laugh about it and I felt I proved my point 

Issue, he was talking to his sisters and told them what I did which they found hilarious because they too also feel it's about time men understood how much work some women put into their looks, well he told his mom what I did and now she's been calling and texting me about how I abused her son

How it's a woman's duty to look good for her husband and how I'm going to drive him away by being a lazy slob and to not be surprised when I end up divorced or cheated on, I ignored her but my husband's now defending me from his mother and she's mad that he's defending me, anyway did I mess up?

**I hate what my newborn has done to my life**


Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.


New dad here. I need to rant and I have nowhere else to go.


It's been 3.5 weeks since we gave birth to our first child. I'm now the most miserable numb I've ever been in my entire life and numb to everything around me. Nothing gives me joy anymore and I've lost any sense of purpose. My wife and I were always planning on having kids, planning to start trying in a few years, but got bored during the pandemic and accidentally got pregnant. If I knew what my life would be like now I would have never had a baby.


One could say everything with the pregnancy went as good as we could have possibly asked for. Optimistic mommies and daddies would call it the greatest gift and tell us how we are so lucky we had an easy time getting pregnant and smooth pregnancy. And although my wife had to have a c section because the baby was too large, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy. And I hate everything about him and what he's done to our lives.


I hate the constant 24/7 attention. I hate the seemingly never-ending screaming. I hate how useless he is - he just eats, shits, cries and sleeps all day. I hate that he put my wife and her body through 9 months of torture and now months of slow, post-birth recovery. I hate that I no longer have free time for myself. I hate that I don't get any alone time with my wife and our dogs. I hate that we haven't been intimate in weeks. I hate that even if we were t try and be we can't be because the baby needs constant attention. I hate that we moved out of the city we lived into more space and have a more flexible, car-dependent lifestyle. I hate that my wife and I sleep in separate bedrooms because I am a miserable, grouchy fuck if I'm woken up 4 times throughout the night. And I didn't realize how irrationally angry and triggered I would get by uncontrollable newborn screaming.


Everyone told me being a parent is so great but I just don't think it is, it seems fucking miserable. I don't want to do this for the next 18 years. I can't believe that I now get joy out of running errands and getting out of the house that I pay for each month. And I'm happiest now that I am back at work and not focused on being a caretaker (of course is I also work from home because of covid so I don't ever really get to escape).


I'm tired, I'm annoyed, I get no pleasure spending time with my kid, nothing feels rewarding, and although I help my wife as much as I can after I wrap up work, I feel a constant sense of guilt that she is doing the heavy lifting.


Ironically, I should be happy. I'm further in my career than I ever could imagine at my age, financially stable, have no real issues, and have a generally flexible and comfortable lifestyle. But I am so fucking over this phase of my life. I feel like I want to fast forward to the time when this kid is at daycare all day and daydream about moving back to where our parents live so they can watch the baby all day - but they live on the other side of the country and this would be devastating to my career.


It's been 4 weeks that feels like 4 months and I just want to be happy again.


Edit: Wow, woke up to an interesting mix of comments from people calling me a selfish idiot who needs to man up and supportive folks who have gone through similar struggles. 


I posted this mostly to vent and wasn't sure where else I could go. My wife and I are very open - she has similar thoughts although less regret in what our life was like before and what it is now. I am still adjusting to all of this and will take several people's advice to seek out therapy and quite frankly, just give it time and be more patient. Thank you all for the comments and advice, positive or negative.

**Update - Having a kid is a lot of fun, actually**

It's amazing how much changes in the span of 10 months. I actually forgot I posted this - https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/oyayu2/i_hate_what_my_newborn_has_done_to_my_life/ - until a kind commenter asked how things were going now. Anyway, to all the new dads reading this and currently worrying that their lives are over... it gets so, so much better, I promise. Take it from someone who seriously thought his life was over.

I think we had a particularly challenging baby - colic, restless, not at all calm or enjoyable to be around. I was severely depressed for about 5 months. Reading back on that post and I can hardly remember the days - the first few months were a blur, but I do remember just how painful the feelings were. 


Around 6 months is when it got better. We finally figured out what was causing the colic (GI issues, pressure your doctor for baby pepcid) and realized we needed to be closer to family (we moved halfway back across the country to be closer). Little man started to get a personality, started to learn and embrace the world, and my wife and I finally got back into a routine and an understanding of our new life. 


Wife and I had some really open talks during the first few months. I wasn't the only miserable one. Looking back, I'm absolutely selfish for not thinking that she was also experiencing similar and even worse feelings than I was. But we got through it with really open conversations and our relationship is stronger coming out it. 


11 months in and we are now planning for a first birthday party with family, about to move into to our new family home, and living in a city with a support group of other young parents with babies. It's just a world different from where I was mentally this time last year. And the kid is just so much fucking fun. He's taking his first steps, babbling, goes swimming with me every day, sleeps 12 hours a night, takes naps, eats food, and laughs at all my dumb jokes :) I honestly never thought I would like him and here we are, I'd take a bullet for him. 


Anyway, my messages are always open for new dads going through post partum depression. It is fucking real. Do not let anyone tell you you are not supposed to be feeling what you are feeling. My main piece of advice - just genuinely give it time. Find what makes you happy for the first 4-6 months and do that thing. Your kid might not make you happy and it's ok. Be patient and give it time.

[**Wife [34F] gets a 1-day fever after visiting brother's house, happened 4 times now**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kzrnny/wife_34f_gets_a_1day_fever_after_visiting/) - submitted on 18 Jan 2021

About 1.5 months ago, my wife began going to her brother's house to babysit our 2 year old niece for several hours. She plays with the baby in the morning, eats lunch there, puts the baby down for a nap, and then goes home in the afternoon. She did this maybe \~20 times total. On 3 of those days, she came home from babysitting and immediately felt fatigued and when we checked her temperature, it was 100-102 degrees. The fever always disappeared within 6-9 hours and she was feeling mostly fine by next morning. After the third time, we decided she should stop babysitting for the time being. She had no fevers since stopping the babysitting.

On Sunday (1/17) we visited her brother after not seeing them for a couple of weeks. We ate lunch together, and played with the baby. We went home and by dinner time she was feeling chills. She had a fever of 101.5.  This is now the 4th time she has gotten a fever after coming home from her brother's house. This seems to be a pattern now, but we can't figure out what it is.

Other relevant facts:

* She doesn't get a fever every time she goes to her brother's house. She has been at her brother's house many times (including babysitting) without getting a fever.
* No other symptoms besides fever.
* Until last month when this started, she hadn't had a fever in many years.
* Because of the pandemic, we don't visit anyone else's home. She is currently unemployed so she doesn't go anywhere else either.
* Nobody else in either household has reported feeling sick. She's the only one who gets the fever.
* Brother's household: Brother, his pregnant wife, and 2 year old daughter. My household: Me and my wife.
* Brother lives about 20 minutes away, kind of near some hills.
* Not sure if it's related to food. When she was babysitting, they cooked lunch for her. But there was nothing unusual that she never eaten before. Today, we ordered food from a restaurant for lunch. Brother's wife baked banana bread for us to eat. We drank instant powered coffee with it. That's about it. And like I said above, no one else has any symptoms.
* Of course it is technically possible that the fevers are unrelated to her brother's house, and just by pure crazy coincidence, are happening on the exact same days that we happen to visit her brother's house. (If this is the case, maybe I should go buy a lottery ticket...)

[**Response to OOP**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kzrnny/wife_34f_gets_a_1day_fever_after_visiting/gjqax2l/) 

Chiming in here because I have seen a few suggestions that this could be something like allergies, stress, pregnancy...I want to clarify that none of these conditions on their own will cause actual fevers, not as high as 101.5 or 102 that your wife is experiencing. A person's basal body temperature can fluctuate for many reasons, but fluctuations from something like pregnancy would not cause a true fever (which we typically define as 100.4 F or over).

Are you certain that she truly does not have fevers on the days she has not visited her brother's house? Perhaps there is something that triggers her to notice them more when she has visited their house? Since you say she doesn't come down with a fever every time she is there, my concern would be that she is having fevers at other points in time but perhaps doesn't notice it for some reason.

She should definitely get evaluated by a physician if she is having persistent or recurrent fevers. The differential is pretty wide but would include some type of indolent infection, an endocrine condition such as hyperthyroidism, autoimmune or auto inflammatory conditions, etc. Malignancy is also a possible cause, though less likely.

&gt;Are you certain that she truly does not have fevers on the days she has not visited her brother's house? Perhaps there is something that triggers her to notice them more when she has visited their house? Since you say she doesn't come down with a fever every time she is there, my concern would be that she is having fevers at other points in time but perhaps doesn't notice it for some reason. 

We're pretty certain that she does not have fevers without noticing it, but we didn't take her temperature when she felt fine, so we can't say we're 100% sure. The first time she reported having a fever, I had to run out to the local pharmacy and buy a thermometer, because neither of us had a fever in many years so we didn't have a thermometer laying around in the house. 

When she gets a fever, she is aware of it because of 1) excessive fatigue and 2) getting chills. During her last fever (yesterday) she was already feeling it before we left their house. I took off my sweater because it was warm in the house (we live in Southern California where the winters are very mild) and she asked to wear my sweater because she was feeling chills.

I will note that when she was babysitting, she would come home and usually take a \~1 hour nap. We are night owls who usually stay up until \~1am and she had to wake up around 8am for babysitting. So it was not unusual for her to come home and take a nap. She would wake up and feel rested and fine. On the days she got a fever, she would feel extra tired, take a nap, and wake up feeling terrible with the 100-102 fever. (which would subside by \~1am)

I'll try to get her to a doctor but she is reluctant to go into a doctor's office with this pandemic. :(

[**Medical mystery solved? Update on wife [34F] getting repeated 1-day fevers after visiting brother's house. One remaining question about infections...**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/owb2jb/medical_mystery_solved_update_on_wife_34f_getting/) - submitted on 02 Aug 2021

Six months ago, I asked you guys about my wife getting mysterious repeated 1-day fevers after visiting her brother's house. It seemed like no one was 100% sure of the cause. (I dont blame you guys, this was very unusual): [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kzrnny/wife\_34f\_gets\_a\_1day\_fever\_after\_visiting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kzrnny/wife_34f_gets_a_1day_fever_after_visiting/)

One new thing that happened: A couple months later, *I* started getting fevers after visiting brother's house too. Sometimes I would get it but not her. Our symptoms were consistent with some kind of bacterial/viral infection. But we ruled out food and water - we still got fevers despite not drinking any of their water, and despite ordering take-out from reputable restaurants that we've had many times in the past with no problem.

Where else could there be bacteria growing in their house? We live in a non-humid dry area, it's a relatively new house, no leaking pipes or anything... then that's when it hit me: **There's a small humidifier in my niece's room!** (whats funny is that [I mentioned the humidifier in a comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/kzrnny/wife_34f_gets_a_1day_fever_after_visiting/gjt59hl/) in my original post, but my brain failed to make the connection... *sigh*) 

So I did some reading on humidifiers... like [this](https://www.sylvane.com/blog/maintain-your-humidifier-and-health/), and [this](https://www.medicinenet.com/humidifier_fever/definition.htm), and [even another redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/kd08cv/product_question_help_finding_a_humidifier_that/). These articles are probably not the best scientific sources, so I found this too: [**https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/00213601.html**](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/nioshtic-2/00213601.html) It's a 1993 study published in the *American Journal of Industrial Medicine*. A summary:

1. One day, 16 out of 31 employees at a store suddenly all developed fevers and chills.
2. ""The onset of symptoms ranged from 5 to 13 hours after entering the workplace, with a median onset being 7 hours. The illness lasted 2 to 24 hours."" This matches our fever symptoms exactly.
3. ""A humidifier had been operating for the first time in many months on the day of the outbreak. An examination of the humidifier revealed that the baffles were covered with brownish grey sludge as it had not been cleaned since it had been purchased 19 months earlier."" Also, there was poor ventilation that day.
4. ""Organisms isolated from the humidifier sludge included three species of the fungus Fusarium, ameba of the genus Acanthamoeba, and Gram negative bacteria.""

Also, I started thinking about the full timeline of events, and the facts matched up:

1. **Why did my wife get fevers first, but not me?** Because for the first few months, my wife would babysit and go inside niece's room (where the humidifier was located) to put her down for a nap, and/or put her down to bed at night. I did not babysit, and when I was at their house I would stay in the living room and wait for her.
2. **Why did I start getting fevers later?** Because after a few months, my wife convinced me to help with our niece, which required going inside niece's room. So then I started spending \~30-45 minutes inside niece's room each time.
3. **Why did we sometimes** ***not*** **get any fever after going to brothers house?** Because we didnt always go inside niece's room. On some visits, we just ate a meal together and/or stayed in the living room. Note - We didn't *always* get fevers when going inside niece's room. I think on those occasions, we didn't stay in the room long enough (e.g., just popped in to say goodbye), and/or they may have turned on the AC recently when the house felt stuffy, which would have pumped fresh air into the room.

Armed with this knowledge, we shared it with brother and his wife. He shared some more info: He was inexperienced with humidifiers, and did not know anything about humidifier maintenance. He confirmed that 1) he had never cleaned the humidifier since buying it late last year, 2) turned it on every night, 3) used unfiltered tap water for the humidifiers water source, and 4) during the winter months he never uses the house heater (we have mild winters) so there was zero ventilation in niece's room. The humidifier is made of black plastic, so its difficult to see dirty water, but when I examined the humidifier in person, I pointed out a couple 1mm moldy green dots at the mouth of the humidifier. He immediately removed the humidifier and cleaned it upon seeing it. We have not had any fevers since then.

So then this leads to my final question for you guys: **Why did we get fevers after inhaling dirty humidifier air for under an hour, but brother, niece, and his wife seemed to have zero symptoms?** They never reported having any fevers/chills like we did. Can people develop immunity/antibodies for some bacteria/fungus? Or are some people/families just naturally immune to some bacteria? 

Patient info: Wife is 34 Female, height 5'8"", weight 127lb, race asian. My info is similar, within 5% of my wife.

I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years, we've been together since high school and attend the same college now but we decided instead of living in the dorms we got a place together just off campus.

My girlfriend has been overwhelmed by her curriculum and has been nothing but distant and stressed. She's always suffered from boughts of depression and anxiety but it has gone into overdrive and honestly its driven a divide in our relationship the last year or so.

She's also been upset about her parents who recently split up. She invited her mom to live with us and we suprisingly got along really good. One night after a few drinks her mom made a move on me and it kind of just went from there afterwards.

Last week she told me she needed to talk to me and told me she's pregnant. I was mostly confused because she's pretty old and already had kids. I told her straight away she needed to get an abortion and she said she just needed to think. We didn't speak much this last week but last night my girlfriend revealed to me that her mom was pregnant and that her mom told her dad!!!

So now my GFs dad thinks the babies his apparently and after a brief chat with her mom she coldly told me she's keeping it and pretty much told me fuck off.

I obviously can't keep dating my girlfriend and I can't pretend my kids her brother. On top of that I'm furious with her mom because she's forcing this kid into the world. Also my girlfriend has been so depressed lately that I'm afraid the truth might cause her some serious mental harm. I know im an asshole in this situation so save your judgements but I need help. What's the best way to approach this situation that leaves the least amount of damage for everyone involved?

Tl;dr: I got my already depressed girlfriends mom pregnant and she won't abort it and she's lying about her husband being the dad. How do I handle the situation with the least amount of damage to everyone?

**Edit:** doing an edit since people are commenting still.

I've decided to walk away from the situation and let it handle itself, I'm washing my hands of this. My gfs dad is claiming the baby and as far as anyone knows it's his so he's happy and her mom is also excited to have a baby from what my gf tells me. Plus me and my gf have been getting along so good lately and her mom is moving back home so there's no more tension there. Our fling as all but died.

Everythings gone back to normal but kind of better. My gf has grown to the idea of her mom having another kid and is excited for a sibling and she's even hinted that she wants us to have children together in the future! The advice to move on in this thread was great and everything is moving smooth once I let go of the fact thata it's MY baby. It's really not; the parent is who raises it. I'll probably have a kid of my own soon and my relationship is on fire right now. Thank you guys. I'll still reply to some comments where I think necessary.

**Edit:** I'd also really like to thank the people that didn't just insult me but genuinely wanted to help. You are appreciated.

**Edit:** for the people who keep saying this is like fantasy porn or something me is really weird. No where in this post did I give any sexual details and before I hooked up with her I never had any older woman fantasy it just happened.

**Edit:** I've replied to so many messages I think thats all I got in me, and a lot of messages now are just insults or trolls saying my life doesn't exist, but I wanted to say again thank you to everyone who tried to help and give me advice even the ones that don't agree with me. I know you guys think otherwise but leaving my girlfriend isn't the right choice for us right now though its nice you guys are concerned. Whatever happens in the future happens and I'll have to handle it then. If you guys want an update in the future I can do that.

I wasn't going to do an update do to all the backlash of hate I got both on my post and even worse in my inbox on top of people just calling my problem fake but there were people who gave good advice and really helped me during a hard time so this update is for them.

The advice I got to back off regarding the baby situation worked itself out really well. My girlfriends mom moved back in with her dad for about a month but ended up leaving again because she had a miscarriage and her dad was really upset about it. According to my girlfriend her mom was still drinking/smoking throughout it and her dad was constantly fighting with her about stopping for the baby and when it passed away he blamed her (which isn't fair because it's not his body or place to judge what she does with it) and was really devastated at the loss and isn't doing to well mentally right now but I think he'll get better soon, my girlfriend has been visiting him a lot and comforting him.

My girlfriend thinks her mom made up the pregnancy to get back with her dad because she's known to be dramatic but I don't think it makes sense because why would she tell me I got her pregnant? She wanted to move back in with us but my girlfriend and I put our foot down and said she couldn't. Her moms still upset with her for not letting her stay but she's staying at a friend's house now so it worked out.

I took advice I got in the thread and talked to my girlfriend about going to therapy and she was really supportive about it. We've gone to 4 or 5 sessions now and I can't believe how much it's made our lives better. I was able to hear her explain what she's currently going through with her depression and see how much her family life has affected her. We also all agreed that I was way overwhelmed as well dealing with her depression, the pandemic, and my college courses on top of her moms drama she brought to our house and that because of it I've become distant too and not supportive of my girlfriend anymore which only worsens her depression. We decided that I needed to start taking more time for myself and doing things that make me happy again and my girlfriend agreed to letting me have more free space and to try to give me more attention and affection when needed and that I would do the same for her.

We've both decided to take a semester off our schooling and take the pressure off our shoulders for a little while which I'm really excited about. A couple of guys and I were thinking about doing a hiking trip for a couple of weeks and she wants to do some art thing so we'll see what the future holds.

Thank you to everyone who actually tried to help and didn't just see me as a devil but a good person who did a bad thing who's just trying to figure his life out. I appreciate the support.

**Edit:** No I didnt tell her about her mother and I because that is in the past and it's a situation that will only hurt her more than help heal us. Somethings are better left unsaid.

**Edit:** can the negative people stop replying now? I was hoping to hear from the people who had helpful progressive advice.

[**My husbands sister moved in to our home for a temporary amount of time but now refuses to leave.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jhahet/my_husbands_sister_moved_in_to_our_home_for_a/) - 24 Oct 2020

&amp;nbsp;

To give some context before hand, when my husband and I were building our new build, the house we currently own and reside in now, we had to stay with my in-laws. They were nice enough to ease that bit if a financial burden on us while our house was being built. During the time there, my husbands sister (22) was living there with her two kids and one baby on the way. Well least to say I hated living there. Especially around her. Shes messy, shes dirty, doesnt pick up after herself or her kids, doesnt clean around the home, doesnt contribute to any of the house hold income, NOTHING. Shes never had a job and doesnt even know how to drive, so for obvious reasons she doesnt have an income.

Fast forward to my husband and I living in our new 5 bedroom home, his sister ended up moving in with her baby daddy. We thought they were doing fine until she came crying to us literally knocking at our door step in the middle of the night saying BD kicked her out because hes tired of her. I felt so bad for her we let her stay at our place. I asked her what happened &amp; she said hes done. So her BD &amp; I arent the closest but I did ask him if everything was ok? Just because she has a tendency to lie sometimes. BD said he was tired of coming home to a dirty home, to eat fast food all the time (because she doesnt know how to cook) to having their sons constantly sick because all they eat is ramen &amp; fast food. Hes tired of it. He told me that he shouldnt have to work 12hr days &amp; come home to a mess, nothing cooked, etc. (Before she moved in with BD I encouraged my husbands sister to learn how to cook, that I could teach her but she declined).

Its been 2 months now since we let her stay at our house , luckily its big enough but she doesnt pull her weight around the home. Im tired of waking up to screaming kids, while Im currently pregnant myself. Im tired of seeing the living room a mess while she sleeps in late until 1pm. Im tired of her freeloading off of our stuff. I refuse to cook more than I have to. I let her figure it out for herself. My husband buys her food Or fast food but i told him not to do that. I told him its not our or HIS responsibility to have to be providing for the babies either. The babies Ill give a snack too, Ill make sure theyre eating right but its still not my responsibility.

I told my husband that I was tired of it, and he said there was nothing he can do because thats his sister. I told him that she could go like with either one of his parents ( since theyre divorced ) she has plenty of options and family. But she says she doesnt want to be a handful for them because of the kids.. well frankly shes a handful for me too.. in one instance, there was a handful of dirty dishes that have been stacking up for the day while my husband and I worked. They were all from her and the babies , I was so mad I washed them all and she asked if I was nesting. Some of our family members came unexpectedly, and Infront of them all I said,  no Im not nesting, Im cleaning up the dirty dishes youve let yourself accumulate and not care to even wash. She gave me the dirtiest of looks.

Ive told my husband to talk to her about leaving and she wont leave. She just wont. I told him its either me &amp; the family hes decided to create with me. Or his sister. I told him that until shes not out of this house, Ill be leaving, and I wont be coming back. Its began to take such a toll on my marriage with my husband Im not sure whats going to happen.

Im not sure what to do anymore? How do I make her leave my home ? How do I make my husband understand that I dont want her here. Shes not my responsibility.


&amp;nbsp;

[**UPDATE 1**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jldzav/update_my_husbands_sister_moved_into_our_home_for/) - 31 Oct 2020

&amp;nbsp;

First of, thank you all for the advice and suggestions. I sat down with a lawyer and talked about if its possible for the sister to be considered a tenant and if so can we charge rent. Well luckily in my state my SIL isnt considered a tenant so I would not have to charge rent. I also wouldnt have to serve her with any type of tenant eviction as there is no binding contract. Because of this I have obtained a notarized letter that is allowing her 30 days to pick up her things and leave. Im being courteous enough in giving her that much time. Ive decided to do this before sitting down and speaking to my husband about the issue. After I obtained the notarized letter, I spoke with my husband. I told him how I felt about my home looks like a mess, how I shouldnt be having to take care of his sister and children, being pregnant, and how shes should be responsible enough to be able to take care of herself. We both agreed to sit down with her and talk to her.

The next day as we sat down and talked with her after we got home from running some errands, I let him talk. I let him tell her that she was no longer welcome in our home. He told her the reasons ( being a slob, not picking up after her children, not contributing to our our household in any way, and making my pregnancy a living hell). I realized how it sort of pained him to have to tell her that, but its something she needed to know. While having this discussion she retaliated and said she was being attacked and wouldnt leave because she didnt have else where to go. I told her she did. She could go to my in laws, other family members but inside my home , to live in , she was no longer welcome. She made the smart ass comment of saying,  youre going to toss me out in the middle of a pandemic and I said yes. Yes I am. I told her she has people to go to and live with. That my home wasnt her new nesting ground &amp; that she shouldve thought about the comment she just made when her BD kicked her out. I pulled out the eviction notice and told her she has 30 days to get her shit together, or else Im going to be calling the cops to have her removed from my home. My husband wasnt too proud of it, and was mad that I would actually serve her with a notice. I told him right infront of my SIL that if she doesnt leave in 30 days, that I will, and he will not be allowed to see me or the baby until shes out of the house. I told him I didnt bust my ass working so she can enjoy the luxuries and commodities Ive been working so hard to enjoy myself. She wont have her own room at my in-laws oh well, go get some job experience and get an apartment. Cant keep BD to stay with you because you cant seem to learn how to cook or clean, or have an basic sense of maintaining a house hold, shouldve thought that before opening your legs and deciding to get pregnant again with a 3rd child.

All and all, shes been served with an eviction notice and I have packed my bags incase she doesnt leave. I have taken picture of valuable items in my home and pictures of her current living situation. Dirty rooms, the mess she leaves laying around for days, the kids not being fed a proper meal. Everything. My lawyer has recommended that if she does not leave and my husband decides to have her stay and hed be responsible then I should consider filing for divorce.

I set my foot down, and listened to you all. Thank you again for your comments and supportive advice. I will keep you updated as the situation progresses.


&amp;nbsp;

[**UPDATE 2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/kru92n/last_and_final_update_my_husbands_sister_moved/) - 06 Jan 2021

&amp;nbsp;

Im sorry to have kept you all waiting for the situation regarding my SIL. Here is the last and final update on the situation.

Soon after I gave her the notice I got the cold shoulder from SIL and my husband for about a week or so. I absolutely hated having to sleep beside my husband knowing he disliked what I did. Eventually he came around and realized what this was doing to our family when in an instance he was working from his office and the babies where out in the living room some crying nonstop and she was in her room while talking on the phone. Thats when he saw and realized that she was being neglectful the rift this was causing in our family, and knew something needed to be done about it.

During this time that SIL wasnt talking to me at all, she posted comments about me on social media, and tried to in a way drag me for the decision I made regarding her living situation. Well family members who were aware of the situation sent me screen shots and I kept it for court records if necessary about what she was saying about me online. Calling me toxic, and that I thought I was better than everyone else because I had everything , and that if It werent for her brother ( my husband ) that I wouldnt have what I have now. Well not that it matters but I am very well set off with the business I decided to run two years ago so I dont need your brothers money, but nice try. I did gather some informational packages about child care, and where she could go and drop off her kids for free and some well trusted places &amp; so on so she can get a job &amp; attempt to make some progress but she threw them out. I tried.

At around maybe like 25ish days was when she moved out, and her baby daddy ended up taking her back. I had the locks to my home changed, and was able to restore some peace into my home. My husbands family had mixed feelings about the situation and how it was handled but if no one else was going to show her some form of tough love or be responsible for their own blood acting like this, then I dont know who would. Its was so easy for some to judge when they werent even willing to help her out at all.. It really sucks that it went this far and that my husband only gets to see his nephews on occasion but I guess better me than blood family right? If it were my Hispanic family members in this position they wouldve been booted out of their household without hesitation until they figured it out. And thats the kind of tough love I grew up with. Sounds a bit harsh, but definitely does work. I dont know, I feel somewhat shitty but also I would never take advantage of someone elses hospitality the way she did. Im coming up very close to my due date and as I get bigger and a little more unable to do much around the house, Im just glad its clean.

Thank you all once again for riding in this journey for me, and if by any reasons there are any future updates I will let you know.

We met in college and got married shortly after graduating.  We are both very career oriented and have professional goals that we want to obtain.  About 8 years ago we had multiple changes in our lives.  The first was me finding out I was pregnant unexpectedly.  The second was my husband losing his job when the company he worked for filed for bankruptcy.  

We had a lot of hard conversations about what these two things meant for our lives.  Ultimately, we decided to keep the baby and have my husband stay out of the workforce to get our home ready for a child and to be a SAHD while I continued to pursue my career.  We came to this agreement with the understanding that he would be able to pursue his career again in the future.  Then, 4 years ago we had another unexpected pregnancy.  (Yes, I was on birth control and taking it properly, but no we were not using condoms.)  Now we have 2 lovely and amazing children.  

The pandemic hit my husband harder than it did me as he was taking on the majority of childcare and the schooling at home for our oldest was difficult.  As hard as it was on him, this time period couldn't have been better for my career.  Over the past 2 years I have received multiple promotions and my career trajectory is years ahead of where I thought it would be.  

A few weeks ago I received a job offer from a different company that would be another big jump for me.  However, it would require relocating to a different state.  I excitedly brought this up to my husband but he wasn't happy for me. 

He asked what that would mean for him going back to work and I told him that it would take some time for us to get assimilated to the area and for me to get accustomed to the new job as it would probably be higher stress than what I am doing now, but with much higher pay and benefits.  I told him that we could discuss him going back to work in maybe a year or so after we move.  

He told me that he's tired of being a SAHD and he's becoming resentful of watching me get to achieve my goals and dreams while he is living a life he never envisioned himself doing.  He told me I'm being selfish to want to uproot our family for my job and for asking him once again to put his goals and dreams on hold so that I can achieve more of mine.  

I told him that him being a SAHD doesn't have to be permanent and this is just another huge step for us as a family.  He cut me off and said ""No, it's a huge step for YOU. For the rest of us it's just moving.""  I told him that was unfair and he said the unfair thing was me breaking promises I made to him.  I told him that was years ago and things have changed.  

If I'm being honest, I know it is going to be hard for him to get back in his career after being gone for so long.  A huge gap like that in his employment record is almost DOA for him to get a good job.  I feel bad about it, but we do have a pretty good life as it is and this new job would only offer more opportunities.","AmItheAsshole",5626,5626,0,0.9,0,0,2,1384

**TRIGGER WARNING \*\*** &gt;!DEATH / ABUSE!&lt;

\*\* OOP REPLACED THE ORIGINAL POST WITH HER UPDATE. I PULLED THE ORIGINAL POST FROM THE AUTOMODERATOR \*\*

*Originally Posted by* u/throwaway08389 *2 months ago:*

So my husband and I got pregnant in 2020 and had our daughter February 27 of 2021. We didn't tell either side of the family about the pregnancy. Both sides were told after my daughter got out of the hospital.

My husband brought the idea of hiding the pregnancy after I had two panic attacks about tell our families. I was worried that I would get everyone hopes up and miscarry like the last time.The only people who knew outside of us were my boss, his boss, and our doctor.

We weren't going to post pictures of her or announce her birth until after both of our family got to see her. We sent both sides pictures of her and asked that they wait until we announce on social media. Not an hour after receiving pictures, my MIL posted them. I let that slide.

My family didn't mind not knowing. They were just happy about the new baby. His family was absolutely pissed that we hid our pregnancy. They were upset that they didn't get to do a gender reveal and baby shower. Don't get me wrong, they are happy about our daughter. They love her to death but I don't think they are ever going to stop telling me about how I hurt them and how could I be so selfish to rob them of wonderful joys of pregnancy.

In a couple weeks, my daughter will be turning one. My daughter is the only grandchild currently and my MIL is dying.

As her dying request, she has asked that since we didn't have a gender reveal nor baby shower, we should throw a big birthday party for my daughters first. I shut this down immediately.

My daughter is a pandemic baby that has never really interacted with people outside of the household. It took her a good 30 minutes before she let my parents touch when we saw them for the new year. She has seen my parents way more often than his due to fact we live closer to them and she still reacts like that. So imagine trying to do a birthday party for her with 20+ plus people she don't really see. I can tell you the only thing she would do is bury herself into my chest.

My MIL is now upset and his family is now pissed. My husband, because he loves his mother dearly and she is dying, said that maybe we should just do the party and get it over with and if anything happens, we'll handle it. I told him that it's not happening because one I'm not forcing my daughter into a situation where she will be uncomfortable just for the sake of others. And two it ain't we who will handle it, it will just be me. I will be the one to deal with an inconsolable infant because in a new situation like that she won't let him touch her. I will be the one who has to deal with family, who don't understand boundaries, trying to touch or hold her which would only upset her more. My husband agreed, apologized and drop it.

But I'm still the asshole at the end of the day because I hid the pregnancy and I refuse to carry out the dying wish of a grandma who wants to celebrate the life of at least one of her grandchildren before she passes.

*Comments from OOP*

We have offered a compromise but MIL refuse and want a big party

\---------

On the contrary to popular belief, I am a social butterfly. I love the spotlight. My husband is opposite. Also i have been attending therapy.

\---------

I told her that i would do a small dinner with just her and FIL but a big party was not happening. She refuse to compromise. She wants the big party.

\---------

I wouldn't mind it but i would mind my daughter pulling at her hair and freaking out. I can't handle it. It breaks my heart when she freaks out like that and forcing her into situation like that. We would both have meltdown at the end of the day.

\----------

**Original Post received  A LOT of YTA. OOP then deleted her post and put in the following background information and update. I believe this was updated THREE days ago based on comment from OOP:**

\*\* TRIGGER WARNING \*\* - &gt;!Death of Child And Abuse!&lt;

UPDATE. I believe this is how you update.

First is the info that I was told was important.

My husband is autistic. I, like my mother, have ADHD. It is highly suspect that my daughter is autistic but we wont have a formal diagnosis until she is two.

The next thing is that my previous miscarriage wasnt a miscarriage i just call it. The reason I do it is because it is simpler than telling the whole story. Me and my husband met in college and in 2016 I got pregnant. My husband Jay was overworking himself to make sure everything was ready for our son. Well I was 37 weeks along, Jay came home extremely tired and immediately collapsed on the couch. He was so tired he didnt even drive home he had a coworker drop him off. I was having cravings and didnt want to wake him up so I took myself to Walmart. I was hit by a drunk driver and had a placental abruption. That's how my son died.

I have had anxiety, depression and therapy long before my son was ever a thought. Anxiety and Depression since i was little and the therapy since high school.

My anxiety about telling our family wasnt because I was afraid she died. I was afraid of our family's reaction, and I am pretty sure I said that in the previous post. When Noah died, Jay's family made little comments like that if I was a good mother my son would still be here. Or if I was a good mother, I wouldnt have let him die. I would have given my life for him if I was a good mother like that. And when Jay and I decided to get married they only got worse. Like why would Jay marry a woman who couldn't even protect his child. Or why does Jay want to marry something damaged like me? Or why would he want to marry the woman who killed his child? Why would he marry someone who couldnt have his child? Stuff like that and if we had told them and I lost her then they would have been right.

Plus the comment my mom made when we put Noah in the ground. She was talking to someone and said its so devastating to have to see such a small casket. I know she didnt mean no harm to me but to know that my mom was devastated just about ripped my heart to pieces. So telling no one I was pregnant meant that if we had lost her no one would have had to know. It also meant that with me and Jay being who we are, we would have pretended that I was never pregnant the second go around.

Jay was adopted as a baby. His bio mom had died during childbirth and his bio father died overseas while she was still pregnant. Jay is a 67 and 260+ pound black man. He is insanely huge and has been since he had a growth spurt at like 12. Even with his size he is insanely fast like breaking records when on the track team fast. Jay, however big, is a gentle giant and most times likes to shrink on himself and make it seem like he is smaller than he is. And he is quite good at that too. He, remember this, doesnt get angry. He is afraid to. He is afraid of being scary or in his words Goliath. The years that we have been together he might be ticked but angry is another thing. His family is all white and unannounced to me is racist. Jay himself says that he was the token child of his family.

Jay is a pushover for his family and a people pleaser. He used to defend me against his family's comments until I told him not. He didnt agree with the big party at all and initially agreed with me but because his mother guilted him he changed his mind. Like I said he is autistic and they knew when he was little. I recently learned that he was in ABA until he was older. Coming from his older brother Alex, who is disowned from the family, they used to purposely hold Jay down and overwhelmed him so that he would act normal. Jay doesnt like clapping, never has and they would hold him down and clap around him so he would get over it. He can be easily manipulated by his family into doing things he dont like.

My daughter has a small playgroup she goes to. It's a small class of like 15 kids all in separate stations and areas. So it was kinda incorrect of me to say she doesnt really like people outside of the household. She plays with the other kids sometimes and she sits by herself playing by herself. Her meltdowns are not tantrums she has both and they are quite different. Her tantrums are her fussing and whining. Her meltdowns means she is pulling her hair, scratching herself, screaming until her voice goes horse and shell bang her head on the ground repeatedly.

Now to the update

We took the advice and tried to compromise with a small party of ten people not including FIL, MIL, Me, Jay and the birthday girl. She didnt agree at first but then changed her mind. This should have been a flag to me and was one to Jay. Jay was actually shocked when she agreed. The woman never compromises, it's either her way or no way and it always has been. So she agreed and Jay didnt trust it. He didnt believe her but I talked him into it. She wanted to host it and decorate her house and said that all we needed to do was get there. I accepted without hesitation because the woman had never pass up an opportunity to tell me my ideas or work was stupid.

Second red flag was when we arrived the night before and her house wasnt decorated with the decorations I had sent but instead Minnie Mouse. My daughter Kay loves Meo Mao, which is a cartoon with clay cats that comes on the Baby First channel. I even ordered a Meo Mao cake at her local bakery but she had that changed to Minnie Mouse as well. When I asked her she said that those decorations were stupid so she did this instead. I was too tired and didnt care to fight her on it.

Third red flag was the day of the party and she and all the sisters in law were in the kitchen cooking. I was suspicious about the amount of food they were preparing and making but when I asked SIL A just brushed me off saying that we can never be too careful and don't want to run out of food. I said fine and left to go to the store for a birthday girl badge. Its kinda a tradition in my family.

Fourth would have been the fact that when I returned that instead of the beautiful yellow dress that my grandmother had handmade for Kay to wear she was wearing a store bought Minnie Mouse dress. When I had left, Jay had just finished putting on the yellow dress. This is when I should have stopped everything and intervened. I didnt. Kay didnt look happy in her dress and I think it was because of the fabric. We use certain fabrics in the house because Jay wont touch some fabrics. Kay is turning to be the same way.

We had already hit three strikes and Jay wanted to leave but I told him for his mother that we would suck it up and reminded him that she was willing to downsize the party. Now looking back at it I wish we would have left like he wanted.

We get downstairs and people start showing up. More than 15 people, which was the number that was agreed on, were there. I think there were about 30+ people and I was not happy about that. I said something to my mother in law and she just brushed me off saying that this was her house and it was open to whoever wanted to come. I wish I had left then but I didn't. Kay actually was quiet and observed people. She was still not keen on leaving my lap but it was a shock that she wasnt burying herself into my chest. She wasn't facing me and she seemed calm. We had the birthday cake down before the food because I wasnt sure that if we waited to do it, she would participate. We sat her in her highchair and set her smash cake in front of her. We sang and Me and Jay helped blow her candles out. She wouldnt touch the smash cake and when father in law pushed her hand into it, she made a noise and ended up flipping the cake off her tray. Jay managed to catch the cake with his lightning fast reflexes. As the party continued i felt like I was peeing on myself which is usually a sign of my period. I handed Kay to Jay and went up stairs to the bathroom. There was a little bit of blood and I put a pad on before calling my doctor. I was pregnant and we had found out before the party. Turns out it was just spotting and there was no need for worrying. By the time I got downstairs the crowd of people had shifted. I manage to spot Jay in a corner shrinking on himself. Kay was nowhere near him. I turned when I heard a wail. FIL was trying to hold Kay and she was fighting like hell. She managed to headbutt the life out of him and before I could get to them he started to spank her. I snatched Kay away and before I could say anything FIL went off.

You know if you would actually discipline Kay she wouldnt have done that. But no you and your people dont care about respect or discipline yall are just a bunch of monkeys who think they can do whatever please you. IF that kid is anything like Jay was you might want to think about getting her ABA. At least now he acts like an actual human being.

Again Jay was on the other side hadnt moved what so ever so it was quite scary when all of sudden he was standing over FIL. Jay didnt say anything, just kinda stared at him before whipping around and dragging me away. FIL flinched when Jay had started to move. All we had was our keys and jackets and left. MIL and FIL live about a good 5 and a half hours away so when we visited we planned to stay the weekend and pack bags. We left all of that and drove for a good hour. Kay just cried and cried and with Jays and mine phones ringing off the hook, I was starting to reach my wits so we ended up at a hotel.

Once we had managed to get settled in a hotel room Jay decided to finally answer his phone.

He had put it on speaker and it was a group call and everyone was going off about how disrespectful we were and that Jay wasnt raised that way. MIL made some comments about me and he went off. He yelled and told his mother she was dead to him and that he didnt give a damn about her anymore. He said Fuck her and the rest of the family and told them not to contact him again. Again Jay rarely gets angry and he tries to avoid confrontation because he believes he will always be the bully. So when he started to go off I knew that he had snapped and I was scared. Kay had stopped crying to watch him and when he got off the phone he turned towards us. He tried to reach out to Kay but she flinched away from him and the look of hurt on his face. He knew that he had scared us both so he grabbed his jacket and left. I know from previous experience when it is too much for Jay he leaves and returns when he has calmed down. I expected him to return at like 6 since it was only 2:30. He didnt come back until 11 the next morning. Turns out he went back to get our stuffed and Kay comfort toys.

His mother passed away on the sixteenth of March. They had called Jay the week before to come see her because she had gotten sick and wasnt going to bounce back. Jay flat out refused and I tried to convince him. When his mother did pass, I tried to convince him to go to her funeral for closure but he told me no. Jay had trauma with funeral homes to the point that he doesnt want Kay to go to any funeral. Apparently when he was eight, his family were planning a funeral for his great grandmother. Jay was tiny as a child all the way up to puberty. There were three separate incidents. 1. His great grandmother's eyes had opened and he was there when it happened. 2. His cousins locked him in a room with dead bodies. 3. Those same cousins put him in a casket and locked it. They werent punished because boys will be boys but he got into trouble when he didnt want to go back into the home. So it was going to be a hassle getting him to go beforehand. I told Jay that he might regret his choices. Jay told me he regrets not killing her his damn self and that if he does regret in the future hell go to her grave but now the reason he would go to her grave would be to dance on it.

This reaction didnt make sense to me before Alex explained it all to me. Alex is the only other person Jay really talks to outside of me. So when I told Jay not to defend me he respected that but he also made sure no extreme comments were made in front of me. This was a long time coming and I just didnt know it.

I learned a lot from Alex. Apparently they had planned to embarrasses me on our wedding day. Jay had managed to stop them without me knowing. They had group chats where they would talk about me and everything under the sun and the only reason we know is because there is a rat among them. Katie is the baby of the family and the rat. Her, Jay, and Alex are close and she tells them everything and is nothing but a watcher. She is the reason Jay was able to stop me from seeing everything they did.

Also Jay had found his bio family on his mom's side. All of his bio dad family is dead but his moms are all alive and live in Africa. They had tried to take him and had tried to get into contact with him as a child and his family denied them access. Apparently Autism is common on his mom's side and they are okay with it. His bio mom had as well. His parents were not okay with him contacting them and said he was ungrateful and all other things for speaking with his bio family. He told me he had found them but nothing else and its because they would have loved and accepted him. They wouldnt have tried to fix him . It hurts to talk to them because that is all that Jay thinks about. He would have been normal to them.

Jay is a very different person than he was years ago. I helped him find healthy coping mechanisms and showed him that past behavior wasn't good. Also I was the reason he finally stood up to his family. I wouldnt let anyone walk all over him and told him it wasnt okay for anyone including family to do that. So from the beginning I was hated by his family. In the end I was right about the party and we no longer deal with any of them. Jay says that his bio family, Alex, Katie, Kay, Caleb (our new baby), and me is all that he needs. So we are all good and happy.

I also have two siblings, an older brother (M35) and a younger (M29). 

Me and my older brother both have kids. My younger has none, and has bounced from fling to fling. 

However in 2020 before the pandemic hit he met this girl (F23). Well call her Amber. (Fake name).

From day 1 he was obsessed with her. They started dating and when we thought wed only meet her once then never again, she stayed coming round. 

We were all happy to see my brother get serious about someone, even if they were a bit younger than him. 

However as Amber started spending more time around our family, collectively we all noticed certain things she did we didnt like. For just a couple of examples.

She would move something in whoevers house we were in, and say this looks better like this, so I moved it for you. 

Or she would get into peoples stuff and say were family now so we can share. Such as when she used my SIL lotions and makeup without asking. 

But this was the thing that made us all dislike her. She would constantly talk proudly about how she turned my quote spineless fuckboy baby brother into a man. Okay, unnecessary but he was a player before so I get the joke. But then she added Ill do what your mom couldnt and teach him to be a gentleman. 

And yes. She really has said that on more than one occasion. 

Weve all mentioned these things to my brother but he brushes it off or says I love her dude what can I do. And welp&. He proposed to her at the beginning of 2022. And no she hasnt changed her antics since 2020.

Anyway. Amber came over with my brother for my wifes birthday party. Of course my kids were there too. Amber , Im front of a house full of mine and my wifes family she says oh its my favorite niece and nephew! Before picking up my daughter. She added am I your favorite aunty? In a baby voice, as if she was saying it to my daughter.

I walked over and took my daughter out of her hands and said in a calm but stern tone youre not their aunt. So please dont refer to yourself as their aunt. She seemed taken back and immediately got defensive saying Im marrying your brother so I will be their aunt by marriage.

I just shrugged and calmly responded that I didnt care if they got married, she could be Mrs. Amber or Amber but she was not their Aunt. 

A few people heard and pretended not to, but Amber was upset and left and my brother came in asking what happened. After I told him he said I was an ass and took off after Amber.

My brother called me that night saying I needed to apologize and take back what I said, but I refused to. 

My kids hardly know/spend time with her, and shes not very well liked amongst our family.

----------------------

&amp;#x200B;

In the world of economics, there are two general factors that affect prices broadly: supply and demand. Since the Fed cannot increase the supply of commodities in any meaningful way, the only way they can broadly effect prices downwards is demand-side, meaning to fight inflation they must destroy demand by making it prohibitively expensive to borrow, crushing equity markets, and eliminating the much vaunted wealth effect that they claim rescued the US economy from the depths of 2008.

**The problem is, this will certainly cause a recession (actually it already has,** [**Q1 GDP printed -1.6%**](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)**, and** [**Q2 came in at -0.9%**](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product)**).** Normally, a recession is in many ways a good thing; leveraged businesses and unhealthy enterprises are cleaned out of the system, temporary pain is inflicted on the economy, but this lays the groundwork for new firms to rise out of the ashes.

However, in an economy as indebted as ours, a slight increase in interest rates can mean catastrophic increases in interest expenses in the financial system- especially for over indebted companies, right as their net margins are squeezed by inflation.

The Fed is currently intent on fighting record inflation by crushing bondholders, including holders of US Treasuries and Corporate Debt. This will have disastrous implications for the American economy at large.

Lets take a look at the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond index (AGG):

&amp;#x200B;

[AGG Index](https://preview.redd.it/o9c9a03fkhl91.png?width=1238&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=e21574d17b6cd88e9a6674daf75aca7372660d16)

(The total return of AGG year-to-date is shown in the dark black line. The other lines show the total returns for the AGG for each of the prior 30 years.)

Prior to 2022, the worst year was 1999, when the AGG had a total return of -5%. Its best year was 1995, when it rose 19%. **This year it is down 12%. April was the worst month ever for the bond market.**

The Fed is on a single-minded mission to fight inflation, [according to Jim Bianco](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/articles/2022/05/07/jim-bianco-the-fed-will-crush-inflation-and-with-it-the-stock-market) (president and macro strategist at his own firm, Bianco Research, L.L.C.). To do that, it will crush stock prices and home values.

**We have seen nothing like this, Bianco said. The bond market has never been this bad in terms of total return. He likened that decline to the S&amp;P being down 50% to 60%.**

There is tremendous stress in the bond market, he said. There is going to be a problem, but the bond market is too complex to say where it will eventually be.

&amp;#x200B;

[$15.5 Tn Drawdown in both Equities and Fixed Income](https://preview.redd.it/9qtv4fnkkhl91.png?width=798&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bd0517defa9b4d8323e8660c8da39f8ddc6a97b1)

The only way to get the inflation rate down that much is to keep markets under stress, Bianco said. **The Fed will raise rates until inflation comes down or something breaks.**

**This mirrors my predictions of the Fed taper backfiring, sending us into a deep recession or depression, and QE Infinity beginning (see** [**Dollar Endgame Part 4.2**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/qassc0/hyperinflation_is_coming_the_dollar_endgame_part/)**).**

**The Fed, unknowingly or not, has led us into a hellish dimension of their own design- the Upside Down. They will try everything to escape, causing escalating volatility in markets and worsening inflation, in a futile attempt to get out of the debt trap they created. And if they do nothing, the downturn will only get worse.**

Bond ETFs are being taken to the woodshed. iShares 20 Year ETF, TLT, the most popular long term Treasury ETF, is down a whopping 24% this year alone. Vanguards version, VGLT, is down more than [21% this year](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vglt#).

According to Refinitiv Lipper data, U.S. bond funds witnessed outflows worth a net $8.81 billion, the most in a week since June 22.

Furthermore, Emerging Markets were hit hard as well- according to the [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-08-26-2022/card/emerging-market-relief-rally-stumbles-JPe78jZIHT2Zoku79di5), investors pulled $108 million from EM bond funds last week, on resurging concerns that the strong dollar and the Fed aggressively tightening can put emerging markets under further pressure.

This matters because the bedrock of American financial planning is the 60/40 risk parity portfolio- 60% stocks, 40% bonds. This is the most common portfolio recommended to Baby Boomers (who hold the vast majority of US wealth), and is taught to financial advisors by firms such as Northwestern Mutual, Vanguard, Fidelity, Goldman, and many others. Most advisors will tell you this portfolio is bulletproof, it has rarely had down years, and it is a set and forget method to steadily build wealth passively.

The portfolio construction is predicated on the theory that stocks and bonds are inversely correlated- when one is up, the other is flat or even slightly down- so the portfolio automatically hedges itself. In theory.

However, what they fail to mention is that this portfolio is usually only back-tested with a 40year timeframe- when we run the calculations out further, we see that actually stocks and bonds move together more often, and less time inversely, than previously thought. For example, from 1883- 2015, stocks and bonds moved in tandem 30% of the time, and moved inversely only 11%. It is only the past few decades of quantitative easing, infinite liquidity, and zero bound interest rates that this portfolio has worked as intended. (Refer to [this research paper](https://artemiscm.docsend.com/view/2b34894bzsaqsbcx) by Artemis Capital- positive correlation is bad in this case, see below for the sections marked in red).

Debt defaults spreading throughout an economy is par for the course during a recession. This can be clearly seen in a [graph of non-financial corporates](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=VLW) debt to GDP. (i.e. US businesses excluding banks and broker-dealers)

&amp;#x200B;

[Nonfinancial corporate debt to GDP](https://preview.redd.it/7vrcvg0ykhl91.png?width=754&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dea5bb2d5b9714606f18f9f04a2832d91ea17610)

Corporate Debt as a percent of GDP rises during periods of economic growth, and falls as the economy contracts- businesses forced to pay off debt, cut expenses, and some even go bankrupt. Now, this figure is higher than ever before- and the recent drop in the chart since 2020 **is purely semantics, as they are using gross GDP as the denominator.**

This basically means they include inflation as economic growth- GDP is the dollar value of all goods and services produced in an economy, and if prices rise, nominal (gross) GDP will rise, even if the economy is not growing at all. **The growth is only an illusion.**

**Thus, we are still likely only slightly below that 2020 level, which is well north of 50% of GDP- the height of the 2008 bubble didnt even get here. This implies that the coming downturn, if taken in full stride without a restart of QE, will be worse than 2008.**

On the housing front, real estate markets are cooling off rapidly. Rising Fed Funds rates mean that mortgage rates are rising in tandem (since almost every interest rate in our economy is calculated as some premium on top of the Fed Funds rate or a Treasury yield).

For reference, a $500k mortgage with a 50k down payment, excluding taxes, homeowners insurance, and other expenses, would cost approximately $2,037 a year ago. Now, that same mortgage costs $3,061, or 50% more. With real wages falling due to inflation rising faster than wage growth, this means that housing demand is falling rapidly.

[Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-27/hottest-us-housing-markets-now-have-bigger-share-of-price-cuts): US cities that saw some of the biggest jumps in home prices during the pandemic now have the largest shares of price cuts, according to data compiled by [Zillow Group Inc](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/ZG:US).

Overall, the proportion of active real estate listings with lower prices has increased in all 50 of the largest US metropolitan markets tracked by Zillow. In these cities, 11.5% of homes saw a price cut in May, on average, up from 8.2% a year earlier.

**Among the 50 metros in Zillows data, 32 had more than 10% of listings with a price decline. In eight cities, the share has jumped by at least 5 percentage points over the past year.**

What is even more concerning is the skyrocketing cost of mortgages. With the recent hikes in interest rates, and negative real wages gains due to inflation, US mortgage payments as percentage of income are higher than at the top of the subprime bubble.

Housing, food and energy represent inelastic goods in an economy- these are not things we want, they are things we need. An increase in these prices means less disposable income to spend on other goods - portending a fall in business revenues for firms that arent in these vital industries.

[Macro Alf on Twitter points out](https://twitter.com/MacroAlf/status/1562477584654409728/photo/1)\- Housing market trends lead economic and labor market cycles by 6-12 months. Right now, the US housing market is signalling unemployment rate will likely be above 6% in 2023: another data point which is inconsistent with a soft landing.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5unodflilhl91.png?width=1204&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=55bad74a7b5a640d289b503994fed7dccd405f3d

The US Treasury Yield Curve, a graphical representation of the yields for the most common maturity treasuries and t-bills, is currently deeply inverted. The two- to 10-year segment of the yield curve inverted in late March 2022 for the first time since 2019.

(The term [yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldcurve.asp) refers to the relationship between the short- and long-term interest rates of [fixed-income securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fixed-incomesecurity.asp) issued by the U.S. Treasury. An [inverted yield curve](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invertedyieldcurve.asp) occurs when short-term interest rates exceed long-term rates.)

Under normal circumstances, the yield curve is not inverted since debt with longer maturities typically carry higher interest rates than nearer-term ones.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vbamzx8klhl91.png?width=1708&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=abce18f3e61fb22b60cc734e0bbef59f0e3eb979

As investors fear an economic downturn, however, they begin buying longer dated maturities en masse, driving up bond prices, and therefore driving down yields on the 7 year and 10 year bonds. (recall that bond prices and bond yields are inversely correlated). This causes the 10yr yield to dip below the 2 year yield, which in a healthy market would never happen.

**The U.S. curve has inverted before each recession since 1955, with a recession following between six and 24 months, according to a** [**2018 report**](https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/el2018-20.pdf) **by researchers at the San Francisco Fed. It offered a false signal just once in that time.**

This indicator is one of the most accurate forecasters of recession- and given the depth of the inversion, the bond market is foreshadowing a much worse downturn than even the 2008 Great Financial Crisis.

(The chart below portrays the difference between the 2 year and the 10 year (this pair is often called 2s10s.) When it is positive, the 10yr yield is higher, and we have an upward sloping curve. When it is 0, the curve is flat, and when it is negative, the curve is inverted. Currently it is negative)

[Bloomberg notes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/treasury-yield-curve-inversion-has-scope-to-deepen-bofa-says): And it isnt just the US bond market thats signaling that a recession may be on the horizon. [New Zealand](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/RFJOJ0T0G1KW)s two-year yields exceeded 10-year rates for the first time since 2015 on Wednesday. The difference between Australias 10- and three-year bond futures -- its favored measure -- is at the flattest in more than a decade, while the UKs yield curve briefly inverted earlier this month.

All these worrying recession indicators hit as the US consumer is at its weakest in at least the last 40 years- [Credit card balances increased $46 billion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/08/02/credit-card-debt-inflation/) in the second quarter, a 5.5 percent increase from the first quarter, and there was also an uptick in new credit card accounts. The 13 percent increase from the second quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2022 was the biggest such jump in more than 20 years!

**People are going further into debt just to stay alive- this cant possibly be sustainable. The debt monster continues to grow.**

Joelle Scally, administrator of the Center for Microeconomic Data at the New York Fed, stated in a news release, The second quarter of 2022 showed robust increases in mortgage, auto loan, and credit card balances, driven in part by rising prices. While household balance sheets overall appear to be in a strong position, we are seeing rising delinquencies among subprime and low-income borrowers with rates approaching pre-pandemic levels.

**And to think, all this economic damage and the Fed hasnt even BEGUN to tighten! Theyve raised rates, sure- but if you check** [**this post I made a few weeks ago**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/vp8k3j/fed_purchases_423bn_usts_and_mbs_from_june_1st9th/)**, you see that the Fed has run a pathetic excuse of a tightening program.**

The Feds total assets (Balance sheet) is charted below, the beginning of the period set to early 2020. This tightening cycle is the slowest and weakest the Fed has ever undertaken.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qqaz949rlhl91.png?width=2336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=414874f2c8a7187f3a96e60785a3f88bf90808ff

Theyre using a covert method of financial engineering to slow down the taper- they were slated to do $95B a month of tapering, i.e. allowing their Treasury or MBS debt securities to mature (or sell them), and not printing more to replace them. This program would have been smaller than the QE of 2021, which saw $120B a month of liquidity added to the system.

But they arent even following through with their own plan. The accounting gimmick results from them using a loophole to reinvest funds back into Treasuries or MBS.

Understandably, the Fed, with its massive holdings of bonds, receives interest payments monthly. These payments were usually written off in previous tightening cycles (literally the Fed can go into their central account and delete their own deposits from the system).

**This time, theyre using the billions of interest each month to plow back into new Treasuries or MBS. This isnt printing money technically they argue, since no new bank reserves are being created- rather they are just recycled from the existing system.**

**Either way, the Fed is not tightening at the proposed $95B a month pace, rather they have drawn their balance sheet down about $100B since April, four months ago- this is 25% of where we should be if the taper was being run correctly.**

Even the incompetent administrators on the Open Market Desk at the Fed must know that if they truly taper, and destroy the trillions in easy money they pumped into the system, the entire edifice will fall. The economy is already headed toward severe recession, the Eurozone is collapsing from an energy crisis turning into a full blown inflationary crisis, and layoffs are beginning to spread through the American economy.

If they destroyed the excess liquidity that was pumped in the system, I believe a New Great Depression would begin within months. Stocks would collapse, the Federal Government would default on debts, and millions of businesses would fail. Their very credibility would be threatened, and the people might drive them out of power.

Our debt to GDP is higher now than even the peak of the 1930s and 1940s, during the last zenith of the debt super-cycle. Further, the consumer is at record loan to income, with credit card, mortgage, and auto loan balances surging in Q2. The American middle class simply cannot withstand more debt.

**They are consigned to walk a tightrope, on one side the perilous deflationary spiral, and the other the burning inferno of inflation. They must hike rates, but they cant taper- they must get stocks to come down, but not too much- they must induce recession, but not depression. It is a virtually impossible task.**

**Fed officials walk this rope because they themselves created it- with the years of zero bound interest rates, infinite liquidity, and permanent bailout facilities such as Standing Repo, they created a sick, distorted version of our original financial system.**

**The economic cognoscenti have opened the door into the Upside Down- a mirror dimension where nothing is quite as it seems. Weve never traveled to this dimension at any other point in financial history - so we cant even discern the difference between it and normalcy.**

**This is a strange place- where inflation bankrupts America while the Dollar soars on foreign exchange; markets rally as jobless claims rise; and the Almighty Fed is the only indicator to watch.**

**Markets should be down 35% here and trending lower, CDS spreads should break out, credit markets should be in absolute bloodbath, and yet, here we are- markets are down, but not too much, inflation is under control, and the definition of recession itself is changing! (**[**see this**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2022/07/21/how-do-economists-determine-whether-the-economy-is-in-a-recession/)**)**

**Perhaps they are missing something- maybe there is Demogorgon lurking deep in the tunnels.**

**Mad with hunger, he is ready to rend flesh and bone asunder**

**His talons might reach across the nation, poisoning everything he touches, as he squats in the shadows**

**His tendrils spread, infecting new victims and sickening the rest**

**He feeds on rates, and lives on time**

**Every day and every hour the interest accrues; the debt accumulates,**

**Imagine the world economy as an armada of ships passing through a narrow and dangerous strait leading to the sea of prosperity. Navigating the channel is treacherous- err too far to one side and your ship plunges off the waterfall of deflation; but too close to the other and it burns in the hellfire of inflation.** The global fleet is tethered by chains of trade and investment so if one ship veers perilously off course it pulls the others with it.

Our only salvation is to hoist our economic sails and harness the winds of innovation and productivity. It is said that de-leveraging is a perilous journey and beneath these dark waters are many a sunken economy of lore. **Print too little money and we cascade off the waterfall like the Great Depression of the 1930s... print too much and we burn like the Weimar Republic Germany in the 1920s...** fail to harness the trade winds and we sink like Japan in the 1990s.

Im a gay man in my late 40s who has always kept his romantic life private at work. Because I dont talk about who Im dating most of my coworkers assume Im single which Im fine with. Im not friends with coworkers either so we dont chill outside of work. Thats how I like it.  I was at work one day, minding my own business at my desk, when a coworker that I have never particularly liked because I find her incompetent and annoying suddenly turns to me and asks, Is it tough being completely alone at your age? I said, Excuse me?? My private life is none of your business and is not open for discussion, to which she replied, I didnt mean anything bad by it.  Im just saying it must be hard being single at your age. Im sure the pandemic has made dating difficult, and its only getting worse, huh? Is that why you got Duke (my new puppy)? I paused and just stared at her taking in what she just said.  Ive worked with this woman for over a decade. She is only a year younger than me, recently pregnant, and is going on maternity leave very soon. Most in the office think she wont come back due to the fact that shell be a new mom at 45. We have a cordial professional relationship and never share our private lives with each other. So for her to not only over step this boundary but to say something so insulting made me fire back. Knowing how sensitive she is about entering motherhood at her age, I responded to her, Is it tough knowing that when people see you theyll think youre the babys grandmother?.  The color drained from her face. I later learned she was crying in the break room. I felt like she was trying to create some shit with me before she left. I have no idea. The only reason I can think of is that she has unexpressed long standing resentment for me and felt she can say something now that shes leaving.  It was a childish exchange of insults that should not have happened. Believe me, Im not thrilled with myself for attacking a woman for the way she looks.

My dad is a well-known psychiatrist who relies on older, paper-based methods to keep his patients files organized - as a result he has hired secretaries over the years to help him manage the volume of his work. After working full 8 hour days, he will work for another several hours to complete notes and prepare letters in lieu of docs and emails. For the past 10 years, he has been working closely with his secretary Lana and this has brought them exceedingly close.

My dad has always lamented his children - though he forms these comments as jokes, he will bemoan the fact he has no sons, no one listens to him, no one does what he wants, no one does the chores corrects, his children are brats that ask him for everything so dont as [him] for NOTHING. When he saw my interest in computer science help in creating powerpoints for him, retrieving docs, organizing, etc - but once it became apparent I did not want to do so for free, he decided to turn to Lana to do these tasks (im not sure what she was doing before truthfully). 

He is very much the person who will conveniently forget a persons existence should they not have some sort of value to them. We drifted apart, he continued to complain, I thought this was a normal family dynamic.

I went to college. Lana had a son, and in my fathers eyes it made her irreplaceable - finally a male in the house he could dote on! I loved her son, he was a happy baby - but it made Lana bolder. I was sent home to live with my parents during the pandemic and wanted to return, she attempted to persuade me it was too expensive for my parents, to the point where I questioned directly whether I should continue my education. Im grateful to have ignored her.

My dad admitted to me he did not want to retire due to the fact he was worried Lana would not find a job that would pay as much for her skills as he did. He asked me Do you want to know how much I pay her? $27/hr. 

It stuck with me, I wasnt sure why until I realized later on the price it genuinely symbolized: $27/hr to have a daughter already raised for you, already married and a stable career - the convenience of it fitting my father in every essence of the idea.

 Raising his own children was too difficult, we were provided to college-age nannies to hush us and heard us away from his office whilst he played with model trains. The emotional toll of listening to your crying child was too much, hire a doctor weeks later to poke the kid until they say something that can be diagnosed and drugged. Attempting to hold serious discussions was too much, print off a magazine article and toss it at the kids door and hope they read it but dont actually engage. The burden of merely teaching children why basic hygiene was important was lost to the man, because to a doctor who worked with children, to ask why? was equivalent to questioning his authority.

Truth be told, if he wanted a daughter - he already had one for free. But it was more convenient to simply buy another one already premade. Writing this has put me more at peace with the strangeness of it all- but hey, Im free in more ways than one now, I hope.","TrueOffMyChest",5353,5353,0,0.97,0,0,0,295

**I want to share my happiness with you. I landed my dream job and apartment and I can finally leave my cheating husband**

Husband 39 and I 35 met 10 years ago. He was up until last year the love of my life. He was my rock and I his. We shared the same interests, humor and views. We also were childfree. 

I owned a little sandwich shop that was fairly popular near huge office buildings. I loved my job and I was so content. I made good living. My husband is an engineer.

When covid hit and people started working from home, my business went down pretty quickly and by the fall of 2020 I had to close for good. I still did some catering gigs but not near enough to have a decent source of income. My husband said that I shouldnt be worried because he could support both of us. I went back to college, HR management, a 3 years program. 

Around the same time as all that happened my husband confessed to me that he might have changed his mind about being childfree, something that I had noticed before he confessed. I loved my husband very much and I had started noticing him around friends and family members who have small children (he was so adorable) and to be honest without my very hectic job I also started thinking the same. 

We had our son November last year. The best thing that ever happened to me, but just 3 weeks after I gave birth my husband came to me and confessed that he cheated on me. It felt like the ground opened from under me. How could that be possible? He was my love and I was his& wasnt I? He apologized and tried to blame it on the pandemic, on being bored at home on being scared to be a father on midlife crisis. He loved me and he didnt want to lose me. I felt so trapped with a small baby that needed me, no job and no place to go. Good job hubby, you sure knew when to deliver this blow! A week later he asked me what I thought about opening the marriage. Humans arent meant to stay monogamous and while he still loved me more than anything in the world he didnt find me enough. I started crying and begged him not to humiliate me. If he just gave me some time, we could divorce and go our separate ways. He said he wasnt interested in divorce. He didnt want to replace me. Just add some new excitement into our relationship.

Two weeks later he came home with her and told me that shes moving in with us. A 26 years old that he met at work. He started showing her the apartment and explained how important it was for me to have everything clean and tidy all the time and that she should abide by that. She was smiling the whole time. He took her to the guest bedroom. Shes been living with us ever since. 

I moved to my sons room and put locks on and Ive been living with my baby for almost a year now. Rarely existing in the common areas beside preparing for my catering gigs. The GF moved eventually into my bedroom with my husband. He warned me that this would happen if I refused to move back. Funny how we can adjust so fast and find small pleasures even in the most difficult times. Having my baby and seeing him grow has been my biggest comfort, him and my studies. After a few months my husband gave up trying to talk to me outside of matters concerning our son. He finally realized neither fighting , tantrums nor love bombing worked on me and most importantly he stopped trying to get intimate with me, beside the occasional I love you or I miss you text sometimes a sext while hes literally on the other side of the wall. His GF kept her distance from me and I was thankful for that. She moved out a few times after they would fight . I dont know the details but I would guess that she wanted exclusivity (oh, the irony). she always showed up again after a couple of days. I acted like I didnt notice any of it.

I have one year left of my studies but after my internship (practicing semester) at a big firm, my boss offered me a paid internship. Its a full time job starting in January. It would mean work and study full time but I know that I will manage!  Im just so happy. This means that I now have the means to find my own place and I did. A small studio (32m ²). Im moving November 1. 

I will have to break the news eventually to my husband that Im moving out and filing for divorce. I dont want to tell him right now but once I start packing he will probably understand anyway. I dont know what his reaction would be. Ideally he would be relieved but somehow I doubt it. Right now he thinks Im bound to him for at least another year because of my studies and hes still acting like Im his wife. I have been so lucky this far and hopefully my moving out and divorce wont be any different. I havent been this happy in many months and I wanted to share it somewhere since nobody in my surrounding knows what I have gone through.

**I got my apartment. I move out and left my husband and his girlfriend. I'm free**

gosh! I don't even know where to start. Maybe thank you for supporting me on my last post (beside the few worthless ""why don't you just leave"" comments), I just wanted to vent and share my story but many of you have requested an update after I have moved.

I got the keys to my little apartment 2 weeks ago because the previous tenant move out earlier. I was grateful because I wanted to paint the room and do some makeover. I talked to the landlady and ended up telling her my whole story. lol. She promised me he next two bedroom that becames available. When I got the keys I felt that I could finally breathe. I'm not on good terms with my family but I ended up telling them what's been going on in my life this past year and my friends too. I don't know why I kept this a secret for so long. Maybe because I was too ashamed or embarrassed, or maybe because I had a definite plan and I didn't want outside influence or distraction. I didn't want my best friend to feel obligated to host me. I didn't want my sister to ask if *""I could forgive him""*, or my in-laws to try and *""change his mind""*. So the best thing I knew was to keep quiet and act like everything was normal.

I moved last Friday. I had packed all my kitchen gear and my sons and my clothes, toys etc while my husband was at work. My best friend and her husband helped me. I didn't take any of the furniture because I thought it could wait until we divorced and I requested division of property. I have no room for anything in my little apartment anyway. When my husband came home I told him that I was leaving. He was confused at first but I told him about my new apartment so he asked me how I was going to afford it. His facial expression changed and he looked scared. He started telling me how he has been regretting all of what he did. He loved and missed me. He knew that he messed up and has been thinking that this wasn't what he wanted. He wanted his family back. Our son and me. He asked me if I wanted my baby not to have his parents together then he said that he was leaving his girlfriend and she would be moving out and it could be the two of us again. His girlfriend started fighting with him and I just left.

He has now been calling me asking to see us. I still want a decent coparenting relationship with him so he took our son on Sunday to his parents' to spend time with him. This is the first time I'm without my son a whole day. I cried the entire time. I need to get used to this. My in-laws apologized for what my husband did. I think they think this is going to pass and we will be back together. I think everybody think that beside my best friend. I won't try to convince them. Let time tell them instead.

My feelings are letting me down now. After all he did, I still love him with all my heart and I miss him, his kisses his eyes, the way he looks at and touches me. How weird is that? I don't know if this is good or bad. I don't know if these feelings will disappear and what they will be replaced with. Hate? Is harboring hate for a man I'm bound to for at least 17 more years something good? Maybe I should use my love for him to create a better coparenting relationship. Maybe I should not stop loving him just find a new meaning for this love. Our son is so much like him especially his smile. It makes it even harder not to think about or miss him. This past year I have not had time to reflect over my feelings. I've done a great job being matter of fact(ual?) and surpress my feelings, but now I'm on my own in my own apartment I can finally cry and mourn they love that we lost. And the weirdest thing is that I really believe that he still loves me too. In his own weird way. I don't think he ever stopped loving me. I have watched him with his girlfriend for a year now. It's never like how he was with me when we were happy. The only times I could see his old loving self was when he looked at our son or at me when he thought I couldn't see him. When I think of this I cry even more because what a waste of a beautiful relationship and for what?

My son's birthday is in a few days. I feel so guilty but I will not be celebrating it with my husband. my son is still too young to remember so I won't be hurting him. Hopefully when he is older, my husband and I are on better terms so we can celebrate him together but for now I'm doing a party with my family and friends and my husband can do a party for him if he wanted.

I just wanted to say something before I leave. Last time many accused me of being too dependent. Letting my husband taking care of me and our son. I thought this is how life/love/partnership was supposed to be. I had a very respectable business and I loved my job. I was happy and content. I had a loving and supportive husband. We bought our beautiful place and renovated it from scratch with our (BOTH) hard earned money. I never foresaw the pandemic and how my business would suffer. How my life would be turned upside down and when it did, I thought I could rely on my husband because that's what people supposed to do. If the roles were reversed I would gladly have supported him until he got on his feet again. Because in the long run the whole family would reap the benefits. So no, I wasn't dependent, I thought I had a good safety net. If you still don't understand that people no matter where they are in life could fall and need to start over, expecting their loved ones to support them or at least not take advantage of them. If you still don't understand that this doesn't mean that they're weak then there's nothing more I could say to explain myself so I'll leave it at that.

**[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/hhroia/my_mom_turned_her_guest_room_into_a_nursery_after/) June 29, 2020**

I am currently pregnant with my first child and both my mom and step dad have been terrible to me and my partner the entire time. Told us we would be unfit parents because we arent married yet, legitimately screamed at my partner for ""knocking up their little girl"" even though we planned the pregnancy. They would call him everyday and harass him, and showing up to his work. Try to convince him to leave me so I would have no choice but to move back in with them. It got worse as time went on. I finally decided to cut contact with them. Having a child can already be a stressful time and having them around to make it worse was not something i was okay with. My partner and I have gone through a lot with family drama the past couple years and having this baby has been one of the most exciting things for us. If my parents cant be nice to my partner then they dont get to see our baby. Plus they are the kind of people who dont wear masks in public and actively choose to be in large gatherings with no social distancing, so them seeing a newborn is out of the question. One day I sent my mom a very detailed email of why she is not allowed to be apart of my life anymore and will not be seeing her grandchild. To make things even better, I also noted that we will be moving across the country shortly after she is born to be closer to other family members.

So not only is she cut off, but we are literally moving far away and never coming back.

She responds by showing up at our house at 11pm screaming outside our door about how it is her baby and she deserves to be there for it. I tell her to fuck off and eventually she leaves.

Months go by and she will text me randomly asking about technical problems with her wifi router or something and needs help. Little things like that don't mean much to me and I sent her the info she needed. My cousin also had a virtual baby shower and sent my invitation to my moms house accidentally so my mom came by to give it to me. Things slowly came to a point that we were fairly amicable with each other but I still stood my ground about our boundaries and nothing else had changed. She knew this.

Then she sends me a video today that blew my mind. She redecorated her entire guest room to be a nursery. Crib, changing table, $400 worth of newborn clothes, toy chest, stroller, a car seat for her car, and the list goes on. In the video she is in tears saying ""omg I can't believe my baby is going to be here soon, this is where she will sleep, where I will change her little diapers, these will be her toys"".

Is she psychotic!? HER baby?? Sleeping and living at HER house?? What!?

So I call her up immediately and I reiterate that we are still moving across the country soon and that she will have no contact with the baby before that. Her response? ""Oh okay we will see about that!""

Genuinely confused. What part of ""you will have no contact with this baby"" does she not understand or thinks will change in the next few weeks when she is born? Is she planning on stealing her from us? I am at a loss for words.

Edit: Wow so many great tips from you guys! Thank you for the advice, I showed my partner the comments I have been getting and I think we are starting to take this more seriously and will be contacting a lawyer on Monday. I wanted to mention a couple things to clarify as well:

I have been seeing a psychotherapist the past few months strictly due to the relationship I have had with my mother throughout my life and all of that is documented. My midwife and hospital is also very aware of the situation and the emotional stress I have been going through. So we will definitely be utilizing this in the case that she tries to sue us or call CPS. Also, due to the virus, only my partner is allowed to be with me during the birth anyway. We will be keeping things hush until after we move.

We would have moved months ago if it was financially possible for us. We also spent a lot of money on my birth center here that is non refundable. She is due in August and our lease ends in September. We already have everything set up to move, and our other family is helping us out, just a waiting game at this point.

My partner is my power of attorney if something happens to me during the birth

We are currently in a state that is against grandparents rights. The only way she would be able to sue for visitation is if both myself and my partner were deceased. Even after we move, she still cannot file for GPS if she is living in this state

This is an update to my previous post mom turns room into a nursery after I told her she would never meet my baby

Backstory: My mom and I have not spoken for many months now. My entire pregnancy she was terrible to me and my partner and because of that I told her she would not be seeing her grandchild (whom she liked to call HER baby) . On top of that, we would be moving across the country to be closer to other family. Her response was we will see about that and then proceeded to build a nursery in her room filled to the brim with baby essentials.

So I gave birth about a week ago at home and my partner and I are so happy with our new addition. We have been quarantined since the second she was born and our pediatrician recommended for us to keep the baby home for at least 2 months to keep her safe from the virus.

My mom calls me after the birth crying about how upset she is that I didnt invite her to be present for the birth and also to congratulate me on giving birth to her baby. Then asks when she can come see her. My partner and I, along with the consult of a lawyer, agreed that my mother could see her 1 time through a car window. Though there would be no touching or holding of any kind. Just a simple viewing. So I told her this and her response was that she would let me know when shes available and then hasnt said a word to me all week after. Which works for me because I didnt want her to see the baby anyway, we just wanted to give her a chance.

This morning I get a voicemail from her asking to go on a resort trip for the weekend. I am absolutely baffled by this. What is going on in her mind?? I dont even know what to say.

There is still a pandemic and we are quarantining with the baby
I literally just gave birth a few days ago
We havent spoken in months and all of a sudden she expects me to just go on a vacation with her?
She is not allowed to see the baby. Even if she just wanted me to go, Im not leaving my newborn
Im not going to take the baby away from her father for that long just so my mom can hang out with her
We are set to move as soon as Im cleared by my midwife. I am not responding to my mother and Im starting to think that she is either seriously trying to manipulate me or is just not right in the head. Probably a mix of both. I gave her a chance to see the baby on my terms and she didnt take it so thats her loss.

I have a bad relationship with my mother to say the least. She has been terrible to my partner and I my entire pregnancy. I wrote an update about the things she was doing (like building a nursery in her room when I told her she wasnt going to see my baby) a few days ago but I finally got a response from her regarding the 1 viewing we were going to allow for her and I just had to post about it. Due to the virus our pediatrician recommended that we quarantine the newborn for 2 months. My mother knew this, I told her many times. She refused to stay home, to get tested, to wear masks, or do anything really. Its her way or the highway in her mind, but not in reality. And boy did she get a wake up call today. As of recently, I gave her the opportunity to view the baby through a car window. She seemed fine with it and said she would let me know when she was available. She was abiding to my boundaries? Quite shocking. Then 2 weeks pass and I hear nothing from her. Until this morning. She asks me when she can see her baby and that its almost been 3 weeks and she hasnt held her. I laugh. I knew this was going to happen. I tell her she is in quarantine and no one but me and her dad can touch her. That she can see her through a window or not at all. She responds I think Ill pass on the window, let me know when I can hold my baby. I laugh again. This woman will not stop! Im fed up! My pregnancy hormones are gone, my baby is here, we are moving away in a matter of weeks and she will never find us, if she thinks she has any power here she is dead wrong. So I send one last message to her and say okay no window then, maybe when shes 18 she will reach out to you. Andddd blocked!

I currently dont speak to my mother, nor have I for many months now. But somehow she still finds ways to butt into my life and the decisions I make for my child.

My husband and I both come from anti-vaxx families. His side is against it but doesnt shame us for vaccinating our daughter. My mother, however, really has a lot to say about it. Since we both were raised to not believe in science, it was pretty natural for us to be against vaccinating our daughter when she was born. I had a home birth so it was easy to avoid everything. We would lie to pediatricians about it and just did what our parents did when we were kids. But since the new vaccine for covid was released, I started to consider getting it and decided to do some actual research on vaccines as a whole. My husband and I made the decision to get vaccinated as well as getting a schedule started for our 6 month old baby to catch her up. We went in this morning to get her first shots. Everything went smoothly and so far she seems fine. She has been fussy and sleepier than usual but the pediatrician said thats normal and will go away in a day or 2.

We left feeling proud that we were able to educate ourselves effectively and set our baby up for success.

Then I get a call. Its my grandpa. Or so I thought.

I answer and the first thing I hear is When you wake up and she isnt breathing, youll be sorry!! I cant believe you did this to MY little girl!

I hang up immediately and start to panic. I eventually traced it back to a family member that is a doctor. I was asking her questions about vaccines and I told her we were going in today. I guess she told my grandpa how excited she was for us and then he told my mom and then BOOM, end of the world!

My MIL found out later and seemed supportive, given her opinions about vaccines. She told us its your decision, and I trust that whatever you do is what is best for her. So Im glad we have her to help reassure us a bit. But now Ive been getting texts and calls from my mom, through my grandpas phone, absolutely freaking out. Saying that she hopes something happens to her so I will see the consequences of my actions. Also that she is praying for her, whatever that means.

Ultimately, we are confident with our decision and will continue with her schedule. Although, at times we do question if we made the right decision. Im sure everything will be fine. But my mother seriously needs to chill out!","BestofRedditorUpdates",5207,5207,0,0.97,0,0,0,307

Dear AAM,

We had a pandemic baby and we decided for safety reasons it was better to be exposed to one person (a nanny) versus the potentially hundreds in a daycare setting. The expense for even 40 hours of her time is a tight squeeze for us, but weve found someone who is overall fantastic. Our baby does amazing with her, shes knowledgeable, experienced, helpful, and taking the kinds of precautions we need and expect.

I manage people at work but have never had in-home help until now, and I have no role models for this because we are just not of an income bracket where Ive ever been around nannies. She feels different than someone I would manage at work because the lines blur a lot  shes in our home, caring for our baby, eating lunch with us, etc. We also cant afford to lose her  there just arent that many folks who fit our needs out there right now.

The issue is this. Shes lost some serious weight. Im talking 100+ pounds, and shes still going. I am happy for her because she seems happy about it, and I understand the commitment a change like that takes  it can be all-consuming. That said, she comments on every single food we eat and bring into our house, and not favorably. While we eat reasonably healthfully and are active and healthy weights, we do have junk food in our house and not every meal is perfectly balanced and nutritious. As a working mom, my priority is first ease and second cost. Nutrition matters, too, but its definitely not the only consideration. Also, we have a new baby in a pandemic! Every night I cook at all feels heroic and we eat some treats only because theyre tasty.

Ive tried hinting, We eat everything in moderation here or We want to teach \[baby\] that foods arent good or bad, and all bodies are good bodies and finally, I cant really talk about food and weight this much; its not healthy for me. She doesnt get it.

I sort of lost it when I saw her snap a photo of our snack drawer presumably to show someone what pigs we are but I didnt say anything because I needed to work.

How do I address this in a way that puts a stop to it, is blunt enough to be clear, but doesnt sour our relationship and make things awkward? If I were in an office, Id know what to do but Im honestly at a loss here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Update** 

So, I really appreciated the commenters perspectives about the opportunity costs involved  in finding a nanny during COVID and finding trusted, qualified childcare in general. I also appreciated your feedback about jumping to termination without really HAVING this conversation.

I had a conversation with her where I said, essentially, that the focus on our food choices felt uncomfortable for me. She was honestly very vulnerable in sharing that she was able to lose so much weight by simply never giving herself access to any treats and being in our home was very disorienting to her. She definitely had some fears that she was projecting, and I probably also had some insecurities that didnt mix well there. After talking, she definitely was able to reflect and see how this came across, and we talked about shared expectations around food. I mentioned that I would be happy to keep any treats she found inordinately distracting out of line-of-sight and away from the foods she and the baby were accessing. I also mentioned that I would always include her in our grocery and meal planning and make sure we had options that were appealing to her and fit her goals, per your recommended script. We also talked about food/body/diet talk around the baby as she became more verbal and she really seemed to understand. We also talked about photos taken in our home and parameters for sharing them, as well as just discussing our family with anyone else. It did turn out that the photos she took were so she could investigate how they fit into her diet, something she didnt want to spend time doing at work. I have not seen her do that again.

We dont always execute this perfectly, but I think that conversation set a good baseline and we can return to those mutually agreeable principles whenever this is out of alignment. Shes been an amazing nanny and I would hate to have made a hasty decision based on behavior I didnt fully understand. Things are going really well! So thankful for your support and perspective as well as the readers.

Anxiety, low selfsteem, lack of confidence... we used to stay hours on the phone talking about life, each other's traumas and that created a very strong bond between us.

We started dating soon after and got even closer. She saw me quitting my job to pursue my dream, I helped her overcome her insecurities and we never had a fight, every issue was addressed, everything talked through and nothing was hidden. There was no jealousy, no lack of confidence in each other.

That was it, the real deal, right? So, three years in a fairytale of a relationship, I proposed. 

Everyday we got closer and everything was building up to be the perfect wedding, same dreams, same goals, same mindset. Our sex life, on the other hand, took a hit. Her anxiety was pilling up, because of her former career. She decided to quit and we moved abroad, so we could both restart our newly wedded life on a fresh new place. 

Man, did she grow up during the last 4 years living here. From a scary girl filled with traumas from past abusive relationships to a full on woman, owner of her life. But something started messing with her from the inside out. Trying to build a career as an artist and having to do it during a pandemic didn't help. Being away from her big family neither. And we never actually solved the sex life issue completely.

All her psychologic conditions can be traced back to her father and to a life-long-internet-friend-became-boyfriend who fucked up her head for over a decade of psychological abuse. The same guy who, after 7 years in the dark, decided to send her an e-mail just to ""check if she was actually happy and not only following her life without him"".

Of course, being the couple we were, she disclosed that to me, said they were talking and that she was finally having some closure on some issues. Asked my position about it and I was honest, I didn't like the idea, but as long as she didn't talk about us and felt it was serving a purpose, I could live with it. And, as expected, after a few days she told me she was done talking to him.

That was in the beginning of December/21. That month was brutal, we both worked our asses off, long ours, crossed shifts, never felt so distant, but was for a great cause. We were talking about finally, after two years delay, buying a house and having kids. Our biggest dream. To worsen things up, she had COVID symptoms and isolated 7 days. We spend Christmas together. I had COVID a few days later and isolated another 7 days.

January 4th, after a weird distance between us since new years eve, she said she was moving back to her parents. She couldn't live here anymore, she was losing the growning up of her five nephews, she could lose her 89 and 96 years old grandmothers at anytime and couldn't afford to be way any longer. She have a ticket for March/18th, because she was already going to her cousin's wedding, but now she woudn't come back. She also said that she can't ask me to throw away what I build here to go with her, because that would be unfair. She know she can't be happy here, and I will be unhappy there (I won't say which, but our country sucks in every aspect for any one trying to live a decent, honest life and build a family and it was one of the main reasons why we moved abroad).

Today, after two months of couples counseling and being able to accept there's nothing else I can do about it and that she needs to live this and figure out what is that she's really feeling, after two months helping her out with whatever she needs to make this moment the least painful for us both, I unwillingly caught a notification on her phone ""hey baby, sorry I just woke up"" - That Guy. Then, I willingly opened the message (we have full access, because there was trust), and I saw everything I shouldn't. 

I love you. Getting back together. Talking about me. Some very hardcore sexting. Him calling her his woman and me her ex-husband. And, of course, already a few signs of psychologic play from his part.

Everything went down the drain and now I see a stranger living in my home. And I alone.

EDIT: Thank you for so much kind words. I'm going to talk to her today at the first opportunity and let her tell me her truth. Even though I don't think I can believe her or trust her, she earned it after the last 8 wonderfull years. I'm trying not to judge her on her worst mistake, and thanks to you, I'm learning a lot about abuse victims and limerence. I'll look after myself from now on. And I'll be back to let you know how things went

When I was a sixteen year old, I was stupid, I didnt wear protection and I got a girl pregnant. I was shocked, I never expected having a kid that early and I dont know if I regret it or not. Almost all of my regrets washed away when my son was born.


For privacy purposes we will call him Rory. I am 24 now and my son is seven almost eight now. He is the smartest and most loving kid I could ever ask for. His mom had left when he was around two, when I tried to sue for child support the judge sided with her quoting that I was the father and needed to step up. Ever since then it has been me and Rory against the world.


I was a single dad to Rory from then on. I had a few girlfriends but nothing serious. I left my parents place and got a small apartment. I dropped out of high school which I still immensely regret, but hey, life happens. During this time, my neighbors, (God bless them) helped me raise my son. They were an older couple next-door whos kids had moved out long before, so they were fine babysitting him after school, late shifts etc.


I am a manager at McDonalds. I make lousy money but it was enough to get by, then two years prior our shitty building manager raised the rent for everyone and I had to work even harder for a place to live during a pandemic. My parents had left the state and I wasnt ready to uplift my kids entire life because his dad couldnt provide for him.


Every birthday, since before he was three I believe, I took Rory to golden coral usually on his birthday but there were more occasions we went, It was really good for him and he really enjoyed it. I havent been able to take him for the past two years due to money being very tight. (This is important for later)


Sometimes I will get tipped at McDonalds, a quarter here, a dime here, a dollar here and there. Ill bring it him everyday and give it to Rory to save. Well two days ago, Rory brings me his money jug and dumps it all out in-front of me. He was so excited and began counting it out. There was around forty dollars there and he jumped up excitedly. I had asked him whats up little buddy.


When I tell you guys my heart broke, my son asked me if it was enough to go to the corral for his birthday. A piece of me shattered inside, I didnt think he remembered the Golden Corral. I told him we couldnt go to the bank tomorrow and exchange it for cash. That night I ugly cried in my bedroom. I felt like a failure because I couldnt give him everything hes ever wanted. Ive began researching furthering my education.


Well yesterday as soon as the bank opened, I took my son and we exchanged the money for cash. I then drove us to Golden Corral and we were there for two hours. My kid was so happy, and I was stupid because I just assumed he forgot this place. (We get the all you can eat buffet for 2 for 30$) Today I cried again in my room. Ive never been good at saving money, but his birthday is next month and Im gonna do my best to take him every few months.


So other parents of reddit, Can I ask some advice of how you deal with the guilt of having to say no? (Again this is a happy tifu)


Edit 1: also if anyone asks, Ill post a pic of the coins and the container they were in. He saved them in a Cotten candy container from a Christmas ago =


Edit 2: kids money jug and his coins posted on my profile lol!! Thats for those who asked. I would post a pic of him blurred but thats violating his privacy


Edit 3: OMG thanks for the gold! This is my first across my two accounts P=Q


Edit 4: 3 gold! WOW now I wish I wouldve posted this on my main lol


Edit 5: turning off dms and replies because Im getting a lot of trolls. Hope everyone has a great day. Thank you so much for your parenting advice d


Edit 6: 6 gold 2 platinum OMFG thank you, I will be giving awards to top comments d


Edit 7: 9 gold and 4 platinum THIS IS INSANE!!!


TLDR; Kid saved for months just to treat us to Golden Corral because I couldnt afford to take him in two years, I ugly cried thinking he didnt remember

I just wanna thank everyone for the massive support, I didnt know it also went viral on Facebook and tiktok and I was shocked. Its been around two days since my initial post and Ive done a few things :D. (This will likely be the last post to this account)


Regarding everyones advice, I thank you for telling me that its okay to say no. I never want to say no to my boy and Its been difficult to do that but I understand he needs that in order to be a good kid. For everyone commenting on how young I am/was when I had my kid and why I did or didnt push for an abortion or adoption. I was a terrified sixteen year old, but I seen the look on my babies face when he first looked at me and I knew I was a parent.


To give more context, my ex, my child, and I lived with my parents until my ex left when my child was two. Ergo court, parents moving etc. It was difficult but it helped me grow up quickly. I also want to speak about a comment that really touched my heart. There was this comment telling me how I am so mature when I am only a child myself. I still see myself as a kid sometimes haha. I love spongebob like my son. I am still scared of some childish things (WILL NEVER TELL) and I am still very young. Responsibly aged me quick as it does a lot of young parents.


I do wanna have more kids someday, just not now, I wouldnt push that much struggle on my son. I couldnt handle another child at this point. However, I would love to find a girlfriend and settle down, Ive had a few flings but most were turned off by the fact I had a kid. I dont blame them, Its understandable. Maybe after I get my degree ill be more serious. AND OH YEAH.


Ive began applying for online colleges, and if Im accepted into one I plan to take a bachelors degree in business for its whats required for a regional manager for Mcdonalds. I also think this is where some people got confused, I got a G.E.D through the McDonalds education program. Ive had so much help with my kid, and I am so thankful for everyone who helped me get to where I am now. To my parents and my co-workers, to my neighbors and to my boy who molded me into the man I am now.


Ive also began looking at other apartments for me and my kid, Before the rent raised we were actually living decently. It will definitely help out on easing my financial problems.


I know I got hundreds of messages and comments telling me to go after the judge and my ex, but I seriously dont need that stress and toxicity in my life again. I wish the best for my kids mom, I dont agree with her choice to abandon us, but I understand it. She was just as dumb as I was at sixteen, she was just a kid too. So as much as I would love to hate her I cant.


This will be my last update, sorry for information being everywhere. I will try to respond to everyone who comments. But thank you all for such an amazing experience on this subreddit. I thank the mods too because I edited my last post too many times and it got locked LOL and they had to manually unlock it! So thanks guys!!!


Also I told Rory about the reddit post and how famous he is now and hes rather happy as a eight year can be haha.


Edit 1: I ALSO have a crap ton of the Reddit credits now, so I will try to award all comments LOL, 1.8 years of Reddit premium =>Â


TLDR; I am researching online colleges for a degree to get a promotion at my job, I am also gonna be apartment searching for a cheaper option to ease the stress on my finances.

 Me (F) and my wife, Jessi (F) had our daughter 2 years ago. 

Jessi is a smoker, she doesn't smoke a lot, but she consumes 2/3 a day.

 She wanted to be the one who got pregnant and I told her that she couldn't smoke at any point in the pregnancy and only after our baby stopped breastfeeding, she could start consuming again. She agreed.

 I'm against smoking, I don't smoke, but it doesn't bother me that much other people smoke and to my delight, Jessi was never a person who smelled like cigarettes despite being a smoker. The reason I'm against it's that my father died of lung cancer and guess what, he smoked. 

When our daughter was born, I managed to stay at home for 1 year and 3 months, because it hit the pandemic and home office, so we could both take care of it. Jessi also took advantage of the home office (same company, I'm in a higher position). When our company asked for employees to come back from the home office, we decided that we didn't want to put her in child-care  yet and we decided together that I would come back and she would quit to stay at home all the time. 

Currently, we have a fair division of tasks at home, when I get home from work I take care of our daughter so she can rest and 2 days a week, part time, I work at home so as not to overload (I know she stays overwhelmed, but I try to help). 

Recently, our daughter weaned and Jessi came to talk to me that she wanted to finally start smoking again, I said that I  wouldn't pay for them, but I pay for everything. I even proposed to rearrange my schedule in case she wanted to do some freelancer (she's also a designer), but I wouldn't give her the money. Thr cigarettes are my limit.

 She was annoyed saying that we agreed on her being SAHM and that I would provide financially for the family, including her expenses and I am going behind our agreed (I never paid/would pay for a cigarette of hers and she has known this for years).

 She's still mad at me, saying I'm using being the breadwinner to not let her smoke and forcing her to look for another way to earn money to buy something she wants. 

I don't know if I'm wrong, but cigarettes are a choice and a bad addiction, I don't feel comfortable paying for it, given my family history. 

AITA?

#Calm down people, I disappeared because I had to solve other things and I have a daughter, I didn't expect this to explode. 

#Extra:
1. I always made it very clear that I would never pay for a cigarette. When we made the decision for her to be SAHM, I told her I wouldn't feel right paying for her cigarette and she reassured me that it was something I wouldn't have to worry about. 

2. I couldn't put it in the post, but she does freelance to make some purchases she wants. There are months when we are tighter and we can't do some shopping, so she does freelancing, it's rare but it happens and on those days, our daughter stays with me even if it's at my service. I never limited any of her purchases, ever, if not because of tight money. 

3. For more extravagant purchases of hers that I can't afford, she freelances and buys, so I suggested she do one a month that covers her entire cigarette stash and I would help by staying with our daughter.

4. She is not entirely financially dependent on me, when she wants to buy something that I can't afford with our * (ops, my mistake) money, she makes a design request","AmItheAsshole",4812,4812,0,0.92,1,0,3,1824

I was friends with this guy for a couple of years and my wife was infertile, and was devastated we couldn't have kids. So they gave us the baby and life was good until the pandemic hit. The pandemic hit hard for us and my wife lost her job. Thankfully, I got a better job and make money now enough to support needs and barely scrape by for my Daughters tuition. 

Now on the other hand, my friend and his wife is living on cruise ships. He makes a lot of money so much that he basically lives on cruises and owns a nice condo in Honolulu. They wanted to visit my daughter and during dinner (fancy restaurant payed by them) offered to pay 20% of my daughters tuition. My daughter said why not more and they told her that she wasn't their responsibility as they gave her to me and my wife. Dinner was very awkward after that and outside I called my friend an AH for not paying my daughters tuition. I said he makes very good money and he can afford to pay the tuition. He told me off and left and went back to his fancy condo might I add. While my daughter was in her room crying claiming she hates her father. So much that she blocked all contact with her biological parents and claimed she hates them and never wants to speak to them again.

Last fall we moved into a new house and less than two weeks later, had a baby. We were pretty focused on the whole parenting thing and failed to notice how often the neighbor on one side was using our property for several things without any kind of permission or discussion.

It started with his kids spending their days in our driveway drawing with sidewalk chalk. We had to ask them to stop because we seriously feared running them over when backing out of the garage as they have absolutely no supervision or regard for cars. They stopped drawing and started using our garage door as a bumper stop while riding their scooters and bikes. They physically bashed into the garage door and dented it. I asked them to stop. After a dozen or so instances, they finally stopped.

In the spring, we noticed that the dad was parking his trailer on our side of the property between our two driveways. The property line is very clear with fences and different types of landscaping. In addition, he was pulling his garbage cans through our gravel and making huge tracks.

As we're in the middle of a pandemic and we have a baby, we decided to write a note and leave it with our information while also lining the property line with large rocks. Never heard from them but they had moved the rocks into a pile and the front of our side of the property. We moved the rocks back again and thought we had made our position very clear.

At the beginning of June the dad/husband came and rang our door. He proceeded to tell us that because he's parked his trailer like that since he moved in and no one has cared before so we can't care either. At no point did he ask if he could park on our side or use our property, he said ""It's never been a problem and I should be able to do it."" We politely said we did not give him permission to do so and explained that we intended to landscape the area and his trailer and use of our property would ruin the landscaping we had planned.

The entire conversation was difficult because he spoke over me the entire time and talked to me like a child. At the end of the confrontation, he said we were ""rude neighbors"" and stormed off. Since then, he parks further over, moves our landscaping rocks constantly, and aggressively moves his garbage cans through the gravel leaving marks like he was zig zagging back and forth.

This weekend I started taking photos as proof of his parking and the way he's ruining our gravel with his garbage cans. He came out and glared at me. I, very nicely, again, asked him to stop. He replied ""Why?"" and when I said because it's my property and we've asked him not to he replied ""Whatever."" and walked away.

Now we come to today. I'm done. I am so frustrated that this guy feels like he is entitled to unquestioned use of property that is not his.

TLDR Neighbor with free range children uses, parks, and ruins my property without permission and will not stop even when asked. WIBTA for sending a cease and desist?

 

[**UPDATE**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/jwnzxz/update_wibta_for_sending_neighbor_a_cease_and/) \- 19th November 2020

It's a very happy update!

I drafted the letter with some legal assistance. Prior to sending it, I wanted to ensure I had proper cameras in the event he decided to make things worse. When I installed the camera, the neighbor must have realized why it was installed because they stopped doing all the annoying stuff.

Then, about a month later, they listed their house for sale. They've moved out and we don't have to deal with their entitled asshole attitude anymore!

I appreciate all the assistance and support as I was really unsure if I was going in the right direction.

Edit: I want to clarify. I do not believe that the neighbor moved because of anything I did or asked him to stop doing. I think he had been planning to move for some time and was just an absolute dick of a person. They didn't move because of me, and even if they did, they sold the house for $200,000 more than they bought it 3 years ago. So he is not some victim.

I do appreciate all the kind words. I am also bummed that so many people have shitty neighbors as well.

 

[New Update in the comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/yk64c6/comment/iuxquxz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) \- 4th November 2022 

So I'm OOP and I wanted to let you know that they definitely got their karma. According to the new owner of the house, the AHs went on a vacation to a smallish coastal town in the northwest and for the few days they were in this town the weather was beautiful. So they decided to move there. They overpaid for a house (according to the new owner she said they over bid by $300,000 just to get the house, which was significantly smaller than the house next to me) and made a comment about how nice it will be live on the coast and go to the beach all the time. However, the area they moved is rainy 99% of the time and pretty 1% of the time. It would be like visiting Seattle on a nice day and expecting it to be sunny all the time.

I really hold onto the fact that they moved to a miserable location and smaller house they wildly overpaid for.

So my eight month old baby goes to daycare four days a week. Before all the anti daycare parents come, this is my only form of childcare. Anyways I love the center its very clean and well taken care of. Theres an app where you get hourly updates which have never gone missed and you can request to see cameras whenever you want. The center is very highly rated and has a long waiting list. 


I like the girls that work there, but theres one particular girl that I just dont really like. I didnt care about her until one day when I was speaking to the director, I could see her holding my daughter and kissing all over her face. Yes my daughter was smiling and looked happy but I was disgusted. Theres a pandemic and I just felt it was too far. I brought it up to the director and she turned around shocked and said she would talk to the worker. I didnt think it would be much of an issue moving forward.

But since I saw that I noticed she seems obsessed with my baby. Shes always holding her and cuddling her. I went back and looked through all the pictures they send and realized shes literally in almost every single one. Mind you theres five teachers in the room and lots of babies. I was picking up my daughter a few weeks ago and she wasnt there. I was speaking to another worker in the room and asked her whos my daughters favorite. She told me it was the girl and that my baby is her favorite and her baby and no one else can hold her except for the girl. It was an older women saying this with a smile but I was just more creeped out. 


What sent me over the edge was when I was picking up my daughter last week who was asleep on the workers lap when I walked in and as she handed her to me, she kissed my daughter on the forehead and said she was gonna miss her so much. She literally looked sad. Mind you theres like a dozen other babies in the room too. I went out to the director and told her my concerns and that I felt uncomfortable with the worker with my daughter. I didnt understand the specific fixiation. I recommended she get switched to another room because I didnt want her around my daughter. 


To my surprise when I was dropping off my daughter this morning the director called me into her office and let me know she ended up letting go the girl. I felt justified until I told the story to my SIL, my brothers wife. She actually got upset and said she worked in a daycare throughout college and its normal to have a favorite baby and that she herself had a baby she loved in her center. She said I'm an asshole and that I overreacted and I shouldnt have complained about something so dumb to a director since if they dont fire her itll look bad on the company based on the type of report I made. And that I should be grateful someone really loves my daughter. Am I really the asshole?","AmItheAsshole",4417,4417,0,0.97,3,0,0,839

We got married as soon as we had stable jobs and had a son, Charlie (not his real name). My son and I bonded well, but he and my wife had something different. It wasn't that she coddled him. She was a great mom, strict and firm when she needed to be, loving and caring at all times else. They just *clicked* on a really basic level.

When we were 33, my wife passed in a tragic accident. Charlie was 8 at the time and devastated. I was dysfunctional with grief, but swallowed it pretty quickly. I felt like I owed it to my wife to raise Charlie to be the man he would have been had we raised him together.

For the next 10 years or so, my life was just work and Charlie. My field of work has ungodly hours, but it pays very well and comes with the benefit that work schedules are flexible as long as everything is done on time. Wake up at 5am, go to the gym, feed/dress Charlie, send him to school, arrange for someone to pick him up and baby sit until I got home early evening, make dinner, help him with assignments/drive him to extracurricular activities, work, put Charlie to bed, work, go to bed. Rinse and repeat. That's been my life for a while. A little bit more flexible as Charlie became a teenager, but generally similar.

Busy and monotonous, but it got my mind off the grief and Charlie was doing well. He got into a really good college (like random indigenous people in the middle of the Pacific might have heard of this college levels of good) and the school started in-person classes again for the 2021-2022 school year, so he went off to college last fall.

When he left I felt two things: 1) I was lonely, 2) I wasn't wracked with grief anymore. I'll mourn my previous wife for the rest of my life, but I felt like I could cherish our memories together instead of wallowing in sadness because of them. My friends, family, in-laws all encouraged me to date again, so I downloaded an app and met Carla (again not her real name). She's one of the most charismatic people I've ever met and intelligent, funny, beautiful. Carla moved in earlier this year and I was excited to introduce her to Charlie when he came back home for the summer.

When he came home this May, he wasn't enthused. Holed up in his room unless he went out to meet his neighborhood friends. I'm pretty certain that it's not because of college because we talked regularly and he seemed to be having a great time. Got respectable grades, lots of fun drinking, etc.

Carla and I decided to get married around when Charlie came back home, but I pushed off mentioning it to him; it didn't seem like the best time to bring it up. Maybe I should've waited longer, but he's moving back to school a bit earlier to shadow a doctor. We went out to dinner, and I told him the news.

It didn't go well. He accused me of being predatory because of the difference in age. Carla is 32, but I didn't think the age gap was excessive given our respective ages. He said I was disrespecting my previous wife, and that he wasn't willing to keep in touch if we got married. Carla was quiet the entire time, and I could tell from her expression how hurt she was.

I told my son that I never expected him to see Carla as a parental figure or even as a friend. It would be fine if he saw her as an acquaintance, but she would be family now and that was a decision that I was fully entitled to make for myself.

He's staying at his grandparent's house until he leaves. They're telling me that he thinks I ""chose"" her. Maybe time will give him more perspective.  


EDIT/Additional Details: 

Appreciate that people have taken the time to read through this. Putting things down on paper has always helped me decompress. Here are some additional details/answers to common questions or concerns that people have had

""Aren't you and your fiancee moving far too quickly?""

\-I genuinely appreciate the concern, but I'm a 43 year old adult whose made a living for the past 20 years. I mean this in the most polite way possible - I think I'm the best judge of how quickly/slowly I want things to progress inside a relationship. 

""Why didn't you tell your son about this earlier? What happened during winter break?""

I did, just perhaps not as unequivocally as I should have. I mentioned that I'd downloaded an app and he was amused as that was what many of he and his friends were doing. I brought up sometime later last year that I was more ""serious"" with one of the women I'd been seeing. Perhaps from his perspective, he saw my dating and being serious as more akin to the romantic relationships that he was seeing his peers enter into. A lot of our conversations revolved around him and his college life, and that's on me I guess. 

He went on a trip abroad with his friends  over the winter, and I thought that was fine as traveling has been limited over the past few years because of the pandemic. ","TrueOffMyChest",4311,4311,0,0.95,0,0,0,896

A pro player makes all the right moves only to lose to the river card. An amateur makes a dumb move that winds up netting him/her millions. Most pros accept this as a feature of the game, as the element of randomness leads to some bad luck once in a while. But last year featured a hand so strange, so outside the norm that it drew legitimate suspicion of foul play. And nobody could have predicted the wild rabbit-hole this scandal would take us down&

The scene? **Hustler Casino**, a popular poker hotspot in Southern California known for its high-stakes play. The casino also hosts its own [live streams on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/HustlerCasinoLive/videos), with tens of thousands of live viewers tuning in nightly to see players at the big money tables. Most of the players that appear on these streams are amateurs with deep pockets, but they also manage to draw some big pro names like Phil Ivey, Doug Polk, and Tom Dwan for their games. The casino therefore has a strong reputation among the pros and maintains relationships with these players to ensure they keep coming back.

On September 29, Hustler Casino Live hosted a cash game featuring a pro regular, **Garrett Adelstein**, widely known as one of the best cash players in the world  and [one of the worst Survivor players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsBWu1CtO7o), but thats neither here nor there. He was doing fairly well against the table full of amateurs, including **Robbi Jade Lew**, an LA local with no prior high-level cash winnings who only started playing poker seriously during the pandemic. There was another amateur player by the name of **Jacob Rip Chavez** playing at the table, a former boxing trainer for Jake Paul, who will also become significant later.

**The hand**

[Here is the now-infamous hand if you want to watch it in its entirety](https://twitter.com/PokerNews/status/1575669707721478145). Garrett is dealt 8-7 of clubs, a solid hand with a lot of flop potential, while Robbi has J-4 offsuit, a pretty garbage hand that you should usually fold. But Robbi has good position on Garrett and clearly wants to try something tricky, so she calls his raise and the two of them go to the flop.

The flop comes 10h10c9c, giving Garrett a straight flush draw, meaning hes one card away from the best possible hand in poker but currently has nothing. He makes a small bet, and Robbi calls  strange, but so far not super suspicious.

The turn card is a 3h, a blank for both players. Garrett again bets small, Robbi makes a small raise to try and scare him away, and Garrett decides to go all-in for roughly $150,000 (a common play for strong draws like his to scare away all but the best of holdings). At this point Robbi still has nothing and has no choice but to fold. But inexplicably to everyone (including the commentators), she goes deep into the tank, thinking for several minutes and even wasting a time chip to keep thinking, before she calls!

The river turns up no help for Garrett, and he knows hes beat. They turn over their hands, and Garrett is absolutely shocked at her call. The table is amazed at her successful hero call and compliments Robbi on her big win, and she engages Garrett in some light trash talk, but Garrett looks like he thinks something is very suspicious about her call and betting patterns.

A quick aside on **ranges** (technical poker speak here). In a situation like Robbis where you are considering a hero call, you have to assign a range of possible hands that Garrett could be representing with an all-in. By making the call, Robbi clearly had him on either a bluff or a draw. But strangely, several bluffs or draws STILL would have beaten her, including Ax, Kx, Qx, J8, or any pair. (You can even hear her say I thought you had Ace high at 5:27, which is a hand that would have beaten her.) Garrett happened to have the one exact hand combination she could beat within that range, and EVEN THEN she was barely 50-50 to win on the river as Garrett could still win with any club, Jack, 8, 7, or 6. Whether you think she was cheating or not, make no mistake: it was an objectively terrible call on all metrics.

**Immediate aftermath and reactions**

Garrett stepped away from the table after this hand and spoke to one of the stream managers off-camera. A few minutes later, Robbi was called away from the table to talk with both Garrett and this manager about the hand. [As Garrett recounted in a statement after the fact](https://twitter.com/GmanPoker/status/1575727289932709888), he questioned her directly about her play logic and shared his suspicions that she had somehow unfairly won the hand via third-party communication with somebody who knew the hole cards. [Part 2 here.](https://twitter.com/GmanPoker/status/1575727417284382721) Robbi eventually offered to pay Garrett back the money she had won from him in the hand, and he accepted, interpreting this as an admission of guilt from her and an attempt to make the situation go away.

Hours later, [Robbi fired back at Garrett](https://twitter.com/RobbiJadeLew/status/1575714975875665920), saying that she won the hand fair and square by reading him correctly. She also [gave a slightly different version of events](https://twitter.com/RobbiJadeLew/status/1575758837465812992) during their off-camera discussion, claiming that Garrett cornered and threatened her until she offered to pay him back. [Robbi also appeared on Joe Ingrams live stream later that night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqyGFgvJJZo) (at roughly the 6hr31m mark) to further defend herself, saying that she paid Garrett back not as an admission of guilt but as a peace offering to get him back to the table.

Interestingly, after Robbi gave Garrett his money back, the player known as Rip got up from the table and [yelled at Garrett for pressuring her into it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xhjtl9lifx0). Several other players also expressed disgust at Garretts behavior, but Rip in particular seemed to have a personal stake in the matter, and he could later be seen on stream talking privately with Robbi, indicating that the two had more than a passing relationship with one another. And indeed, earlier in the live stream, Robbi had mentioned that she and Rip were business partners. Had Rip staked her in this game, and was he upset that her paying Garrett meant that his cut of her profits would be lower?

Word of this incredible hand spread like wildfire through the poker community in the coming days, and the clip of Robbi beating Garrett went viral online. Poker pros were initially split on the scandal. Several pros like [Daniel Negreanu](https://twitter.com/RealKidPoker/status/1575723339338743808), [Ronnie Bardah](https://twitter.com/RonnieBardah/status/1575678820660699136), [Melanie Weisner](https://twitter.com/melanieweisner/status/1577195805093416961), [Faraz Jaka](https://twitter.com/FarazJaka/status/1576141823357390849), [Allen Kessler](https://twitter.com/whoisalexjacob/status/1582207833176969216) and [Liv Boeree](https://twitter.com/Liv_Boeree/status/1575724290405675008) came to Robbis defense, arguing that she may have just been caught up in the moment and made a bad play that happened to work out. Negreanu also argued that her paying Garrett off afterwards is not necessarily an admission of guilt, but perhaps just a way of [avoiding conflict and settling the matter without further drama](https://twitter.com/RealKidPoker/status/1575726681117011968). Others like [Shaun Deeb](https://twitter.com/shaundeeb/status/1576008843212906496), [Eric Froehlich](https://twitter.com/efropoker/status/1578179873730072576), [Tom Dwan](https://twitter.com/TomDwan/status/1577536395542863872) and [Doug Polk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPQUarLEr9A) seemed fairly confident that something was fishy and sided with Garrett.

**Hustler investigates**

It should be noted that there was [another infamous case in 2019](https://www.wired.com/story/stones-poker-cheating-scandal/) of a casino employee colluding with a player to cheat on live streamed games, and in that instance the casinos response was to shut down the stream forever and go radio silent on the matter, providing zero closure for the fans and player base. However, Hustler Casino wanted to handle things differently, as the co-founders of the live stream believed in the integrity of the product and wanted to uncover the full truth. They began to review the footage and hired a third-party firm to conduct an internal investigation of the incident.

On October 6, Hustler [released a statement](https://twitter.com/HCLPokerShow/status/1578169889788862464) updating fans on the investigation, and they revealed a shocking discovery made during their review of the tapes. At one point during the game, while Robbi was away from the table, a Hustler employee by the name of **Bryan Sagbigsal** walked up and stole $15,000 worth chips from her stack without anyone noticing. The casino fired Bryan and brought the matter to the attention of the local Gardena Police Department, who approached Robbi and asked her if she wanted to file charges against Bryan, but she declined.

In the hours and days following this revelation, online sleuths were quick to draw connections between Bryan and the allegedly cheated hand. For one thing, [Bryan had tweeted in support of the production crew](https://twitter.com/zbeg/status/1578191037109239808) shortly after the hand went viral (later deleting his entire account after his theft was made public). Robbi put out a statement [denying knowledge of who Bryan was when the police contacted her](https://twitter.com/ChadAHolloway/status/1578193147338772480), but it was later uncovered that [Robbi and Bryan followed each other on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realcharder30/status/1578199504758505472), seemingly contradicting that statement.

Doug Polk was permitted backstage access to Hustler during the investigation, and he discovered that [Bryans desk was located directly in front of the hole card displays during live streams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3l7xw7mbcs) and that a file cabinet had recently been moved right next to the desk, as though to shield himself from view of the other employees. A couple days later during a separate live stream, Bryan was also caught on camera approaching the table and handing something to a different player; it was later revealed to be poker chips totaling $10,000 that he owed the player. Wonder where he got the money to pay him back? And how many different players did Bryan have financial ties to, exactly??

On October 7, [Garrett posted a lengthy report on the TwoPlusTwo poker forums](https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/29/news-views-gossip/garrett-adelstein-report-likely-cheating-hustler-casino-live-1813491/#post57848911), outlining every bit of potential evidence he had that there was foul play involved. He concluded that Robbi was likely part of a (minimum) three-person cheating operation involving Rip, Bryan the employee, and potentially another player at the table by the name of Nik Airball, based on their suspicious on-camera behavior and previously-undisclosed financial ties to one another. 

Robbi [released her own statement](https://twitter.com/RobbiJadeLew/status/1578659450545545216) hours later, saying that Garretts report was full of inaccuracies and conjecture and continuing to maintain her innocence. She also [submitted herself to a lie detector test](https://twitter.com/RobbiJadeLew/status/1580778995271946240/photo/3) in an effort to further prove her innocence. Nik Airball [preempted the report with a statement of his own](https://twitter.com/nikairball/status/1578465809315209216) and explained why he loaned Rip $175k to play in the now-infamous cash game. On October 9, a user claiming to be Bryan Sagbigsal [made a post on Two Plus Two poker forums](https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showpost.php?p=57852199&amp;postcount=877) refuting Garretts cheating claims and affirming his own innocence in the scandal.

**Things get really, really weird**

At this point in the investigation, the poker community was HEAVILY invested in the outcome and wild speculation abounded. Many felt that a player of Garretts caliber would never risk his reputation with such accusations without good cause. Crazy theories were thrown about regarding possible cheating methods, including [vibrating jewelry](https://meaww.com/poker-fan-spotted-moment-after-robbi-jade-lew-allegedly-used-vibrating-ring-for-winning-cards) (sound familiar, chess fans?), [the dealer giving odd hand signals](https://twitter.com/Kaylynn1011/status/1578220896145534976) and [Jake Paul fight tickets being used as bribery for collusion](https://twitter.com/JacobRIPChavez/status/1578896611367079936). Poker pros were [making parlay bets with one another on who was involved](https://twitter.com/DGAFPokerPlayer/status/1578915103046393856) and [a bounty for information was created](https://twitter.com/Joeingram1/status/1578215182618095616), which eventually grew to over $200,000 for anyone who came clean about their role in the supposed cheating ring.

[The LA Times wrote an article](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-10-07/poker-cheating-scandal-robbi-jade-lew) telling Robbis story, which only intensified the scrutiny on her. The same Times reporter later [tracked down Sagbigsal to his girlfriends familys house](https://twitter.com/byandreachang/status/1579532511923023874) and he refused to give a statement (despite supposedly posting on the 2+2 forums the day before).

Robbis own behavior following the Hustler report was also scrutinized. Some questioned the legitimacy of the lie detector test, which was conducted by [a shady bail bond business](https://twitter.com/scgolfhack/status/1580925871841759232). The LA Times also disputed [her prior claim](https://twitter.com/RobbiJadeLew/status/1585768955406209025) that she had [submitted her phone records to them](https://twitter.com/GmanPoker/status/1585699901060415488) when they never received any such thing. Many questioned why she had initially failed to file charges against Sagbigsal but later changed her mind when confronted about it. There was even speculation that [Robbi had faked DMs that Bryan allegedly sent her](https://twitter.com/AllenKessler/status/1579030432812699649) to try and distance herself further from him and explain her apathy to her stolen chips.

**Hustlers conclusion**

The memes and wild conspiracy theories were truly out of control by this point. The eclectic cast of characters and downright absurd allegations felt akin to [a Netflix melodrama](https://twitter.com/SrslySirius/status/1579252969085640704), and it seemed impossible that things would resolve without some explosive revelations coming to light. But unfortunately, nothing ever did, and slowly but surely, interest in the investigation waned as it became clear no cheating ring was about to be uncovered.

Weeks later, on December 14, Hustler Casino completed their investigation and [published their findings](https://twitter.com/HCLPokerShow/status/1603094945987895296). They concluded that, while cheating was theoretically possible in the hand, no evidence of wrongdoing had been found, either by production staff or the private investigation firm hired for the task. The report refuted several of the more outlandish cheating theories, from the vibrating jewelry to the hacked RFID card reader system. HCL also announced increased security measures for future live streams, including limited access to hole cards among production staff and requiring signed statements from all players that they are not financially affiliated with anyone else at the table.

[Garrett responded to the report](https://twitter.com/GmanPoker/status/1603141694248996865) by praising the security changes but making no comment on the findings themselves. He has yet to return to a live stream since the incident (his wife just had a baby, to be fair), but said that he has found peace away from poker and is open to returning to Hustler or another stream in the near future. Robbi [released her own statement to the LA Times](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-12-14/poker-cheating-investigation-ends), saying the results were as she expected and implying that further legal action would be taken on the matter in the future (which has yet to materialize).

So the controversy ended with a whimper rather than a bang. The poker community remains divided on the subject, but for now the Robbi naysayers have been quieted by the lack of evidence. Many still believe Garrett should have to apologize and/or return Robbis money before he is accepted back into the community, though that seems increasingly unlikely to happen by the day.

Meanwhile, the J4 hand has become the stuff of legend, and players frequently [tweet at Robbi sharing their own success stories with the dubious hand](https://twitter.com/RobbiJadeLew/status/1590180147587842048). Robbis popularity has grown significantly throughout the incident, especially after the Hustler investigation cleared her and the massive bounty went unclaimed. We may never know if there was foul play in the infamous hand or not, but it remains one of the biggest scandals in the poker world in over a decade.","HobbyDrama",3907,3907,0,0.98,1,1,0,457

The title sounds insane but here I go.

Weve been married for 6 years and have 2 kids Im pregnant with a third.

My husband works from 9-5, comes home, does his chores, plays with our 2 kids, talks to me for a little bit, and then goes to sleep. But he doesnt seem to enjoy doing any of it. Like this whole thing is one big chore.

He used to be this goofy guy who smiled and told jokes all the time, but I havent seen the man smile in months.

Its not like hes neglecting his duties as a husband and father, but he acts like its just that, duties. Like hanging with the kids and me is a second job.

Im grateful for all hes doing, and he makes all of our lives sooo much easier, but its like hes constantly on the clock and I think he might be depressed.

I tried asking him if he was doing ok and he tells me hes doing fantastic, but I know hes not. Thats the line he uses at work when customers try to make small talk and ask how hes doing.

He doesnt take anytime for himself. He doesnt take any breaks, he stopped playing games and stopped watching tv. He just does what I feel he thinks needs to be done and I dont know how to help him out.

Our sex life has become one sided. We do it frequently but only because I initiate frequently. Even if he doesnt seem in the mood hell do it. Like its his responsibility to make me happy. It feels like he isnt there in the moment, like his mind is wandering the whole time were intimate and that, to me, feels worse than getting rejected.

I dont know whats going on, and I dont know how to help because he wont let me in. To anybody else he seems fine, but I know something is wrong and I dont know how to fix this.

I miss my husband, the guy who complained, and told jokes. Not this robotic shell that looks like him.

Edit: Alright, wow! I didnt expect this to blow up. I want to thank you all for your advice; I really appreciate it. Its clear to me now that my husband is overworked and burnt out.

He comes home from work in a couple hours and Im going to sit him down and talk to him. Im going to tell him how I feel, and I hope that together we can find a solution that turns him back into the man he once was.

Im sorry if wasnt able to respond to everyone, but I want you all to know I read every comment and response.

Ill post an update soon about how it goes.

Byee!!

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hmzvgt/update_my_32f_husband_36m_became_a_robot_and_i/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Hey everybody, heres the update. I wrote this a couple days ago but couldnt post it because it was too soon.

My husband came home at around 6 oclock, and after he had something to eat I took him to the bedroom to talk.

I sat him down on the bed and told him I was worried about him. I didnt know exactly how to phrase my worries so I just showed him my original post.

When he finished reading the post he starting crying, like full on crying. In all the years that I have known this man, I had never seen a tear roll down his eye. I held him for a few minutes until he could recompose himself, and he told me everything.

He told me that the world was in a shitty place right now, and that were bringing a child into a stressful time.

He said when I became pregnant he felt he had to step up. He needed to take care of things because it was his responsibility.

He said that the weight of carrying the family was so much harder than he anticipated so he thought if he doubled down he could get through it. But the more he tried the darker the tunnel got and eventually he couldnt see an end.

He said that he feels like hes constantly drowning, and the only breath of fresh air is on the car ride between home and work.

He said that sometimes the stress is so much that he throws up, but doesnt tell anyone and instead keeps going with his day. He then pulled out a pack of gum from his pocket and said this was for when it happens.

I asked him why he couldnt tell me any of this, and he said he didnt want to burden me with the truth.

He said that, he thought if he told me everything, that I would stop seeing him as a protecter and provider, and that I would inevitably stop loving him.

Hearing him say that brought tears to my eyes because I didnt know where he got the notion I would feel that way.

I asked him if he wanted to quit his job but surprisingly he said the job doesnt bother him. He said the work in of it self was fine. Its just now he feels an added weight to provide because not only was he fortunate enough to keep his job in the pandemic, but we also had a kid on the way.

He said that some days he feels like packing a suit case and running to some tropical island for a week and not telling anyone. But then he feels guilty and doubles down even more.

I told him that maybe he should go on a trip. I said that he deserved a break, and maybe if he did exactly that hed feel better. He tried to protest, but I insisted. In the end said that hell only go, if we go together. Like a romantic get away between spouses.

Once things start to clear up and before the baby is due, he wants to take a week off from work, drop the kids off at Grandmas house and have us go on a vacation. Just the two of us, like we used to when we first got married.

He also said he wants to take the day off tomorrow and just sleep in, so thats the plan. Ill call his boss tomorrow and say that hes sick and cant come in, its not like theyll make a sick man come in to work. Theres a pandemic going on :).

Right now hes playing with the kids and it doesnt feel like hes doing one of his chores. He actually seems to be enjoying himself.

For the first time in months I dont see the robot, I see my husband.

Edit: Hey everyone, I want to thank you all for the support. I read all of your comments, and I appreciate all of you.

I didnt expect this to get so much traction, so I want to clarify some things.

First things first, my husband says hi.

I wanted to clarify about the chores people are taking about. I want to say that I know as a SAHM the bulk of chores goes to me. I cook and clean and do laundry because I know its my responsibility. My husbands only chores are doing dishes, vacuuming every three days, and a few other house maintenance stuff.

I did in fact call in sick for my husband, but I made sure that I said he had a migraine. I saw on google that it wasnt a symptom of COVID if it was an isolated symptom. His boss was okay with it and said he can come back whenever he feels better.

The pregnancy wasnt an accident. We both did want to have 3 kids because we were both raised in 3 kid families. We actively tried for the first 2, but for baby number 3 it was kind of a if it happens it happens kind of thing. Were both happy with the amount of kids we have/ will have and are hopefully done. We are not considering abortion nor adoption.

We realize that a one week vacation isnt enough to get rid of his stress and are both trying to come up with a solution that alleviates his stress in a more sustainable way. Right now were thinking about setting up an hour or 2 a day thats, daddys time. No kids, no me, no work. Just for him to relax.

To those of you who think this fake; there isnt any way I can change your minds about this situation so Im not really too bothered. I just hope you this never happens to you guys.

You all have been supportive and really a wonderful bunch of people. I really think we can get through this, and it wouldnt have been possible without you guys.

Im not going to reply to comments because, like last time, its an overwhelming amount. But just know Im reading these as they come in.

[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/sn30ar/parents_expect_me17f_to_stay_past_turning_18_to/)

I've been sitting on this for a very long time, and have waited until I was at a semi-safe/moderately safe place to say anything. I'm (hopefully) moving out on the 28th and feel like I can post this and whether they see it or not there's not they can truly do at this point. It's kind of long, but this is a long story that took place over several years so I feel like I've condensed it with enough detail to make somewhat sense.

I've been watching my three younger siblings since I was 14 and we had just moved to a different state, and at that point the youngest kid was 2 1/2, now 6. Up until then I'd never had a very good relationship with any of them, barely hung out with them(stayed mostly at/with my grandmother, didn't even have a good relationship with my parents), and was resentful of them because of my parent's (mom and stepdad) very obvious favoritism of them.

It started small, just an hour or two, and them quickly devolved into watching them for hours on end into the night when they made friends with neighbors and went out, to watching them nearly full-time and when the parents were home just before the pandemic hit. I watched them with NO pay (unless you count them feeding/housing/not giving me to an abuser as payment like they did) until them, and they started with 25$ a week, no exceptions and it didn't matter how much I actually worked and I NEVER actually touched any cash. They would buy things for me IF they had money on the side from their own spending.

The pandemic made it very, VERY easy to guilt trip me into watching them all the time and sacrificing EVERYTHING. There are several different stories I could tell but some of the quick points are: I let them pull me from school to do all virtual despite having some apprehension (they pressed this solely so I could watch/pick up the kids after they went to school), I let them pay me and then hold this pay over my head (I'd be nothing without them, they'll just not even offer the gracious money they're offering and make me do it anything, they'll kick me out/stop feeding me, etc), I let them continue to pull me out of school for my SENIOR YEAR (another long story, and I'd always said through the pandemic I wanted to do my senior year in person), I let them ruin my relationship with my girlfriend for a long while before I put my foot down and repaired it (going steady since sophomore year, as serious as a high school level relationship can get), and I let them take my opportunity to get a job/license and work for them with 45-60 hour work weeks babysitting.

These kids are not angels, hell not even part angel. They go unchecked and undisciplined. I am the ONLY one they even semi listen to, and that's a 50/50 chance. They run around like banshees, hit and scream and are just generally bad kids. They're constantly on a screen and have been as long as I remember, watching ""scary"" videos and murderer-y videos and things that generally young children shouldn't be watching. They stay up as late as I do (I've had trouble sleeping literally since I was a baby, and I'm trying to help myself without becoming dependent on melatonin and such so I don't become immune) and sometimes even later. For reference, that can mean 4-5-6 AM and I someties get knocks at my door asking for food and such. It's not just me who says these things, My grandmother who watches them when we go back to our hometown, my family who sees them, my girlfriend's family who's seen them act this way, their teachers, etc also say this or say it more politely.

The youngest is the worst, going the most unchecked and ignored and when she's bad it's ""well she has ADHD so."" NO. It's not an excuse, not even a DIAGNOSIS. YOU just don't parent her, and don't want to help her, mom. I have ADD(diagnosed, unmedicated because my mom refused to remedicate me after the last pills made it difficult to maintain weight and gave me facial tics). I understand that sometimes it's not fun or easy for people to be around me but even I can say I don't think she has ADHD or even if she does have it, I think she has a mom who doesn't discipline her and instead encourages bad behaviours. It's ridiculous. The middle kid is becoming more mature at 9 but still unchecked and doesn't listen. The oldest who is now 12 is realizing his parents don't actually parent and is becoming resentful as the younger girls get favored because he's getting prepped to be the next me.

I understand the whole older kids babysitting younger kids thing, but you CAN NOT expect a 14 year old who barely recognized her sibling's voices to be able to cope well with that kind of child care job. Hell, I don't even really like children, and even as a kid I didn't really hang out with younger kids than me because I found them annoying (ironic, I know, because I was probably just as annoying). Making me do this made me resent them even more in all honesty. It was exhausting, and made me a resentful person for a while, and I still am very angry and have a lot of pent up frustration that I'm trying to work through. I don't think I've ever been capable of caring properly for these kids in my honest opinion, and they should have either a real babysitter or afterschool care. I've had several breakdowns and just am not mentally well enough for this job and my concerns and valid points for this have been ignored.

When we moved towns (23 minute drive between my house and my gf's house for reference) they got very, very bold. My biological dad is dead, and because of that my mother recieves a survivor's check with stipulations as to where it can be spent. My ENTIRE family bashes her for refusing to use that money correctly and abusing it, and it's an extremely sore and sensitive spot between us, especially with all of the ""jokes"" that they use my check for themselves and that the moeny isn't really for me but them and how they quite literally refused to let me stay in my hometown where I was happier/healthier because that meant they'd lose the check. They've openly admitted they were NEVER going to let me know of it's existence because they didn't want me to know.

I found out the only reason they can afford the house we're in is because of the check. They depend on this despite having a second job and well paying government jobs. You might say well the pandemic but NO. They've admitted if they just cut back on frivolous things like that $1,000 armchair they bought in december and my mom's purses, and all of their other BULLSHIT they'd be able to do it on their own. They guilt trip me by saying that if I don't stay they'll lose the house and it'll be all my fault.

Eventually it all came to a head back in October. I'd put my foot down and demanded I get a job, I needed money for college and had NOTHING to show for my life and had NO way to pay for college, not even a license to get there at that point. This ended in a huge blow out fight where I did some things I regret (I called names, kicked a recycling can over, punched a wall, got in my parent's faces when they did mine, essentially stooped to their level and I'm ashamed to admit it but I will own up to my mistakes) and she trashed my room and told me she'd never let me leave and that as long as I was HER kid I had no say in anything and my life was hers to control essentially. She went on a rampage saying how she'd take every contact to everyone I knew away and how she'd make everyone hate me and how she'd make it so I couldn't physically leave because I was all alone and had no one.

I am EXTREMELY afraid of this. I'm afraid of people leaving me, I'm afraid of people not coming back and she knew this as she said it all. I snapped out of it at that point, realized I had a scared dog upstairs who'd be coming back to my bedroom with glass everywhere because my mom threw a box of 20 or so glass bottles on the floor(collected for recycling), realized I had a girlfriend I loved who I wanted in my life, school to attend that I couldn't if she were to take my laptop, and that I would still have to watch her kids to fucking eat and actually survive here.

I immiediately backpedaled and apologized, and went along with what she was saying. I was promised therapy, pills, help with the kids, whatever bullshit she spilled out and I knew everything was a lie. I refused to watch them until we had an agreement and then I was paid $32 a week flat(I'd be leaving friday-sunday for a real job in my old town with my gf, so I ""lost"" friday's money. whatever, I'd be making way more at the new job) supposed to be in cash but that stopped about a month afterward where it was put on a cashapp card but only with whatever they could spare depending on my wants and their extra money that they didn't spend.

Since then, I've been threatened to be held at my house so I'd be fired with my phone turned off because my job's policy is if you don't show up to a scheduled shift without any kind of notice (with an exception to emergencies, of course) then you're fired. They run a formal restuaraunt that's successful and can't risk liabilities like people who don't show up, which I understand. I've been avoiding a bank account because I don't want her to have access to my money (cash my money with my gf and hold it at her house, not mine). I'm looking for a car and am getting ready to make a DMV appointment the week of my birthday (hopefully!), along with a bank/savings account and walker's license.

They've been getting more and more aggressive with saying I'm not leaving, to the point it's mentioned at least once a day. At first it was you aren't leaving until you graduate so we have someone to watch the kids, then it was that they needed my check to pay their mortagage and wouldn't get it unless I stayed, and now it's that I'll stay until the end of or beginning of (depending on mood ig?) summer to ""help them in their time of need."" They've threatened to put me in a psychward, to have me arrested, to give my family members up for things THEY have asked them to do to guilt trip me, and to have my girlfriend's parents arrested for harboring me as a runaway after I'm 18(I don't think they can do that unless I'm in danger, which I'm not and her family can pass a wellness check with flying colors which I agree with. I also can prove I have a paying job, nutritious food to eat, and a safe place to stay.)

I am not a nanny, I've been prevented in furthering my life, and I've been withheld from getting the necessary things to survive on my own. I owe nothing to them or their kids, and in self preservation have to let them be on their own and figure their own shit out. I didn't want kids, I didn't buy a house I couldn't afford and depend on a government check to help me along, I need to go to school to get the kind of job I want.

I'll answer any questions in the comments.

[EDIT] I would like to thank every single person in the comments. I appreciate all the kind words and advice I've recieved, and am taking a lot of it to heart. Shit hit the fan only about 3 or 4 days after I posted this, and the situation is ever evolving and more complicated than I'd like to admit. I will post again by the end of week with a full update and explaination of everything that happened, and until then would like anyone who is concerned to know that both my dog and I are safe for the time being.

--------------------------------------------------------------

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/entitledparents/comments/t59zw1/update_parents_expect_me17f_to_stay_past_turning/)

My dog and I are safely moved out and okay. A lot went down in the past two weeks and my mental health wasn't too great after leaving, so my update is a bit late as I didn't want to just babble nonsense and overwhelm myself further. I do want to state before you read this post that I understand that some of my actions weren't necessarily the best choices and that I know some of my actions were influenced by guilt tripping/manipulation. I'm okay with my current situation/agreement as it's incredibly temporary, and I don't think there would've been a more peaceful resolution.

A few days after posting my original EP story, I revealed to them I was leaving. I did this because they were already starting to poke around and ask questions and I knew they were going to find out either way. I wanted to be a bit in control of the situation and didn't want to risk getting caught off guard. I can say honestly it was the best solution knowing what I know now and what happened after I told them.

I attempted to talk to them calmly with my girlfriend and dog in the car across the street and me as the only one in the house. It was a safeguard in case anything got physically violent because if it did I would walk out and leave and would 100% tell police I didn't feel safe if they continued to pursue me. This backfired a bit as they were very, very upset and said things I just can't forgive them for but I'd already anticipated the freak out. I was told that I would be cutting off all my bridges to them and if I ever had to ask them for help or come back that I'd be doing every house chore they could think of and I'd have to quit my job to watch the kids 24/7 even on weekends, that my relationship with my gf was abusive/unsafe and unhealthy and that I was manipulated by her to move in, that they didn't want me anymore, that I was screwing them over and it didn't matter if I was trying to better my life because it didn't benefit them, etc. I would like to point out they had told me in the fight that they hoped I wouldn't lose my job because I wasn't leaving for the next two weeks, and how that'd look on me applying for new ones. I didn't let on that I already talked to my boss.

I'd anticipated and even heard much of this before so I just kind of sat quietly and reiterated that I wasn't changing my mind on moving out. They still weren't happy but I talked to my girlfriend in the car for a while afterward and eventually sent her home after calming down. My mother had already contacted my grandmother(someone who's opinion means a lot to me) to try and convince me to stay until at least the end of the school year. She had my grandmother bug me until about a day before I left and try to guilt trip me into staying. My mother also used the fact that my grandfather has cancer (""how are you going to get up to PA? You're never gonna see pappy before he dies!"") against me, and other older family members on my dad's side to try and convince me to stay by saying if I don't stay they won't take me up there and it's expensive to go.

I refused to stay and it ended in a few days of quiet tension between all of us before we started talking again. I was then told I could actually leave for work and that ""she said that when she was mad, why would you think that would stand?"" It resulted in me leaving for the weekend (my most important valuables had been moved out, stuff like my dead dad's hat/stuff from my baby box, some trinkets from family, etc). We fought for the remainder of the two weeks, going back and forth on ""compromises"" and what I was going to do and how I was going to care for myself. I will point out the ""big"" fights/talks as they are important.

After coming back from that weekend I sat down with them per their request to talk about potential situations. They said they genuinely couldn't afford the house and child care, showed me that no one was even responding to their ads, and that after school services were all booked in our area. I said fine, then let's talk about it, but I'm a) not giving up any days I could potentially work at my job and b) not agreeing to anything at this point because I need time to think. The potential plan we came up with was I come home on sundays, my stepdad would pick me up, and my girlfriend would pick me up wednesday to take me to work in the same fashion of how we'd do it on fridays. I walked away from that conversation with both of us agreeing that I agreed to NOTHING we talked about. I then got texted later that night (1ish in the morning) asking if potentially 8-9pm was good for a sunday pickup. I tried to avoid the question and ask something else but he was persistant until I finally said ""yeah, that could potentially work if we do that."" Intentionally vague/not agreeing that it was a permanant solution.

My girlfriend refused to drive me back and forth, which I agreed with as it's an hours drive back and forth and as they needed me and because they refused to help me get my own licence when I wanted/needed it they should be the ones to drive me. I came up with a solution of well maybe I could give them wednesdays if I had them off, otherwise the other babysitter they'd manage to find for part time work could do the wednesdays I couldn't. They flipped again, saying I was going back on our agreement and I was lying and a manipulative little shit, and that I wasn't being reasonable and I was again fucking them over. I reiterated I didn't AGREE to anything. I never AGREED to even stay in any capacity, and I was pissed they attempted to gaslight me into believing that I did.

It ended in another argument where very much things were said again but I kind of just ignored it, stuck to my guns, and they relented. I didn't give them wednesdays because I wasn't comfortable with it anymore because I couldn't trust them to get me to my job on wednesday reliably and I didn't really want to be there more than I had to and their other babysitter agreed to take wednesdays.

It ended in an argument over messenger while she was at work where she essentially told me that when I worked next I could pack my stuff and leave. She then texted my girlfriend and her parents a huge list of all my ""problems"" and how I'm just using them and waiting for my chance to fuck them over too. Including discussing my psychiatric hospital visits and past parental abuse (hospital visits mostly BECAUSE of the parental abuse, and I was freshly 13 at my last visit.) They said they dismissed it because they'd a) known me for 3 years at this point and what my mom was saying wasn't lining up with what they saw, and b) they weren't going to take my mom's word when she was acting crazy and revealing things they weren't even sure if I was comfortable discussing outside of a therapist's office. I'm INCREDIBLY grateful for them, and have told them that if I do ever do anything to wrong them I EXPECT punishment, but that I'd never intentionally wrong them. I really do love them like my family and would protect them like they are.

She came home, tried to say that me buying myself and my siblings pizza the other night was ""trying to get brownie points before screwing them over"" and that I was being an ass. I had no ulterior motives with the pizza, I just wanted pizza and felt guilty ordering some and not sharing because the kids had wanted pizza for the past two weeks so I just bought them some too. I was prepared to leave that night and had all my stuff packed, and said as such and she flipped again. It resulted in a fight where she slandered my deceased father (I'm not sure if what she said was true, and I'm not really willing to find out), namecalled, said I would come crawling back, that she'd always love me as her firstborn but hated the person I was, begged for me to stay and help. It ended with both of us walking away unhappy until we talked about it later that night again.

What it's come down to is this: I work Monday/Tuesday. THEY drive me to and from, meaning they pick me up Sunday and drop me back off Tuesday. My stepdad gets a work from home job in April after training through March, and then I no longer have to come over at all and they'll leave me alone. They want nothing to do with my dog at all, even just to spite me. My mom doesn't like him and neither does my stepdad, so they said if I didn't take him they'd dump him. I scheduled my permit test wrong and it got rescheduled for the 16th, but good news is I've studied enough that I'm 100% sure I'll pass, and my girlfriend's mom said to not pay for a walker's license because it's a very short wait and after I get the permit I can get the bank account and such. I'm trying to figure out what's going on with my SS check and am in contact with the office and school and trying to figure out how to change the stuff. My mom wants half of it and she'll be quiet if she gets it, so I'm debating just sacrificing that half for the sake of peace of mind/sanity since I have a steady job and plan on picking up another after April.

I'm sorry if this isn't what people wanted, but I've seen what they do to people to get revenge if you fuck them over. The way she talked to me during that last fight tells me she no longer sees me as her kid in any capacity, just somebody she'll fuck over if I don't at least agree to the bare minimum like I did. But after April I'm no longer useful and I'll get forgotten, like everyone else, which is why I'm even agreeing to it in the first place.

If you have any questions I'll answer them. I understand some of this is a bit rambly/emotional but I'm not sure how else to write it.","BestofRedditorUpdates",3669,3669,0,0.93,0,0,0,297

#[I lost my support system for my new baby. Now I'm going to therapy.](https://redd.it/oey4y9) - /r/QAnonCasualties - July 2021

I had a baby in December 2020, in an area with an incredibly high case count, in a hospital with a line wrapped around the building with sick folks getting tested for Covid. Every person I interacted with during labor and recovery was dressed head-to-toe in PPE. I gave birth wearing PPE. Every few hours the ICU code blue alarm with go off. It was awful. 

Not as awful as our first months with our sweet boy, though, thanks to Q. Most of my family are conservative evangelicals, and every single one of them has adopted QAnon as their new religion. No one will get vaccinated. No one followed Covid safety protocols. A TON of them got sick with Covid over the holidays, and yet they STILL believe Covid is a conspiracy created by China and the Dems. Currently, they're on a mission to equate continued mask mandates and vaccine ""passports"" to the Holocaust, which is ironic, because they don't even believe the Holocaust was real at this point. 

I have been living in a state of disbelief the past year. Most of my family were silent Trump supporters before all of this, but seemed to stick with him more out of allegiance to the Republican party than from having an active interest in politics. Now, they spew Q conspiracies and misinformation daily on social media, and bring it into every conversation I have with them. 

I have had such little support with the baby, and have struggled intensely with postpartum anxiety, most likely due to navigating the trenches of parenthood with a newborn--during a global pandemic--with only my husband by my side. I'm so thankful for him, and so proud of us for our resiliency and love for one another during such a difficult time. We've kept our son safe. We've raised him by ourselves. And he is loved beyond measure by his mom and dad.

I feel robbed of our newborn experience. I'm so angry at everyone who was supposed to be in our support system, who haven't even met our sweet boy because of their insane beliefs. I feel betrayed by my own mother, who was supposed to be by my side as I battled PPA and raising a baby. Instead, she cries every phone call we have, because she can't see our baby (I've even offered to meet outdoors, as long as she wears a mask--which she refuses to do), and because we are probably ""shedding"" dangerous DNA to our baby because we're vaccinated. She's convinced that when we inevitably die because we got ""the jab"", she'll be the one who will take care of our son. My mom, a person I used to trust more than anyone, is currently on a ""red alert"" list at my son's daycare of people who are NOT ALLOWED to pick him up or stay on the daycare premises. I'm legitimately concerned that she is now capable of trying to take him from us.

So I'm in therapy. I probably will be for a while. I've always been a happy, loving person. I'm still her, but I have so much rage and resentment that I don't know what to do with now. How did this happen? How did so many people, who I only used to disagree on politics with, turn into these hateful monsters?

&gt; *Im so so sorry. Family betrayal is so earth shattering.   Definitely do as much talk therapy as you can and include your husband often.  Its hard seeing someone you relied on as a protector &amp; supporter as someone who has become so selfish and irrational.   It is hard.  Dont let yourself downplay it. Mourn it.  Know you will grow. You will get through this.  Hugs*

&gt;&gt; You've articulated exactly how I feel. I feel like I'm grieving multiple deaths--but they didn't die. They chose to leave me alone so they could join a hateful cult. ""We can do hard things"" has been post-it noted multiple places in our house. We have each other, our wee clan, and that will be enough to get through this year.

&gt; *I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Defend your boundaries as if your life depends on it. That will likely anger them. Do it anyway. It's your best means of protecting yourself and your (nuclear) family. They can choose to forego vaccines. You can choose to deny access to your baby. It's that simple. There's also no reason to apologize for keeping your family safe. Every conservative I know loves the KISS method: Keep It Short and Simple. The shortest answer is ""No."" Period.*

&gt;&gt; I have a lot to do in that arena. This would've been the case pandemic or not, but becoming a parent has revealed to me how much I struggle with boundaries and giving people a firm ""no"". Hoping to build that skill through some self-work and therapy.

&gt; *What a sad story and I'm really sorry that this has happened to you. But you have to count your blessings. You have your son and you have your husband. One of the biggest things in life that we eventually have to do is learn to accept the things that we cannot change. While it's a real bummer you are just going to have to accept it and move on. Find a new support system. I'm sorry seeming harsh but it really is the only way that you're going to regain your sanity and move on with your life. You can always hope that your family will get better. And you can do things to try and help them. But probably none of those things will do any good over arching.  So you are going to have to accept that. I wish you so much love and send you so many hugs. All my best.* 

&gt;&gt; It's funny you mention that because one of my self-stated goals for therapy is ""try to find acceptance that I can't change my family's views, and that I am capable of moving forward without their support or approval"". I'm confident I'll get there but am still grieving the loss of those relationships.

&gt; *I have to give you props for such a well thought out and highly articulate post. When you experience your doubts, I suggest you try to imagine those you are struggling with making such cogent and reasonably emotive arguments. Best of luck.*

&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for the compliment. Funny you mention that--we've been told multiple times that we're keeping him away from people because we're ""paranoid"" and ""manipulated by fear tactics"". When in reality, we've based our decisions off of conversations with multiple doctors/health professionals, weekly check-ins on our local infection rates, and weighing the risk/benefits of different kinds of social situations and interactions. Whereas our family bases their decisions off of pithy memes on social media. It's impossible to reason with them.

&gt; *Wow!  Your story is one of the saddest Ive read on here.  Congratulations on your new baby.  You are doing all you can to protect your child.  It sounds like you both are great parents.  The Q people believe some crazy things.  There mental health is really messed up.  I lost a man I had been in a relationship for 7 years to Q.  The last time I saw him his eyes looked soulless.  It seems so hopeless I know, but you are not alone.  We are all out here feeling like what the heck is happening.  Cling to friends and neighbors who share your beliefs.  Its a cult.  You are right in your ideologies and fierce in protecting your child.  Dont doubt yourself.  Peace and love.*

&gt;&gt; I'm so sorry to hear about your partner. One thing that's made me sad is not just what Q has done to my familial relationships, but is also knowing that my family is living in such a terrifying non-reality. The world that they've constructed and bought into is so full of fear and anger. It's sucked the joy and kindness from their hearts at a rapid speed. Hoping you find peace and companionship with people who lift you up &lt;3

#[My Q best friend got vaccinated =L](https://redd.it/ox3fpu)  - /r/QAnonCasualties - August 2021

I just saw someone else's post on their Q Mom getting vaccinated, and wanted to share about my friend who got the J&amp;J vaccine two days ago. I wish it was because she saw the light of reason, but it was because the hospital she's temporarily working at (she's a travel RN--why are so many nurses believing conspiracy theories?!?!) mandated them. She complained afterwards of her arm being numb and she was convinced she was going to have a stroke...but lo and behold, she's just fine. 

The other person who convinced her to get vaccinated was her sister, who has been far more empathetic and caring of her Q family than I have. Qfriend approached her the other day and asked her to help calm her fears about getting vaccinated because she ""was a reasonable person who hasn't judged her"". 

This made me pause. I know a lot of us have a lot of righteous, understandable anger. And I know there are many circumstances where this approach wouldn't work. But there may be some people who are still on the cusp of seeing reason and need more kind and empathetic people who can guide them. I thought for sure my Qfriend was long gone, and had cut our contact down to almost nothing. She still believes in a lot of crazy things, but she's vaccinated now. And fine. And the longer she goes being fine, I wonder if there's a possibility that she'll question some of the Covid misinformation she's bought into.

Also: WE NEED MORE VACCINE MANDATES. THEY WORK.

&gt; *Im sorry but I have no intention of going out of my way to be nice to people that call me names and treat me like crap. Im absolutely done turning the other cheek.  And if someone catches covid because I wasnt nice enough to them to beg them to get vaccinated thats on them.*

&gt;&gt; Oh completely hear you on that front. I've been angry to the point of needing therapy the last couple months. We had a baby this year and have been completely abandoned by our support system that went Q. That being said, there may be some folks who still have it in them to try and persuade their Q family/friends and this was a technique that worked in the end.

&gt; *Its hard not be angry. This choice has created an incubator for the Delta variant. It isnt just a personal choice, its a choice that affects everyone. And having a kid under 12 being in greater danger because of this nonsense makes it hard to be sympathetic.*

&gt;&gt; With you 1000%. We had a baby this year and the people in our lives who went Q have made this experience incredibly sad and difficult. For the folks out there who still have some energy to try and persuade Q followers this was one approach that worked in the end.

#[My mom thinks she's in a war](https://redd.it/pcnczn) - /r/QAnonCasualties - August 2021

My mom slowly progressed to Qanon ever since she and my family started attending Calvary Chapel Chino Hills (a fundamentalist evangelical megachurch) about a year and a half ago. She hasn't seen my infant son (her first grandchild) in months because she refuses to get vaccinated, and won't meet me in the middle at ALL by hanging out outdoors, socially distanced. 

I've been working so hard to salvage our relationship, and part of that has involved trying to empathize with her fears and values. So I watched her church service online. The pastor, Jack Hibbs, said at least a half dozen times that Christians are in a war. He raged about mask mandates and the CA recall. About how the church was being persecuted in Afghanistan. That the end times are here. His ""sermon"" was mostly politics. But his words and tone was very clear: we're in a war. It's time to take a side.

I texted her this week: ""I'm really, really sad. I miss my mom. I miss my best friend. My world has felt turned upside down ever since we fell out of alignment with one another. I'm trying really hard to learn and understand your perspective. I'm trying to find common ground. I've been reading and listening to viewpoints that are opposed to mine. I want to fight for our relationship, but not with one another. I feel like the world is trying to convince us we're at war with one another, and I vehemently refuse that. I love you, mom.""

But I've received the silent treatment in return. I needed my mom so badly this year after having my first child. I tried so hard to be kind, and understanding, and empathetic. 

I know there will be a sentiment of ""that's her loss"". But that doesn't change how completely brokenhearted I am. I feel so abandoned and rejected. I miss my mom.

Update: Wow. I feel enveloped in affirmations and warmth. Thank you so much to everyone who took the time to send me a message. It really filled my tank up. In other news, I filed an official complaint with the IRS against the church for being involved in a political campaign. They have the whole service on their website, so it was pretty easy to show hard proof of what happened. You think we're in a war? Cool, hope you get to battle it out with the IRS, Jack Hibbs.

#[Do you think our Q relationships will ever go back to what they were?](https://redd.it/pfymvp) - /r/QAnonCasualties - September 2021

I was talking to a friend about this today. SO MANY PEOPLE we know, both on forums like this and in our own communities, have been negatively impacted by the alt-right, conspiracy touting, Covid-denying, Q-adjacents or Q believers in their lives.

As of two years ago, my mom was one of my best friends. Not only have I gone low contact with her, I'm not sure our relationship will ever recover from the pain she's put me through this year. Then there are the aunts, uncles, cousins, and friends I've lost to Q as well. While we always had our share of differences in opinions, we are now a family torn in half. 

When I think of the scale of people experiencing the same exact thing, it kind of blows my mind. What happens when Covid becomes an endemic, and no longer controls our daily narrative? When the world moves on? Do you think any of our relationships will recover, or do you think most people who fell down this rabbit hole are forever lost to us? 

I think about the countless families and relationships that have been blown to smithereens over all of this. I feel like the alt-right has created an irreparable chasm in this country that may never heal.

#[Upcoming meeting with Qmom--advice?](https://redd.it/psm0yf) - /r/QAnonCasualties - September 2021

I've been low contact with my Qmom for the last few months because of her increasingly fringe beliefs. I have a 10-month old son, and my mom is not vaccinated, attends a maskless megachurch every week, and generally refuses to wear a mask or respect my desire to socially distance.

Lately, she's shown a desire to meet me in the middle because she misses me and my son (which feels sincere). She proposed meeting at a park for lunch, so we can be outdoors. So far it looks like she's also willing to wear a mask.

I was so happy at the prospect of her showing some ability to compromise, but I'm also feeling nervous that I'm walking into a trap. Am I crazy for feeling this way? Am I being foolish for softening my boundaries? Is there anything I should be prepared for?

Appreciate any words of wisdom. This community has been so helpful and deeply healing for me.

#[Upcoming meeting with Qmom--UPDATE](https://redd.it/pvutil) - /r/QAnonCasualties - September 2021

I want to thank everyone for their advice on my previous post. I did end up bringing my son with me, but had multiple escape plans ready to go in case I needed them.

Here are the positives: Qmom suggested meeting at the park, because I'm only comfortable with outdoor situations. She wore her mask. She did not ask if she could hold the baby. She stayed at a reasonable distance from us. All in all, HUGE victories there.

The negatives: man, I'm really worried about her. She was very fidgety, and kept suspiciously looking back and forth at people walking by the park. ""I'm just so vigilant about keeping you and Baby safe,"" she said. ""Child trafficking is the worst it's ever been."" 

The visit also kind of came to an abrupt end when it seemed she couldn't find anything to talk about other than the vaccine. I work at a school that mandated the vaccine for all employees and students who are eligible. She asked me if that was true, which I confirmed, and then she proceeded to get teary-eyed. She thinks we're all going to suffer from cancer and disease in the upcoming years because we got the jab. All those innocent children who go to my school.

She also just doesn't seem like my mom anymore. She's always been an emotional roller coaster, but she was still spunky and youthful and full of life. I could always make her laugh. Now, she seems deeply suspicious and scared. 

So, it definitely could've been way worse, and I'm very thankful that she respected my boundaries. But even though I saw my mom yesterday in person, I feel like I miss her more than ever. 

I miss my mom.

&gt; *And the problem is she gets confirmation bias from all the others who have been indoctrinated online. Social media has become a scourge on America and the world. Now they get banned from one platform for spreading lies and they just go join another one. Youre doing the right thing. Keep your distance and hope she eventually realizes why you wont see her and comes to her senses about it. Im not religious but Ive always liked the serenity prayer. I hope you find serenity.*

&gt;&gt; Ever since she started going to a conservative mega church (Calvary Chapel Chino Hills) and joined alt-right social media sites (she's on Parler and I think Gab?), it's been a rapid and steep decline. She's never been political for as long as she's been my mom, and now it's all she talks about. She also doesn't even consider herself a republican anymore--she's ""conservative"".

&gt; *There's probably still some hope if she's capable of empathy.  The worst of them seem to enjoy the idea of the rest of us dying horribly from the vaccine and leaving them to rule the world.  You might be able to use that empathy to draw her out of it if you work at it.*

&gt;&gt; That's what I'm holding onto right now. Every once in a while I get a glimpse of my loving mom who cares for the people around her. I just hope we find our way back to each other in time.

#[This is the stuff megachurches are sending their congregations ](https://redd.it/pwks97) - /r/Qult_Headquarters - September 2021

This article was shared by multiple family members this weekend, and it was first sent to them by pastor Jack Hibbs, who runs Calvary Chapel Chino Hills, a megachurch in southern California. I woke up with the energy this week to push back, but it's a long piece with a lot of bad information. Where do I start?

[Archived coffeeandcovid.com link](https://web.archive.org/web/20220915150028/https://www.coffeeandcovid.com/p/what-the-church-needs-to-know-about-covid-19-2307dc2a111c)

#[I thought going NC would be brutal; instead, I find myself breathing a lot easier.](https://redd.it/r5sbxn) - /r/QAnonCasualties - November 2021

My relationship with my Qmom has been slowly disintegrating over the past year due to her increasingly fringe beliefs around covid (my previous posts have more details). I had my first child this year, and she refused to get vaccinated. But she also struggled with wearing a mask or social distancing when she was around us (couldn't go more than two minutes without complaining or trying to convince us Covid wasn't ""real""), so our in-person visits became far and few between.

My goal this past year, with the help from a therapist, has been to keep the peace as much as possible so when my son had his opportunity to be vaccinated, we could still have a relationship. But she got to the point where we couldn't even have a phone conversation without her becoming antagonistic. She thinks anyone who is sick right now is because they got vaccinated. Anyone who has died--probably because of the vaccine. Covid is somehow not real, and also a bioweapon designed by China to control the US. Simultaneously it was also all a well-orchestrated plan by the Dems to see how many of our freedoms we would be willing to give up.

During our last phone conversation I asked her if she brought her concerns about the vaccine to her doctor. She said, ""My doctor was the one who TOLD me NOT to get vaccinated! He was very concerned about the VAERS reports."" I couldn't play ball anymore. I told her I had a hard time believing that story (we've spoken with many, many doctors this year and every single one of them was pro-vaccine). She proceeded to have a massive, hysterical meltdown. I was brainwashed and arrogant and no longer the daughter she recognized. How dare I accuse her of being a liar, after all of the research she's done. There were many horrible things that she said, but the straw that broke the camel's back: my son, who has had multiple daycare viruses, apparently has a broken immune system because we shed the vaccine to him. And if we got him vaccinated, we would have to live with the damage we've caused him.

I have no energy or capacity to entertain her dangerous, hateful beliefs anymore. **I deserve peace.** My baby deserves a mom who is present and happy. So finally, FINALLY, I decided to go no contact.

I had held off on making this decision because of the ""family comes first"" mentality, but let me tell you--I think it may be one of the best decisions I've ever made. I didn't realize how much of her toxicity I had been absorbing until I cut her out of my life.

The family I am building will be breaking generational curses. If you disturb my peace you are no longer welcome in my space.

To the folks on here who are being perpetually hurt by their Q loved ones and are stuck in limbo: you cant continue to allow people to cause you emotional harm and keep them around by saying thats just how they are. **You deserve peace.** You deserve healing. You deserve authentic, reciprocated love. It is OK to establish boundaries. It is OK to demand that others treat you with respect. You are allowed to build the life that is best for you, even if it means removing individuals or changing your relationship with them to make it a reality.

Also: it may not be your place, and is most likely not worth your energy, to try and change your Q loved ones minds. The distorted reality they are living is so far out of reach for most of us who are untrained in navigating cult-like behaviors. If you needed permission, here it is: it's OK to let them go, even if you are sure they are not well. You don't have to save them. **You deserve peace.**

This community has been a place of healing and affirmation for me, and I want to thank all of you for your advice and help over the past year. I'm sending you back peace and love and hope for a brighter future for all of us. &lt;3

&gt; *Great post! I truly believe it's our job to break abusive or dysfunctional family cycles. Usually takes being responsible for your own children to make that break. I do everything I can to keep my family engaged and to think critically, even if it goes against my own personal beliefs and biases.* [...] *On another note: NC doesn't have to be forever. So as you process your decision, leave open the possibility of a relationship, on your terms. Based on mutual respect. Leaving open a possibility of reconnecting, lessons the severity of ""forever"" which might be  very hard to reconcile in your heart. Stay safe, and sane. Your post means a lot to many people.*

&gt;&gt; I so appreciate this. The parting words I left her with was ""I hope one day we're able to find our way back to one another."" My hope is that, in time, many of the conspiracies she believes in will cease to come true--there are only so many times the goal posts can move before people start to question. But until then, I need to move on with my life, and focus on being the best parent I can be.

Here's a list of the most recent updates.","When the pandemic began, it felt like a wave of updates started happening across the board for Does, cold cases et cetera. I wanted to log as many as I could last year and created **[this update](https://old.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/msmfcg/a_comprehensive_list_of_does_cold_cases_solved/)**.

Since then I have gone on to mostly catalogue John &amp; Jane Doe updates; **[update 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/pugx5l/a_comprehensive_look_at_updated_cases_does_cold/), [update 3](https://old.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/qihrl0/46_does_have_been_given_their_names_back_since/) &amp; [update 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/w7tc3a/58_jane_john_does_have_been_identified_since/).**

&amp;nbsp;

With the year coming to a close, here's a list of the most recent Doe updates since my last post four months ago. I ended up listing **75 DOES** who had been identified back then. In the four months since, I have collated a further **53 IDENTIFIED DOES**. 

&amp;nbsp;

53 Does whose real identities have been revealed in the past four months is phenomenal really. That's around **three per week!!!** 

&amp;nbsp;

And it is more than likely a lot more than that because I have undoubtedly missed out on names who either haven't had a write up on here or whose cases aren't widely known (international Does for example, as these catalogues are heavily American-skewed).

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wwn4c6/aita_for_calling_a_baby_it/)**: August 24, 2022**

For context, I have nothing against kids, I even want them someday, but this isnt the time for me personally.

So my friend Natalia and I are both in our mid 20s. Natalia is currently pregnant with her second child and is around 28 weeks? Im not too sure though. Whenever her baby comes up in conversation, there have been times where I have said comments such as I wonder if IT will have you eyes, or IT will be so cute. Natalia at the time made no indication that this bothered her so I didnt give it a second thought. This has been happening since she announced her pregnancy and I am not the only one to use the word it, she has also not revealed the gender or name.

A few weeks ago, a mutual friend asked if I am attending her baby shower, I said I am working. I then made the comment I dont get why shes having a baby shower, IT is her second baby, she already had a shower + gender reveal in 2019. I do understand needing some new items such as a car seat but the list also included MANY items she previously got at her first shower such as new baby monitors, an (IMO) expensive stroller, etc. But I kept this comment to myself.

Natalia reached out to me the other day and I called the baby an it again.

Natalia then got upset with me and said it was an AH move to keep calling her baby an It, as a baby isnt an object and she hopes this doesnt continue once the baby is born. I will admit, until she told us her baby names for baby 1, I also called the baby an it, until she decided on a name if it would either be a boy or a girl with the same starting initial so it became Baby R until baby was born. Since baby 1 was born, he was called by his name.

I apologized and said I didnt know my actions offended her, but she didnt accept my apology and still maintains I am an AH.

So AITA? It honestly wasnt out of malice, just unsure what to call her baby at this time.

EDIT/Clarification:

I never have misgendered a person and know the harm in calling a person, especially a member of the LGBTQ+ community an it. I would NEVER call any person that.

Unborn babies were the only situation in which if I didnt know the pronouns/pronoun route the parents decided to go with, or name or ANYTHING, I and others close to me used the term it.

Did friend tell Natalia baby shower comment?

No. Weve been friends since we were babies, she at the time agree with my comment and said first time moms during pandemic/lockdown - makes sense for a do-over shower. I did double check, shes NEVER lied to me before, and this isnt something Id be upset over and she knows that.

Other than Natalia, our group is still adjusting from the shit, im pregnant to yay! im pregnant, were learning, were new to this whole thing.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xg6has/update_aita_for_calling_a_baby_an_it/)**: September 16, 2022**

Hey! So on my last post, the comments were pretty divided on calling my friend Nats baby an it.

After giving her a few days to cool off, I reached out and asked if everything was ok. It turns out that Nat was upset that we (our friend group) kinda made a bigger deal of her first pregnancy (and first baby of our group). She went on to explain how she felt like if one of us announced we were pregnant it will be a bigger deal compared to her being pregnant right now.

She was also upset that most of us RSVPd no to her 2nd baby shower that she had to plan and organize herself. And she feels left behind as shes a SAHM and the rest of us are moving away for work, higher education, and to where we want to live.

I asked if she was bothered by me calling the bébé an it and turns out she wasnt, I just caught her at a bad moment and everything just boiled up for her.

So yeah I explained that we didnt really know a second baby shower was a thing, thats why we didnt think of it, and I couldnt make it to the one she planned due to a work trip.

End of the day, were good. Still love each other and the two lil ones. And as a few people suggested im putting together a little bag of baby items for the little one - so any suggestions welcome for what to put in!

Thanks yall!

edit:

thank you all for the amazing suggestions!! Im loving the ideas coming in.

To clarify a few things - since my last post I have just been calling the baby they baby (also sometimes the bébé because we used to binge Schitts Creek)

She wanted a baby shower for her 2nd baby (not 2 for same pregnancy). A lot of the items she did ask for this time around were more expensive (imo idk how much baby stuff should cost) such as a 2k baby stroller, new crib, etc. Maybe I am off base on how much stuff costs. But the stroller and other items did seem a little pricy to me.

Yes she does still have a lot of her original stuff as she planned to have her children closer together (2nd end of 2020/ early 2021) but everything happened.","BestofRedditorUpdates",3376,3376,0,0.96,0,0,2,676

Since his birth, he's been in and out of hospital &amp; has had multiple health issues. He was born with jaundice and ended up having an exchange transfusion to help clean the red blood cells. While I was waiting for an appointment for his surgery on his feet (bilateral talipes), he caught sickness bug off my oldest (3m). I thought it was a cold but ended up taking him to hospital after 24 hour &amp; it was RSV. I panicked as he was back in NICU for a bit.

Now, he's on the mend and was discharged from hospital 2 week ago. I was going to shop with my kids when someone approached and struck up conversation up about kids. I don't like talking to strangers anyway but was polite enough. This stranger then tried to put their hands on my new son. I told them nicely but firmly to not touch the baby. They ignored and did it anyway. I then moved quickly (baby in sling) &amp; maybe shouted ""I said DONT touch my baby!"" This stranger then told me how disrespectful my generation is &amp; how back in those days everyone did it and how I'm just going to raise disrespectful children. Telling me I'm just a kid having kids &amp; that I shouldn't speak to my elders like I did. They reached out again &amp; ended up brushing their finger against my baby's cheek and bottom lip. I was livid and really shouted, rather loudly ""hands off my child!"" This person said that I'm an awful person to speak to someone like I did and then walked off muttering something I didn't quite hear.

Now, we've just come out of pandemic and I don't know this person nor their hygiene routine and I don't want randoms touching my kids.

I asked my friend if I'm TA and she said I shouldn't have shouted, I am the ta for doing that when I could've stayed calm, that the person is probably harmless &amp; it's just how people are where we are (lil county South England) &amp; it's normal here where it isn't where I am from. 

AITA?


Update - thankyou everyone for your replies. I have read through them. After reading the replies, I then showed them to my (now ex) friend who still maintains that she is right while I'm wrong. She also added that maybe I'm psychologically ill hence why I can't see why I am TA. This is when I cut all ties as she knows I had postpartum psychosis with my oldest and I've maintained good mental health with the right support in order to keep well. Deep down, I knew I was in the right (I'm always second guessing myself) as I did calmly ask beforehand but it all fell on deaf ears.

At the time, it was me and my two older sisters, one of which was already an adult - so my other sister and I were left under my mother's custody due to my father always flying and not wanting us to go through moving all the time. As far as the details go, my dad not only paid my mom child support but also paid off the house. Despite having little money to take care of himself, he paid my mom *more* than what he actually owed. 

Yet, my sister and I never saw that money. After the divorce, my mom turned to many things - sleeping around, gambling, drinking, and eventually meth (though that didn't last long due to my dad finding out and threatening to take us away). My sister practically became my mother since ours decided to step down from the plate and I was too young to take care of myself. 

When my sister left for college, all the emotional abuse she took ended up falling on me, which sent me into a loop. Due to my sister taking all the damage, I typically saw my mother as... well, my mother! My young brain didn't notice how often she didn't come home at night or the lack of food in the house or the constant weeks I'd wear one outfit since I didn't have other clothes that fit - I didn't notice how not normal this is. Heading into high school, it became more and more obvious this wasn't right at all, yet I still loved my mother. We bantered and ate fast food together and she was proud of my accomplishments! But she had her moments - dropping huge hints that I'm too boyish like my dad, refusing to let me cut my hair, pressuring me into wearing makeup, heels, dresses, convincing me I don't need therapy as my therapist at the time made me uncomfortable (one of those Christian therapists that made everything about God - while I am a Christian, it didn't help the conversation), and so on. 

Meanwhile, my dad met a woman and they fell in love. When she became pregnant with his kid, he moved her to America after my little sister was born and started a new family. I love my step-mom (she's literally the sweetest woman I know) and I adore my baby sister (and eventually my second baby sister!). Over time, after spending many nights in their home, I came to realize how much happier I was at their house over my mother's. One day, I told my dad I want to officially live with him (at this point in time, I've noticed how depressed I am and how things aren't normal in my mom's house). When I told my mother this, she was deeply upset and cried, but she understood (or so I thought). 

That's when everything went downhill. The text messages started - sly guilt trips and remarks on how someone else convinced me to move out, that my father convinced me she was the bad guy. The more these texts happened, the warier I became on talking to her. It got to the point where I would cry after every conversation because I was so confused and lost. One day, she practically trapped me in her car in my best friend's driveway to tell me how my reasons for leaving her were bullshit and that I clearly don't remember what it was like in that house. Cue my memory issues! 

But enough about that - let's get to the good part: the custody case. Due to me being the last child between my mother and father, my dad no longer had to pay child support. Obviously, they go to court about this. Except my mom didn't show up. For many, many hearings. When she did, she had this bullshit story about how my dad owed her a shitload of money because he never paid the full child support, how she felt pressured to believe him and trust him when he said he knew how much he owed her (he did. he calculated it himself and actually paid more than what was needed). So, if you're catching on, this fight was about money. 

Here's a fun little thing - my mom texted me maybe a month before this case started about how she desperately wants me to come home, how she will do *anything* to get her baby back. That aged well, didn't it? Because one day, my mom stated that if my dad pays her 2500 dollars, she will give up full custody of me. My dad agreed to it and it was over - she gave up her custody rights for 2500 dollars. 

It still stings. I'm still bitter and angry to this day about it, and this case happened years ago. I don't think my mom is aware I know the details on this case as she (very rarely) reaches out to me as if we still have a relationship to tell me how much she loves and misses me. The thing is I learned that my mom actually despised me after the divorce because I reminded her of my dad (we have the same eyes and resting face lol). My mom just loves being the victim and even tried to convince my sister she ""doesn't remember doing all the stuff she did to us."" She even blamed my dad for her cheating on him and said so to my face! I haven't had a real conversation with her since Christmas (over the phone ofc) and haven't seen her in person since maybe before the pandemic. She texted me recently all excited about a gift she got for my sister's unborn baby and it sent a whole new wave of resentment towards her. I stopped trying long ago to have a relationship with her as she doesn't try in return and will continue to do so until she admits her wrongs, apologizes, and actually tries to be a fucking mother for once in her life. Until then, my only mother is my lovely step-mom &lt;3","entitledparents",3311,3311,0,0.99,2,0,0,103

I (33M) have NC with my parents (72M retired and 65F about to retire) and siblings for about 1.5 years now, but I have always been sending my parents money on the 1st of every month ever since I graduated college and got a job. I increased this amount as my career progressed, so as of 2020, I was sending them both $1000 each. This continued through the pandemic and my wedding (which I paid for myself without any parental support). I've also been paying for the internet service at my parents' house since I started working after college. For context, the currency in my home country is such that an average meal + drink in the business district costs $10. Outside the city this can go down to $5-6. 

My decision to cut off contact was due primarily to wanting to escape from their narcissistic ideology that children belong to their parents, which was made all the worse when my father attempted to enforce this on my wife 1.5 years ago after we got married.

More recently, my wife and I moved to a different country for my work, and we gave birth to our baby daughter there. With all the changes to our financial situation, it was getting too difficult to maintain the monthly sum that I was remitting back to my parents. Calculating the cost of raising a kid (including her college fund), having a family (my wife is a homemaker) as well as the medical bills made it very clear that I would only be able to sustain the arrangement if I terminated the internet plan and reduced the amount I was sending them to $300.

I sent an email to my parents detailing the planned changes and my reasons for reducing the amounts. The reply from my father began with the fact that he had spent so much money raising me and sending me through college, that it was ""only right"" that I maintained the monthly $1000 payments. Along with it also came a tirade of guilt-tripping phrases such as ""not telling us about the birth of **our granddaughter**"" and some thinly-veiled threatening ones like ""I will come to &lt;location&gt; to visit you our dear son.""

The email conversation was not pretty, and brought up a lot of old hurts that were the reason I went NC in the first place. At the end of it all my father's final response still had the following words: ""do send the $1k"".

I understand that I have a debt to repay for the years of upbringing, but it is really getting to the point where the concept of blind filial piety is beginning to feel like egoistic nonsense.

The arrival of **Chewy**(NYSE:[**CHWY**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/chwy-stock-quote/)) founder Ryan Cohen as chairman, and the hiring of [new management](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/09/tech/gamestop-new-ceo-cfo/index.html)from **Amazon.Com** (NASDAQ:[**AMZN**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amzn-stock-quote/)) caused many of those investors to believe a turnaround was imminent.

Its not. When the companys Christmas quarter numbers came out in March, it reported anemic growth of 6% year-over-year, and [a loss of $381 million, $5.25 per share.](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2021-results)  Beyond [a stock split](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-ryan-cohens-clever-plan-to-limit-shareholder-dilution) that only seems to benefit management, nothing has changed.

The Bull Case for GME Stock

The bull case for Gamestop starts with a failure, cloud gaming.

**Alphabet** (NASDAQ:[**GOOG**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/goog-stock-quote/), [**GOOGL**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/googl-stock-quote/)) promised to transform the industry with its [Google Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/), but its looking increasingly like just another app store. Theres too much latency, too much time between you mashing a button and your opponent across town being able to respond. Even in the U.S., which has half the worlds cloud data centers, local networks are slow and expensive.

This means theres still a niche for retailers who sell physical games and game machines. Gamestop fills that niche. But the niche should decline over time. Cloud gaming is coming.

No one wants to bet against Gamestop, however, or especially short it, given [what happened to **Melvin Capital**](https://nypost.com/2022/05/02/melvin-capital-down-23-3-year-to-date-as-founder-looks-to-shut-down-fund/), which led the shorts last year. Even today, shorts are [in an uncomfortable position](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/gamestop-stock-short-sellers-are-not-in-a-comfortable-position) as retail investors continue to support the stock.

### The Bear Case for GME Stock

The question is, why?

Cohen has turned his attention to **Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond** (NASDAQ:[**BBBY**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/bbby-stock-quote/)), the home goods retailer. After taking a position in the stock, he convinced the board [to seek a sale](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bed-bath-beyond-inc-announces-cooperation-agreement-ryan-cohen), first of its Buy Buy Baby unit, then possibly the whole company. He turned into just the kind of Wall Street shark he once criticized, taking out companies to take them apart.

What of Matt Furlong, the hotshot Amazon executive hired as CEO? He made [$16.7 million](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-ceo-matt-furlong-got-paid-16-8-million-in-2021-for-a-half-year-of-work-11649783285) for a half-year of work, but he has done nothing to improve operations. Since dropping chief operating officer Jenna Owens [late last year](https://www.retaildive.com/news/gamestop-coo-is-out-after-7-months-on-the-job/609218/), the only release Gamestop has sent out about operations concerns [a token for NFTs](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-forms-partnership-immutable-x).

Bulls talk about insiders buying, about the stock split and about Gamestop having [meme stock power.](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/gme/3-reasons-to-buy-gamestop-stock)  What does the last even mean? It seems to mean that the small investors who bought the meme arent abandoning the name. But thats not a business case.

Professional analysts have given up on Gamestop. *Tipranks* lists just one, who wants you to [sell it.](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/gme/forecast) Their price target is $30/share, 75% below where its trading on May 3.

### The Bottom Line

There are very few retailers that sell at a premium to their sales. **Costco Wholesale**(NASDAQ:[**COST**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/cost-stock-quote/)) does and so does **Target** (NYSE:[**TGT**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/tgt-stock-quote/)). **Walmart** (NYSE:[**WMT**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/wmt-stock-quote/)) sells for about 73% of sales, and **Home Depot** (NYSE:[**HD**](https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/hd-stock-quote/)) for about 40% of sales.

Gamestop is losing money and sells for 1.5 times its sales. The valuation makes no sense. Full year sales in fiscal 2022, which ended in January, were 20% ahead of a year before. But they were also $450 million behind where they were in the pre-pandemic year of 2020.

When there are so many good stocks selling at deep discounts to the value of their businesses, Gamestop stands out. Not in a good way. Its priced way above other retailers, and its not a tech stock, even though it sells software and chip-laden game machines.

My advice is that you walk away. Do it quietly. Dont tell anyone until youre out. But sell, now. If you got in early, take your winnings. If you got in late, accept your losses. But sell.","Superstonk",3084,3084,0,0.95,4,0,0,482

We've been fully divorced since about right before the pandemic started. We sold the house we shared and I didn't have to pay her alimony because she cheated and we're in an at-fault state. It was messy since D-Day. All of the stereotypes. First the sobbing and then trickle truths saying ""***I love you!***"" ""***It was just one time!***"" ""***Ok it was two years!***"". And then the gaslighting followed by ""***I'm going to take you for everything!***"" before packing her shit and walking out. I feel like I never really knew the woman my ex was in all the time we were together. We were married five years and together for seven. And in two of those five married years she had affairs with 3 other men. The final one being a foreign business man of some sort from what I could find out. Yes I got tested for STDs and was thankfully negative. Yes she got pregnant by the final AP, and no I didn't sign the birth certificate because I found out about the all affairs before the baby was born thanks to a call from the first AP. My ex tried to go full scorched earth on me. But since we live in and were married in an at-fault state, she lost. We didn't pay equally into our house, and the equity was divided 70/30. So I got a pretty good cash payout when I sold our marital home to put as a down payment on a different house closer to my job. It's a bit of a downgrade. But suits a single guy in his thirties like me just fine.

My ex did show up to my house once. But I refused to let her in. She bitched at me that I'd financially ruined her in the divorce. I said that if she was fully willing to do that to me first, and the bitch had the audacity to say it should have been my life fucked over, and not hers. I laughed so hard and said it was karma. She yelled that she'd sue me for what was rightfully hers. I said if she was gonna sue me, then to go ahead and sue me. It'd end up the same way in court because she has nothing but a false sob story. She was the cheater, not me. I'm no angel, but I didn't do anything to her. And she was the one who ruined our marriage. She then said she'd tell everyone she could that I abused her. I said I'd sue her for defamation if she did, and I was recording our interaction and had those words saved to my phone. She went wide-eyed and her jaw dropped. The look people are calling the surprised Pikachu face. Then I asked why she was there, if not to just try and make trouble. Because she had a new man in her life that knocked her up. She just huffed at me and said he isn't around much, and she's stuck in a tiny apartment living off his child support till he comes back. It was immature of me I know, but I did the bit of playing the world's smallest violin. She yelled at me to go fuck myself, and I yelled back that I'd sooner do that than her any time. She raged at me and then got in her car to leave. Haven't seen her since.

There is an HOA in my neighborhood. But I was not legally obligated to join it because the last owner of my house was not a member. I made sure of that through a real estate lawyer as well. The HOA had no grounds to force me to join, and were not happy about it. The HOA president would show up with forms every week for the first month demanding I sign them. Then she threatened to take me to court. To which I had to get a C&amp;D sent to her from my lawyer to make her stop that. So she started harassing me by looking for any infractions she possibly could to report to the city. An inspector came out several times and found nothing wrong. In fact I offered one of them a burger while grilling, and they graciously accepted. Did I mention the HOA hates barbecues and parties that aren't approved in advance? Well they do. And I like to grill when the weather is good. And my neighbors actually love me for it because I invite them over.

I had the police called on me several times for noise complaints because I was playing music on a Saturday afternoon while having my friends over. The HOA president I caught trespassing once when she was trying to peer into my windows. I called the police, but she denied ever doing it. So I got cameras. She hasn't trespassed since. But I still got repeated passive aggressive letters saying my cameras were not an approved addition to my house.

Some months ago I started getting letters for fines in the mail. And when I contacted the HOA, their representative claimed they had it on record that I'd joined, and needed to pay all fees effective immediately. I told them that was not possible. Then they emailed a scanned copy of the forms, and they had a signature on them. But it was not mine. It was very similar in some ways, and I recognized right away as being my ex's handwriting. She knew what my signature looked like. But it was a loose imitation at best. I got in touch with a lawyer right away over the forged signature. But the HOA still demanded to go to court. And it took seven months before that happened. Meanwhile they were stacking unpaid fines against me weekly, and were threatening to put a lien on my house.

We went to court and the HOA president looked very smug. But my lawyer pointed out how the signature wasn't the same as mine, and was very inconsistent in the various forms. I'd never allowed the HOA president in my house, and I'd never requested the forms. The idiot HOA president actually slammed her palm on the table and said it was still binding. But when pressed where the fraudulent signature came from, she admitted my ex wife called the HOA and they sent her the forms, then got them back in the mail signed. But then she actually claimed she'd thought I'd signed them. The judge looked at her and asked if she was serious. She confirmed she was. The judge then asked how a woman I was no longer married to, that had never even lived with me in my current residence was supposed to have any bearing on whether or not I joined her HOA. She went quiet and I could see the ""***OH SHIT!***"" look on her face as the hamster wheels were turning and she seemed to finally mentally put the pieces together.

My lawyer then counterclaimed that what the HOA did was blatant fraud, and legal actions must be taken. And they were. I countersued the HOA for the emotional distress of the harassment I'd gotten since moving in. Which I had lots of proof of. That won me about ten grand after lawyer fees that I decided to put towards my mortgage. The HOA president was removed from her throne. I like to think she was kicking and screaming. She was also slapped with a hefty fine. I've seen her outside a few times, and she always looks at me like I am the devil. The HOA itself had to pay all of my legal fees too. I wanted to go after my ex for forging my signature. But can't because not long after she forged my signature on those forms, she apparently left the country to be with her third AP. She's somewhere in Europe from what I can see of the final posts on her FB before she disappeared. So I can't do anything against her unless she ever returns to the US. So that was a wash. I'm not getting letters from the HOA anymore though. And the new president has promised to keep things completely cordial from now on. I still don't feel like I got much of a win in this though. Other than the 10k payout it all felt like a huge waste of time.","EntitledPeople",3048,3048,0,0.99,3,0,2,160

Mind you, my mom is 64, has been a homemaker/stay-at-home-mom since 1992, and hasn't been part of the workforce since then. She refused, saying she's too old and that she already raised her kids. She also added that if I really wanted this baby, then maybe I should have thought about staying home like she did to take care of it while my partner goes to work and provides for us like a ""traditional"" family, and that if she any my dad were able to work it out, so can we. 

However, we are just coming out of a pandemic, going into a possible recession, there and there is no way me and my partner can make it financially on one income. I make $55k/yr, but have $39k in student loans + $20k in other debt (credit card, car loan, medical debt on credit). My partner makes about $36k/yr, and has $5k in credit card debt. I as the higher breadwinner, have an internal obligation to go back to work since not only i have the most at stake, I also make the most to keep our family afloat. We are currently in a small, 1 bedroom apartment in a metropolitan area, and would need to save money to move to a 2 bedroom once the baby grows up in a couple of years as we will need more space. 

When I explained all thr above to my mom, she then proceeded to say that she will charge me $20/hr for each hour she takes care of the baby, plus late fees if we are late for pickup, and must provide her with a carseat, stroller, bottles, and pretty much double of everything we have at our home to compensate for taking the baby to her house. She will not step foot in my house for her own personal reasons (she's come in once, and I've lived with my partner for 5 years; she's a 15min drive away). 

I want to save money to bring down our debt, and don't want to pay her as much nor invest as much in double of everything as it will spiral into more debt for me and my partner. I'm on the fence about enrolling my baby into an infant daycare instead as the cost will overall be lower and a little closer to our home. Due to our jobs, we cannot work from home so we are in desperate need of childcare. Everyone else in our family works full time so they cannot help us as they have a similar 9-5 schedule. 

So, am I the asshole for wanting my mom, who again is at home all day long (trust me, she does not do anything besides watch TV and cook meals), to take care of my baby for free while me and my partner try to fix our finances?","AmItheAsshole",3029,3029,0,0.88,3,0,2,2234

For context, my husband loves to travel and sometimes even does it solo. We went together in some countries and it was fun being with him doing so but I gotten pregnant over the pandemic so we sat down to talk about this because it was an accident. I've always wanted a baby anyways, just not this soon and my husband's reaction was expectedly caught off guard and had mixed emotions. We both took it as a sign and want to keep the baby but my husband says he still wants to travel and asked if im okay with it. My parents said they wanted to have a grandchild anyways and wanted it so bad that they even said they would watch him while we go out and have fun before I was even pregnant. So I knew my baby would be in good hands if we still travel so I said yes. We decided to go through this pregnancy.

Fast forward to now, our baby is 8 months and my husband is an incredible father. He hasnt been anywhere since the baby was born but he did occasionally talk about where to go next to travel. I honeslty thought at this point that he should stay home and be a father because he's a parent now. He shouldnt be gone even for a day away from our baby. I told him this and he got a bit upset. He wanted to think things through about this so he asked for a little mental space to not talk about the subject right now which I agreed. But then literally the next day, his college friend contacted him and invited him to a wedding to Taiwan. He told me this and said his friend was the one to helped him go through a lot in his college years and at least give him maybe 4 or 5 days to visit there. I still said no because things changed. My husband exploded and said that I broke the promise I made while I was pregnant. He kept telling me to give the baby to my parents to watch but I said we wouldnt be responsible parents if we do that. He kept claiming it's responsible because we know the baby will be safe but I kept arguing back that it doesnt work that way and I can really take him to court if he wants to abandon the baby. 

He broke his game system out of anger and gotten silent afterwards. He only communicated about baby related things but wouldnt talk to me about anything else. AITA?","AmItheAsshole",3016,3016,0,0.85,4,0,6,1940

Cuz that's what I'm currently going through! I'm proposing to my girlfriend of 2 years on Valentine's day which is also our anniversary! And I'm currently hiding in the bathroom while she's asleep so I can just cry about how much I love her without waking her up. We're pretty much recreating our first date and at the end as we're walking on the beach like we did on our first date, we're gonna walk up to this point where her family and friends will have set up a picnic table with a charcuterie board and the ring box. I'll then pick up the ring, get on one knee, tell her how much I love her and ask her to marry me! Her family and friends will be watching close by and will then come and celebrate with us on the beach. 2 of her friends that live in other states flew in to surprise her and to be here for it! I can't wait to see her face when she realizes we've all planned this out for months now and they took time off work to make it here and surprise her. She's the best person I've ever met and every day with her feels like the best day of my life as cheesy as that sounds. She makes the bad days not as bad. I never knew love could be this amazing until I met her. I never knew true love until I met her. I can not wait to spend the rest of my life with the woman of my dreams! This is a throwaway account so I figured this is the perfect place to just happy rant where I know she'll never see this post. I could text a friend all of this but it's been hard enough keeping the texts about the proposal secret/avoiding her seeing any info about it so reddit is the perfect place for late night happy rambles. Ok now I gotta collect myself and go cuddle my adorable sleeping soon to be fiance >p Edit: we've been talking about getting engaged for about a year now. We're both women and always joke about who's going to beat who to proposing first. I'm determined to propose first! She's always said I can never surprise her and on Monday I'm going to prove her wrong and I can't wait! There are so many surprises in store for her! But point is yes, were both definitely on the same page about what we want and I know she'll say yes(:

SHE SAID YES!!! I'd include pictures if I could but it says this community doesn't allow pictures. We went to the same restaurant we went to for our first date and after, we walked a local beach where her family a d friends were waiting nearby on the pier. As we walked closer to the pier she noticed a picnic table that had been set up with aesthetic fairy lights, pictures of us and a charcuterie board. On the board with the food was the ring box. It took her a second to realize it was there and when she did her jaw dropped and she goes ""oh my god is that?"" And before she could even finish her sentence I go ""surprise baby"" and grab the ring box, kneel on one knee, grab her hand and profess my love to her. I then ask her to make me the happiest woman on earth and marry me. And she said YES!! Then her family and friends included some friends she hadn't seen since before the pandemic ran over to the beach to celebrate with us! We spent another hour or so taking pictures, dancing to music with our friends and family, eating amazing food, getting a little wine drunk haha and just having an amazing time. We're back home now and I can't believe I get to spend the rest of my life with my best friend. I'm so lucky!

Hi y'all, it's your friendly neighborhood pineapple suppository enthusiast throwawaylurker012. I'll keep this short and I am typing this in a rush as I need to finish some work soon (fuuuuuuck) but got inspired by the ball thistles on Ryan Cohen and the almighty headband of DFV to push this out faster than a failed Rick of Spades bet.

While looking up some info for a recent post from u/expensive-two-8218 on GME's weird float numbers showing up the same nearly 2 years apart, I tried digging for any companies that were delisted that had weird float numbers. Nothing immediately came up: Blockbuster's historical float info was hard to find for this kinda thing, and Sears seemed to have offered no dividend **(but I did find that its spin off Land's End (ticker: LE) has had some crazy FTDs and may have had a low, slow squeeze from $5 into the $40s from late 2020 into mid-2021.)**

&amp;#x200B;

[C'est la...you can see a FTD spike as part of a long slow crawl up ](https://preview.redd.it/g6x23a03au991.png?width=2540&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=2ad7ae6b1910a452d191351dbe974bb4a6d19b0c)

Which doesn't mean anything, so I decided to look through some more familiar companies. I tried seeing whether Sears' old company SHOS (which was basically Sears' version of Buy Buy Baby if we think of Sears = BBBY in this metaphor) which I wrote about in ""Burn the furniture, kidnap the child"": [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t9vd1z/burn\_the\_furniture\_kidnap\_the\_child\_the\_story\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/t9vd1z/burn_the_furniture_kidnap_the_child_the_story_of/)

Turns out I thought why not look back into one of the company's I talked about there! Simply Mac.

I also talked about them in another DD that perhaps draws a bit more useful in this case, my ""Spectator Mode"" DD on delisting stocks: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sp5xwx/spectator\_mode\_zombie\_stock\_birthday\_songs\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/sp5xwx/spectator_mode_zombie_stock_birthday_songs_the/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Not for nothing (and apart from the lower than expected amount of eyes on it I got), of most the ideas in there I was mostly excited for the find that GME used to own that Apple repair/reseller business Simply Mac.**

**You can think of Simply Mac a lot like the SHOS example for Sears in the ""burn the furniture"" storyline above...one was considered the ""parent"", the other considered the ""baby"", but both companies traded on the stock market. Simply Mac was basically the ""baby"" to GME's ""parent company"" back in the day**.

[also wish this mockup I made got more eyes lol](https://preview.redd.it/yfuxwmulbu991.png?width=1676&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=a40e5eef3609eee7f34e2664269cf8b1852e3d2c)

&gt;Remember dear apes. The story of Sears and the rampant playbook of fuckery and crime used against it could have been the same for our dear GME...  
&gt;  
&gt;**In Feb. 2020, Moodys had downgraded GMEs debt, and Cool Holdings, which was buying GameStops Simply Mac business, had missed its first installment payment to GameStop. GME, on its own ropes and in need of help, demanded that Cool Holdings pay back the total of $8 million it owed to it immediately.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Despite being one of the largest Apple Premium partners back in the day, it also had a run of unfortunateness...**Cool Holdings got delisted itself just a few mere months prior, in Nov. 2019 by NASDAQ**. This helped lead to that Motley Fool article only a few months later worrying for GME. Later on, Cool Holdings changed its name to Simply, Inc. and nowno lietrades under the ticker SIMP. Its new gamer tag/CUSIP is 82901A105.)

So one of the largest Apple Premium partners was one that GME eventually asked for its money for as it was risking its own delisting death rattle in late 2019/early 2020. But even though Cool Holdings ran its own risk of having been delisted...**what ended up happening to Simply Mac (ticker: AWSM), GME's ""baby"" shorted after GME was on the ropes and needed cash now with no J.G. Wentworth in sight?**

&amp;#x200B;

[this happened](https://preview.redd.it/r1jn1g4icu991.png?width=1142&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=586e1ff35e77c8c66fad23cf6546787209bbdf6f)

&gt;""**As long as a CUSIP never changes, you can track how the FTDs keep going. And in the case of \[Simply Mac\], which had a float of about 56 million or so shares around the time of delisting, it had a single FTD spike of nearly 1.3 million just WEEKS before its first payment to GME was due\*\***. (For comparison, GME had a \~1.7 million FTD spike around the same time, with its biggest spike being 3.5 million but during the sneeze. 1.3 million FTDs for a float of 56 million is BIG.)

&amp;#x200B;

So AWSM/Simply Mac seemed to have been shorted into oblivion (potentially MORE than GME relative to GME's float) while GME was being shorted simultaneously, and delisted right before they could help give some money they owed back to GameStop.

Simply Mac got delisted after that and end of story.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Right? Well, of course, not entirely.

In Oct. 2020, Cool Holdings decided to try it one more time, and while in ownership of GME's old Apple repair/resale biz Simply Mac it decided to change its ticker to SIMP (OTCQB)**. Remember, SIMP was still Apple's LARGEST premier partner in the US, with 54 stores around the country at the time. But this was about a month on from when one of SIMP's biggest shareholders was taking a larger and larger hold of the company: SOL Global.**

&amp;#x200B;

[SOL SOL SOL SOL SOL SOL](https://preview.redd.it/8igm00zueu991.png?width=2128&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d2f9ab720fa35c25e1cef75893269c4ab73c77b2)

But if not for a MacRumors rabbit hole, I wouldn't have found why there was such a heavy investment from SOL Global.

**You see, GameStop acquired Simply Mac in 2013. And it bears witness to a level of fuckery that the ensuing fuckery on Simply Mac that we recently see through 2019 into 2022 (from its delisting and more)...began when the company was STILL a part of GME. And that fuckery in plain sight owes itself to the prolapsed anus that took over Simply Mac in 2016: Reiner Voigt.**

&amp;#x200B;

Voigt had been a part of the Simply Mac team since 2016 and seemingly GUTTED it once he took over (sound familiar?). He then proceeded to have himself and 2 others largely helm the way the company was run: Kevin Taylor and Andrew DeFrancesco.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kevin Taylor was the CEO of that private equity firm SOL Global, and Andrew DeFrancesco is the CEO of related SOL Verano Blocker 1 LLC. DeFrancesco was enough of a piece of--ahem--work to even sell other products from another company they owned in these stores: EV Toys**.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember all those SOL SOL SOL names popping up on Fintel? Well, let's see what ended up happening to this stellar SOL team that ended up overlooking Simply Mac's flaming crash into the ground and subsequent delisting?

https://preview.redd.it/0u5wkae1hu991.png?width=2000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=f11e1e19bbedc307d7b4c1aa161228d525c1d868

**They ended up having Simply Mac make convertible notes &amp; warrants to payout to YOU FUCKING GUESSED IT: SOL FUCKING GLOBAL. This allowed it to basically help it convert debt to cash equity that stuffed SOL's pockets.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now why does this matter? Because not only did Simply Mac get delisted back in the day and switched from AWSM to SIMP, **but it fucking got delisted AGAIN** and is now trading yet even ANOTHER fucking name in the OTCMarkets: SIMPQ.

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, it's so fucking bad other parts of reddit have talked about this:

&gt;I worked there for a year at the Lawrence, KS location, we were a store that opened in 2020. Worked as an operations manager, and I could tell you first hand it wasn't the fault of the pandemic. Inventory was not distributed to the correct stores, and investment in EV products are what destroyed Simply Mac. The managers have worked, including myself, 35-85 hours and will **NOT be getting paid for their labor**.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**\[Voigt, Taylor, DeFrancesco\] are thieves, liars, and scum. They have jeopardized the lives of over 350 employees, and have displaced 99% of them within 6 months. They funneled the remaining funds into their subsidiary companies SOL Global and SOL Verano--all of 2021--squeezing Simply Mac dry before filing Bankruptcy.** A month ago they told us we were restructuring, and without warning we were all terminated and will not be paid for a months worth of labor. We have to file claims with the bankruptcy court which could take months.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Our store was filled with thousands of dollars in inventory, but was never purchased and was never allocated to stores that sold those products.** Ex, We had over 60 adapters worth 50$, but only sold 2 a month. Hundreds of cases that were never bought.. EV products were eventually allocated after months of them not being sold.

The anger is fucking palpable. To literally perhaps due this not once, but fucking twice while lining their fucking pockets. **It was perhaps shocking to me to hear that the fuckers that ran them into the ground were fucking AROUND when GME was getting shorted during Jim Bell era (old GME CFO).**

&amp;#x200B;

But there's more to this story.

&amp;#x200B;

SOL Global is a name that frankly I never fucking heard of. But they are also major shareholders in something that many of you may have heard of about at some time. Especially if you were a kid in the states growing up in the Pacific Northwest (top left corner of the country for non-Ameriapes!)

[Jones fucking Soda](https://preview.redd.it/dz2uo1asiu991.png?width=2830&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=574cd8818302cf7cf9a2b0706df81e5421a212b1)

If you've never heard of Jones Soda, just know they were BIG. And big enough that they had some major names as part of their distribution.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On March 17, 2004, a deal was announced to distribute Jones Soda in over 3900 Starbucks locations in the United States, though Starbucks does not distribute in the United States as of 2021. On October 12, 2004, Jones Soda introduced 12oz cans for the first time with an exclusive distribution deal with Target, though other stores (including some Kmart, Food Pyramid, and Albertsons locations) now also sell the cans. Jones Soda was also sold at Ruby Tuesday.  
&gt;  
&gt;In June 2010, the company announced a distribution deal with Walmart and $10 million in financing from Glengrove Small Cap Value Ltd.

I mean this company was HUGE...at its height in 2007 when its stock prices was in the $30s it had actually JUST dethroned Coca Cola as the official drink of the NFL team the Seattle Seahawks. FUCKING. COCA. COLA.

If you're curious why you don't hear about this company perhaps AS much, especially when it traded on the stock market (ticker: JSDA), it might be due to what happened a few years after these distribution deals went through:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[roll that fucking not so beautiful FTD footage](https://preview.redd.it/tui6nsjsju991.png?width=2530&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=003f19195e375dc71b9f81529c014bf4d4091e5d)

**Near the height of its ATH at $32, a wave of nonstop FTDs seemed to attack the stock until it finally delisted in 2012**. And now I'm not saying that this was the ONLY reason for this to have led to the failing company (its NFL deal, an Alaska Airlines deal were called into question, the 2008/09 recession, as well distribution problems with its cans on store shelves) but it does back the question of being SUPER SUS that the FTDs both (in spectacular fashion) preceded and followed its ATH.

Nonetheless, it eventually delisted from Nasdaq back then, because its stock price hovered under $1 for too long. I talked about this issue in my Spectator Mode"" DD as well:

**Different rules apply as to why a stock might be delisted across different exchanges but here are the main ones most of us know:**

&gt;**Dont stay under $1 for a long time**  
&gt;  
&gt;**File regularly**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Keep a solid market cap**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Surprisingly, one late 2000s study found of all the reasons, listing at under the $1 requirement was #1 cause for delisting for Nasdaq, #2 for NYSE. Hm&**

&amp;#x200B;

Seems to have checked out for Jones. Who has since been delisted and still selling products.

**Our favorite fuckers at SOL currently went from owning 12% of the company some months back to now nearly 19% of that company now too**. All this growing interest in Jones while the company was seeking to be sold to Simply Better, a Canadian food and beverage giant, that had actually fallen through its last attempt at a sale:

&amp;#x200B;

SOL Global, who has a penchant for being fucking utter distended taints to the companies that are either delisted or heading there, is probably rubbing its greedy little hands over this.

And although this may or may not be part of the deal, there is one thing that stand to me about Jones Soda, and perhaps why it's valuable for ANYONE to own such a large part of it.

&amp;#x200B;

Jones Soda owns some sexy FUCKING patents:

&gt;[**Method and apparatus for creating and ordering customized branded merchandise over a computer network**](https://patents.justia.com/patent/6845365)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Patent number:** 6845365  
&gt;  
&gt;**Abstract:** The present invention provides a method and apparatus for creating and ordering customized branded merchandise over a computer network. A Internet site is provided that allows a consumer to create and order customized branded merchandise, such as bottles of soda. A customer may visit the WWW site utilizing a standard WWW browser executing on a computer. Once the customer has registered with the WWW site, the customer may place an order for an item of customized branded merchandise. The customer may also be asked to identify a graphic image for customizing the requested merchandise. The graphic image may be a digital photograph taken by the customer or other type of graphic image. Once the customer has identified a graphic image, the graphic image may be displayed for editing. The customer may be permitted to crop the graphic image or perform other types of image manipulations. A preview of the cropped or manipulated image may also be provided for the customer.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Type:** Grant**Filed:** December 6, 2002**Date of Patent:** January 18, 2005**Assignee:** Jones Soda Co.**Inventors:** Ernest J. A. von Rosen, Vaclav Vincalek

&amp;#x200B;

[technically they own THREE patents](https://preview.redd.it/polfrddbru991.png?width=1396&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=98a9108107f55292cc0f135c6336083c721bc0c8)

Ok, that's a shit ton of text. Can someone ELI5 this shit?

&gt;\[Jones Soda features a ton of customization.\] **Customers can also submit fortunes (similar to a fortune cookie) to be printed underneath the bottle cap**. The website sometimes asks for specific themes for photo uploads like the Patriot Photos or the Landmark Contest in order to create a special collection of labels.  
&gt;  
&gt;**In 1999, Jones began selling Jonas through a new section of their website,in order to meet the growing demand of people wanting to circumvent the photo selection process. myJones is a customizable 12-pack of bottles with which anyone can have their picture and message. The creation process involves uploading a picture (with optional photo credit of up to 50 characters) and providing customization (up to 7 lines of 50 characters). The fortunes under the caps are not customizable.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Above the picture on the label, the word ""my"" is added before ""Jones Soda Co."" to indicate it was customized and not bought at retail.

So Jones Soda, being ferried off to other global giants after being FTD' into the ground, and being under the growing thumb of noted GME adjacent fucksticks SOL Global, just also HAPPENS to own a patent which can let people like YOU literally upload your own pics and messages to the bottles you buy?

&amp;#x200B;

[If there ever was a power to the creators moment, this might be one?](https://preview.redd.it/m6lit5rsmu991.png?width=1680&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=c741597e1c6734e0ca3bf1d2c8fdb49036083229)

**Jones Soda not only has this patent but has even defended it in court in the past, including in 2010. Its images were used in another patent fight between a small TX company called Quark Images LLC and Adidas. Jones had been worried that Quark was unfairly using its patent.**

This last part about Jones and its patent perhaps matters the most regarding yet another meme stock in the basket: KOSS.

&amp;#x200B;

u/Sixstringsuperfly let me know of perhaps one of the BIGGEST finds about his KOSS research: that KOSS owns a MAJOR fucking patent on wireless headphones...and Apple is fighting them over it:

&gt;A**s you may have heard, Koss recently had some positive news regarding their lawsuit with Apple, who wanted to challenge Koss' patents for wireless headphones.**  
&gt;  
&gt;I wanted to take some time to emphasize and explore the ramifications of this lawsuit a bit further. Apple (who makes bluetooth airpods and also owns Beats headphones) is trying to challenge the Koss patents. **The Patent Trial and Appeal Board has recently decided not to review the patents, essentially ruling in favor of Koss.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ttclaw5vqu991.png?width=2110&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=12c3871b4f3aa5dc58af18354a8a53527a19101e

&gt;**So while this is HUGE in itself, there is a BIGGER play here: THIS SETS A LEGAL PRECEDENT for Koss to enforce and capitalize on its patents in the ENTIRE WIRELESS AUDIO SPACE.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Koss is THE pioneer of wireless headphones (and many other headphone innovations). It seems to have started around 1989 with the JCK/300 infrared wireless headphones, and then in 2014 with the BT540i, the first Bluetooth headphones.  
&gt;  
&gt;**So now, with this legal precedent, ANYONE selling wireless headphones is in violation of Koss' patents. This includes products from: Apple, Beats, Sony, Samsung, Sennheiser, Google, Bose, Amazon, Cambridge Audio, OnePlus, Skullcandy, etc**  
&gt;  
&gt;**ALL OF THESE COMPANIES NOW OWE KOSS MONEY**

When I saw what had happened to Jones, it immediately reminded me of KOSS and SixStringSuperfly's find.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*\* 

**It reminded me again of how even shit like patents fly in the face of the shorting that we see, and how a company like SOL seems to have hands in mirrored images to what we see, in its handling of convertible debt with a GME-adjacent company, as its hand in a shorted/delisted stock with an appetizing patent for a larger buyout client. Especially regarding that convertible debt, it sounds nearly IDENTICAL to the debt that GME was loaded up with pre-sneeze...and why it was so important for RC and the board to help pay it off.**

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I have no clear way to end this, and no actual conclusion, I hope you apes can dig further into any points here of interest, or any points that matter.

And turbofuck these SHFs and private equity twatwarbles with the biggest banana Rick can find.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

* **In 2013, GME acquired the premier Apple reseller/repair company Simply Mac (ticker: AWSM). In 2016, Reiner Voigt and other fuckers from private equity firm SOL Global watched as Simply Mac got delisted while they ran it into the ground.**
* **Voigt and his other SOL friends managed to relist Simply Mac under a new ticker (SIMP). They then created convertible debt/warrants that converted debt to equity...for SOL Global itself. It then got delisted AGAIN just a few days ago, and even posts around Reddit have referenced the company closing.**
* **SOL Global also owns a major stakes in Jones Soda. The 2000s soda darling Jones Soda had a major amount of FTDs near its ATH and was eventually delisted.**
* **Jones Soda is being shopped to other beverage giants for a buyout. Perhaps the biggest part of the sale MAY be its patents: Jones Soda owns special patents that allow people/users to customize their soda branding/packaging. This brings to mind** u/SixStringsuperfly\*\*'s find that fellow meme stock KOSS is also in a patent fight with Apple over its patent on wireless headphones.\*\*

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/10jrwyi/parents_told_my_brother_that_he_could_take_my/) *posted on January 23, 2023*

**Parents told my brother that he could take my house, and I could just live in the camper in the back yard because I'm single and he has a wife and kids**

I'll warn everyone here that this is going to be VERY long. So long that I'm splitting it into two posts and including a TLDR for each. I also really don't care who believes this. It's just so crazy that I don't blame anyone who calls BS. I won't argue about it. But this happened to me. I also really don't care if anyone in my family sees this. I'm not gonna sugarcoat anything. But I'm also not going to reveal any details that'd clue anyone in to who I am that doesn't already know me.

I'm a single man in my early 30s. I've got a brother who's 29, and he's already got four kids now. He had his first at 22, and the second followed a year later. Then the third two years after that. And the fourth is the most recently born a couple months ago. His wife (My SIL) and I do not get along as she always likes to try and get a rise out of me by acting superior. Then turns into an extreme self-victimizing drama queen if I retaliated against her in any way. She can cry in an instant and can put on an extremely convincing show to get sympathy from just about anyone. My parents and brother absolutely adore her, even though they know exactly how she really is and just don't care. She's very good looking, I'll give her that. But she's so awful that I could never be attracted to her. She also refuses to get any sort of job, even though she has a college degree and my mother willingly helps with the kids all day. So their finances are entirely dependent on my brother. This also means they can't afford to live anywhere but my parents' house. And privacy is a bit of an issue with all of them under one roof in a three bedroom house that was built in the 60s.

Growing up my younger brother was also the obvious favorite. We're three years apart in age, but he developed a superiority complex because I was badly punished if I retaliated against his antics in any way back then. It was obvious my parents cared for him a lot more because he got the lion's share of everything unless people called them out on it. Which did happen a fair bit by other members of family. Which is why my parents packed us all up and moved us about a hundred and fifty miles away from them, so they generally only would only see us on holidays since it was a three hour drive. My brother got physically abusive towards me on a number of occasions, flirted relentlessly with my first girlfriend to the point she broke up with me, and laughed at any misfortune I had. And my parents just told me to suck it up whenever I was upset about it. I only got equal treatment when my parents wanted to keep up appearances. I admit it was rather funny to see the looks on their faces whenever they had to treat me equal to my brother on birthdays and Christmas because other people were present. We had relatives that were very nosy, and loved gossiping drama. So my parents did their best to hide what was really going on, and threatened to take all my stuff away if I didn't keep my mouth shut. If anything, it just made my parents celebrate more when I turned 18 and moved out because it meant they no longer had to provide for me. I wasn't even done with high-school yet when I moved out. But couch surfing was far better than living with them. I was low contact ever since leaving home. They didn't even show up for my high school graduation. But I really didn't care. From that point on I would usually only see my parents and brother on holidays like the rest of the family.

The start 2020 pandemic was not kind to me. I lost my job, and couldn't renew the lease on my the condo because my roommate also lost his job and neither of I us could afford the place on unemployment money. It was a rented two bedroom condo that I really loved. As the lease was ending, my roommate left early to move back in with relatives, and I had to sell nearly all of my stuff because I was soon going to be homeless if I didn't downsize to an extreme. I really shouldn't have rented a place that was so expensive. But I liked living the high life. Until that life wasn't kind to me. And I realized I should have been living somewhere far cheaper so I could have saved more money to fall back on. But I had a plan. I own a truck simply for the fact that I've always loved trucks, so I found a $1000 camper in good shape and put it on my truck just so I could live out of it for a while. It was supposed to be temporary, But I ended up living out of it far longer than I ever thought. I originally was hoping to be able to live out of the camper at my parents' house, where my brother and his family  still reside as well. But when I asked my parents to let me stay for a while, they told me they had a full house, and didn't want me there. Plus, we hadn't exactly gotten along in the past decade. They said they'd only agree to let me park my camper there if I paid them basically what it'd cost to rent an apartment in my area. That was way too much just to park my camper. I was jobless and trying to save as much of my unemployment money as I could till I could find a new job. I may as well be living in an apartment with that rent price they were asking. My parents called my camper an eyesore and told me to take a hike since we couldn't come to an agreement. And SIL thought it was absolutely hilarious I had to live in a camper. My brother joined her in pointing at and mocking me while calling me a homeless bum.

I parked my truck/camper in a store parking lot to sleep on the first night that I had nowhere else to go. I felt scared out of my mind that someone might try to break in. Suffice to say I didn't sleep well that night. There was nowhere else I could go as any other relatives that owned houses were fairly far away, and all my friends were all apartment people. And I was pretty attached to my area as well. So I didn't want to just leave. I'd also had my mail forwarded to a friend's apartment. It was the only way I could still get my mail anymore.

Finding a stable place to park was pretty difficult. I went looking around to try and find a job similar to my old one. It took months of living the nomadic camper life. In that time, I had to deal with a lot. Everything from beggars and drug addicts, to people demanding I leave because my camper was an eyesore. At one point someone who told me to move claimed to be with an HOA. I wasn't even parked on a street with houses. And when I questioned ""**What HOA?**"" they got incredibly belligerent and threatened me. I moved my camper anyway just to avoid the trouble. In order to have a steady supply of electricity I learned to use a long extension cord to plug in anywhere I could to recharge my camper batteries. This meant sneaking around and plugging it into an outside outlet of a random building while parked on a street. I know that's a crumby thing to do. But I had to keep my batteries charged so my refrigerator would stay cold. I had a small solar power bank for recharging my phone. But I didn't have anything like a generator. And generators are noisy and require fuel anyway. So I did what I had to do. After months of living like that, I finally managed to get a new job. I had to move to the neighboring city to find a job that didn't involve retail. I worked retail while in college and promised myself never again. Though I was nearly ready to break that promise. I was still getting unemployment money. But I had no stable place to live while receiving it. And I didn't want to still be jobless when it ran out. Plus I was bored out of my mind. I had little else to do but read, watch movies on a small portable DVD player, use my phone or laptop, and keep note of where I could park and what local public bathrooms I could use. I kind of envy that the Japanese have public bath houses. We could really use stuff like that over here.

When I finally landed a new job, I practically lived in the back lot of the building by the warehouse in old employee parking spaces literally no one else seemed to bother using because they were so far in the back that the area was borderline forgotten. My boss/company owner actually liked this arrangement because I was willingly available to take any shift I could get, so long as I had enough sleep. He even let me take the camper off my truck and set it up in one of the spaces so I could drive around without it. Not exactly sure if this was legal, but no one bothered us about it. The entire time I lived back there, I didn't have to deal with many trespassers. There were a few, but the security guards escorted them out. I was pretty much on call almost all the time when they needed me, and was working virtually every day of the week. My boss let me plug my camper into the building for power and water, and I paid a small amount of rent by working for free on Sundays when no one else was in the office but the janitor and security guard. Beyond that I usually had to shower at a friend's apartment, or at my local gym as the camper didn't have a shower in it, and only a portable toilet. And I didn't want to fill it because emptying it is a nasty chore. So I used other bathrooms as often as I could. I had a key to the warehouse, and could go in to use the bathroom there at any hour. I was even on a first name basis with the night security guard. He's since become one of my closest friends. The camper was easy to heat in the winter with a small electric heater. Summers were not fun though. The camper didn't have AC, so I had to get a used portable air conditioner just to make it bearable.

I made a lot of overtime pay, and hands on learned some new skills from other employees. Eventually mid-way into this year I landed a better position in the company as a supervisor, and started making a better salary than my old job. That's when I decided I wanted a house. The scare I'd gotten from losing my condo made me realize I needed something much more stable for the long term. I looked around for something close to my work, and just two miles away found a three bedroom manufactured home on a small property. But I managed to get it for $10K less than the asking price somehow. I used nearly my entire savings for a down payment and got approved for a home loan. I finally didn't have to live in a camper anymore. There was enough space for me to back my truck in behind the house to take the camper off to set it up in the back yard. So I put it there as it's own little building just in case I want to use it again.

When I was fully settled in the house, I was dumb enough to brag about it on my book of faces. My family saw the post, and that's where this shit really starts. After a few weeks my parents and brother along with his family came to visit completely unannounced to have a tour of my home. I didn't even give them my address. So how they found out where I live, I still don't know. None of my friends have fessed up, and no prior family members visited me before that. So I wonder if they stalked me at work and followed me home or something. It really wouldn't surprise me. Once I opened the door, they practically all shoved their way in like rambunctious tourists. Then just started making themselves at home. They all kept poking around and SIL had this creepy smirk that she was repeatedly flashing me. And it was only later that I figured out why. And it made me madder than a bull on steroids that just got stung by a hornet. My parents were constantly talking about how I've got so much extra space now. And it's too much for someone like me who has no wife or kids. (Sure, not now. But maybe someday) And my brother kept remarking about how there was more space than our parents' house, and my house was closer to his job too. Red flags all around, I know.

Eventually my brother asked me to speak privately. Everyone else suddenly left the room and piled out onto the front porch. That's what finally made me realize they'd planned something. My brother (Let's call him Dan for the sake of simplicity) said the house was too much for me alone. And I should let him move in with his family because his wife is pregnant with kid number four. And my house is much closer to his job. He pointed out that I already have the camper, so I could just live in that outside while they live in the main house. And I'd like to point out that Dan never once spoke of offering rent. Mind you he's got a good job. He also started talking about how there would be changes, and even curfews. And that I couldn't just walk in at any time without prior notice. If it weren't my brother, I'd think the person I was talking to had lost their mind. But Dan lost his marbles long ago thanks to our parents treating him like he was the center of the world. I tried to speak, but he kept talking over me as if I had no say in the matter. There was no way in hell I'd rent my house or parts of my house to him. Other people maybe, just so I can pay the mortgage off more easily. But certainly not him, or his nasty wife.

I've heard of this exact kind of situation in videos online many times. And never once did I think I'd actually live it because I thought it so ludicrous. But my parents, brother and SIL do all fit the bill for a bunch of narcissistic entitled crazies. So I picked up my phone and set it to start recording. Then just held onto it. Dan didn't even seem to care or notice that I'd done this, and just sat there with his arms waving around while talking about all the reasons of why he needed my house. Then went from saying that to acting like it was a done deal and trying to reach out his hand to shake mine. That's when I finally showed my backbone and said ""**HELL NO!**"". And I said it loud enough that Dan stumbled backward for a second. I'd rarely ever raised my voice to him on that level because I was punished by our parents whenever I did. But this was my house, not theirs. My spine can be as shiny as it wants here. I stood up and then told him that my house was not up for grabs. And acting like I'll let him move in just because they want it, won't make it happen. I bought my house for me, and it's not my fault he keeps having more kids and has to keep living with our parents because he can't afford to move out. Dan got as physically close to me as he could without actually touching me and said that I didn't deserve the house, and he needed a better place for his family to live. I laughed back in his face and said that was total bullshit because I worked hard to be able to buy my house. Of course I deserved it. Dan started yelling that I have no wife or kids, and I don't need all the space. So I may as well **give** it to him. I said I'm not giving him anything. And he never even offered to pay me rent. If I let him move in, I'd still be covering the entire mortgage on my own house without even being able to live in my own house. Then Dan told me that he shouldn't have to pay rent because his family comes first, and our parents said I was going to do this, and that I will! I yelled ""**As if their word was law or something!**"" And told Dan that they did not have the right or power to give my house to him. Then right one cue my parents and SIL barged back in through the front door and surrounded me to try and force me to agree.

There was a lot of fighting. But to sum it up from this point on I heard the line ""**Just do it for Dan**"" way more times than I can remember. In the fight I told them all they don't have a say in my life or my house. And to get out before I called the cops. SIL screamed the loudest at me about how she was pregnant again, and I can't do this to her. I said I did nothing to her, she just assumed she could take and take from me like I would just allow it. I had no obligation to her or her family. Then I called her a stuck-up bitch who never had any respect for me. So I don't care what she thinks or how many kids she has. I have no sympathy for her. She won't be living in my house! Well that made her angry enough to attack me. She got in one good hit on my face and tried to do more, but my brother held her back kicking and screaming. She kept demanding he let her go so she could scratch my eyes out. The phone I was holding recorded pretty much everything. So I held it up and said I was going to call police if they didn't leave right away. My parents told Dan they were leaving. Then my mother said that I had a week to come to my senses. I told her I won't be, and to not come back. Then I told SIL that my phone recorded everything, and if she tries anything, I'll press charges for assault. She screamed at me and then stormed out loudly crying with her face in her hands. My mother was the last one out the door and said that I better do this for Dan and SIL. I responded by telling her I won't be.

TLDR: Family raised my younger brother as the golden child, so I made my own way in life. Then I lost everything and they wouldn't help me when I needed them the most. I ended up living in a camper for years until I got back on my feet and bought a house after some hardcore saving. Now my parents want my house because they want my brother and his family to be able to live there, and make me live in the camper in the back yard. Brother acted like it was a done deal because our parents said so. I kicked them all out.

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/10l9iq8/part_2_of_parents_trying_to_take_my_house_for_my/) *posted on January 25, 2023*

**Part 2 of parents trying to take my house for my brother. They broke my locks to move in while I wasn't home**

As I stated in the first half of my post, many will find this unbelievable and long. Yes I am aware there are similar sounding posts online already. I've seen a number of them now. But it's not like those posters have a monopoly on this sort of shit happening to them. If anything, I'm surprised this site hasn't been better weaponized against this sort of thing since entitled people should be more afraid of getting outed here. But anyway, I do not blame anyone who calls bullshit. I would too if I was reading this. However by reading this and my first post, you'll know just how messed up my parents are, as in my life they were the root of all evil that spoiled my brother into the asshole he is today. And never once have they given me a real reason for why. And I kinda fear there isn't one. Some people can't explain why they make choices like child favoritism. So it's all they can do to try and stand by the child they backed. Which is exactly what my parents tried to do. And I've practically destroyed their lives for it. Not in the legal sense, but more an emotional one.

After I kicked my parents, brother and SIL out for trying to force me to hand over my new house to my brother, I immediately went to my social media and told the story to the whole family. It spread pretty fast, but you won't find it now because it all got deleted some time ago and I put my own profile on private. I posted about it because I knew that the first thing my family would do when they got home is try to twist the event to make me the villain. And I was exactly right. But I had about an hour to get started before them. And I had video evidence to back up my story about what they'd done. ***(No I don't plan on showing the video here. So don't ask)*** Being preemptive worked because I got a fair number of family members on my side right away. My parents, brother and SIL must have been all set to write their own post, but it was too late. So they didn't even bother trying to lie much. My parents, Dan and SIL had a few flying monkeys supporting them. But not much else. Plenty of others knew how entitled they already were. So what happened was something they all quickly understood and accepted. There was one person in particular that called me. I don't know who they were. But they ranted at me that I was a horrible brother, and I needed to make way for a real family man. I just ended the call and blocked the number. This didn't repeat.

The week went by, and my parents showed up with Dan at my front porch just like they said they would in their prior ultimatum. They rang my doorbell like crazy and also pounded on the door until I finally answered. I opened it just a crack, and they tried to shove their way in again. But I'd installed a couple of latch chains that prevented it, and even braced my body against the door for good measure. My father and brother demanded I let them in. But I said I was recording everything on camera, and would call the police if they tried to force their way in again. My mother calmed them down, and then in her most sickly sweet tone asked me if I was ready to let my brother move in. I told her and the rest of them to fuck off and never come back. My mother put on the crocodile tears and asked me why I can't just do this for Dan because he's my beloved brother. I laughed and then bluntly said I do not love him as a brother because he treated me like shit for years, and they only encouraged him to do so. They are terrible parents, and he is a terrible brother. Then told them to leave or I'd be calling police ASAP.  They all left surprisingly easily, apart from my mother's loud crying and the others giving me dirty looks. One could say making them leave was suspiciously easy. I thought the whole mess was over. But I guess I should have taken them more seriously, because they had other stupid plans.

I came home later that week on Friday evening to find a moving truck and my brother's minivan parked in my driveway. It was Dan and his family there moving stuff in. He just waved to me with a shit eating grin when I saw him. I was furious and told him and the rest of his family to stop. But SIL smugly said to me that like it or not, they were moving in. And then in the most fake way while tilting her head and puckering her lips, she said that it was ok, because my mommy allowed it. And I should always listen to what my mommy tells me. I seethed with rage just hearing those words and looking at her smug bitchy face. So locked myself in my truck to call the cops right away. When they realized what I was doing, SIL started pounding on my window and yelling at me to stop. And that I can't do this to her because she and Dan need the house. And she cried ""**Why can't you just do this for Dan!?**"" I responded with ""**Fuck Dan! It's my damn house! Not his!**"". Then she threatened to key the side of my truck unless I stopped calling the police. All of which the 911 operator heard thanks to the window being slightly open. I told SIL if she damaged my truck, I'd sue her. And she was smart enough to retreat.

When the police arrived, Dan and SIL along with their kids had locked themselves in my house. I told cops what had happened, as well as showing them my new driver's license that had my current address on it. Then when we went to my front door, I saw that they'd changed the lock. And the old lock was laying on the porch with the center of it drilled out, and the drill they used was laying right next to it, with a complete Harbor Freight drill bit set. (Could they have been any more stupid leaving evidence out like that?!) I pointed out the broken lock and drill, then gave the police a rundown on all the events that happened prior.

Well I guess Dan called our parents over at some point after I arrived home. Because they showed up while I was talking to the cops. My parents immediately lied and started saying that I'd agreed to rent my house to my brother and his family. I said that was an easily provable lie one way or another. So Dan and SIL finally came out of my house with some papers in hand. They both looked super smug, like they'd somehow outsmarted me. They'd actually drawn up and printed out a fake rental agreement. But my signature was not on it. There was one, but it looked nothing like my handwriting. I don't think any of them have ever actually seen my signature. So that was incredibly stupid on their part. I told my parents and Dan that was stupidly blatant fraud. And if the cops investigated, they'd easily figure that out. And I don't think going to jail and court would do them any good. It could even make Dan lose his job. Which is his only means of providing for his family. I also said I would get a lawyer and sue for damages if anything of mine was lost, stolen or broken. And I'd call CPS too for good measure. Dan went white and looked really scared when I said all that, but my mother got between us and doubled down about how I should just do this for Dan, and live in the damn camper so they can finally have a family home to themselves. I yelled at her that if she thought it was such a good idea, she could do it for Dan herself and let Dan have her house to himself instead.

The cops separated my mother from me and I said I wanted them all out right now, or I'll press charges. I stated in a shout about how they'd drilled out my front door lock to break in, the lease papers were obvious fakes, they badly forged my signature, and I have recorded video of SIL attacking me. Those are felonies I could fuck over their lives with if I wanted. And if they didn't leave, that's exactly what I'd do. The only reason I hadn't already was for the sake of Dan's kids. So they have one chance to get the fuck out! The moment my parents heard that, I think it finally clicked that they could not force me to do it for Dan. My mother surrendered and said she'd put an end to this. Then she went over to SIL and spoke with her quietly for a minute while my father spoke to Dan. SIL instantly started loudly crying and ripping up the fake rental papers into tiny bits and tossing them like confetti, only to have an officer tell them to pick up the bits of paper or he'd cite them for littering. Both of the cops at this point had the ""**I don't get paid enough for this!**"" looks on their faces.

Dan had to start telling his kids to load their stuff back into the moving truck. The kids were all crying, and the eldest was sobbing that he won't get his own room now. SIL and Dan gathered their kids up to try and make one last pathetic attempt to guilt me with the sad family routine. (You know, where they all gather together in a sort of group hug while all facing one direction) I swear, I think they'd practiced it beforehand. All of the kids had the same pleading look with quivering mouths, SIL kept rubbing her pregnant belly and tilting her head to look like a sad puppy, and my brother just made the saddest face he possibly could and said ""**Please don't do this! We need to be able to live here!**"" But I didn't falter and told them to keep packing. All the kids and SIL turned the crying up to 11, and Dan yelled at me ""**Are you satisfied with yourself?! You've denied us a home because you're too selfish to share and help out family!**"" I ended up laughing like a maniac and retorting that what he was trying to do was taking, not sharing. And no amount of crying will make me let his family move in because he's no brother of mine anymore. He's just an entitled prick who thinks he can take whatever he wants from me like when we were kids. Dan started F-bombing me until the cops told him to cool it or he'd be in cuffs regardless if I wanted to press charges. He sucked in his lips and looked a mix of afraid and supremely pissed off.

I asked the cops if they could stick around until my parents, brother and SIL had all left. And they said they had no intention of going anywhere until this had been resolved. In fact, in the next few minutes two cops became four as more drove in for whatever reason. That gave my parents some extra incentive to get moving. I made Dan give me the keys to the new lock he'd put on my front door. (Though I got another lock the next day anyway because I didn't know if he had copies of the keys or not) He was really reluctant to hand them over. Then instead of handing them to me, he actually threw them down the street and into a storm drain while saying to go get them myself. But one of the cops scolded him for that and made him go get them. He had to pull the grate off just to get at them. And he got pretty dirty in the process. When he got the keys back, he just grumbled then slammed them down into my hand. I then told them all to leave and never come back. My mother said I'd be disowned for this, as if that were some kind of threat to me. And I voiced that to them. Then in an overly sarcastically I said something along the lines of ""**Oh no! That means I won't get to come to any holidays with you guys where I always get treated like shit by you all anyway! Because Dan has always been your obvious favorite! You treated all me so badly when I was growing up that if Dan ever needs an organ donor, I wouldn't give him anything! So do like you always told me to do when I was mistreated by all of you, and suck it up!**""

My parents were floored after I said all of that. And the quartet of cops were looking pretty judgmental at them as well. I tell you, if you want to put nasty parents like mine on the spot, confront them in front of cops. Because they'll likely not try anything really stupid then. My mother just started crying and walking away. My father just stood there looking like he wanted to hit me. And Dan just held his kids in defeat. Oh and SIL was off having a tantrum in my front lawn. Soon enough they all formed a line handing out boxes and got their stuff out of my house. Nothing had been unpacked yet. So it all was taken out pretty quickly. But while doing it, my mother kept saying it wasn't too late, and I could still do it for Dan several times. Each time trying to bargain more and more to try to make me change my mind. She said that Dan could pay me rent if I let them stay. And when that didn't work, she said I could move back in with them to let Dan rent my house so I wouldn't have to share the building. I told her to shut up and keep packing boxes because I don't want Dan or his family around, I don't want his money, and I certainly don't want to live with him or my parents ever again after the way they treated me when I was a kid. Making a deal with my parents would be like making a deal with the devil to me. SIL ended up having another tantrum after hearing that and threw a box down, then sat on the ground to have a pity party because she didn't want to go back to sharing a house with my parents. And she just sat looking angry/sad there until everyone else was finished. She didn't even want to get up when it was time to leave.

They finally got everything out of the house and into the truck. So before they left, I laid into my parents one last time about all of the shit they put me through growing up. And with four cops being right there, they couldn't do much other than stand there and take it for once. I called them out on so many things that happened. And even pointed out how they couldn't just do something nice for me. Like letting me stay over with my camper when I was homeless and trying to get back on my feet. How they let Dan and SIL ridicule me and call me a bum. Well who's the bum now! They wanted to kick me out of my own house so Dan could stay in it free of charge, yet when I needed a place to go, they wanted to gouge me for more than I could afford just to park my camper when they knew I was out of the job. There were more extremely judgmental stares from the cops when I said all of that. So I put my parents on the spot one more time and asked them what I ever did other than being born to deserve being treated so badly. Because when I finally have a bit of success in life, they want to snatch it away from me for their favorite child since they'd rather I give everything to Dan, and have nothing for myself. I bought my house using the money that I earned. I owed them nothing, and I won't be asking anything from them ever again. Because clearly I will never be anything more than a doormat or a cash-cow in their eyes.

I got no answers from them. They just stood there looking like fish out of water. So I continued ranting and asked them what in God's name made them think they were such good parents after all of that? My father was beet red. But more from embarrassment than anger this time. And my mother was crying that she was a horrible person. I bluntly agreed that she is a horrible person. They all are! And I bet they'll go to hell for it too! They were shitty people, and they all knew it. But if I'd called them out on all this stuff in private instead of in public, they'd just get mad at me and still act like I'm in the wrong. They'd just kept up the denial for so long that it became a part of who they are. My mother buried her face in my father's jacket to cry. And my father looked more defeated than I've ever seen him. Dan and his family avoided me entirely as they finished putting everything back in the moving truck. I made sure nothing of mine was stolen. Not that I'd had a chance to get much furniture yet. (I was lucky to even have a couch at that time) They all got back in their vehicles, and SIL just stood staring at me with malice until my brother finally got her to drive the minivan home. And as soon as they were all gone, I got back online again and spilled the beans what happened. My parents were too embarrassed to even try and defend their actions this time. And while the family was somewhat split before this incident, it was now a landslide in my favor. Nearly all of the family has sided with me after this incident. And those who haven't simply aren't siding with anybody. No matter how much my parents previously tried the ""**We did it for Dan**"" line, no one listened anymore. So any remaining familial support they had is now gone. Many in the family who I expected wouldn't side with me, did. That includes the former flying monkeys. So I guess they've finally had enough. Around that time I offered to host half the family at next Christmas Eve in my new house. My parents were not invited.

I wasn't blocked on my brother and SIL's profiles surprisingly. And I saw SIL had her fourth baby in early November. They are still living with my parents. I'm pretty sure they knew I was watching, because SIL kept making passive aggressive posts every couple of weeks or so about not having enough space while living with my parents. Probably to see if she can still guilt me. And I'm sure it's driving my mother and father up the wall because they aren't getting any peace and quiet in their old age with three rowdy obnoxious kids, a mentally unstable SIL, my golden child brother, and a newborn baby in the house all at once. Perhaps they could move into a camper in their own back yard and let Dan take over their house completely. They might get some peace then. Yeah, they could do that for Dan.

There was supposed to be more. But this post got way too long. So I'll be posting a part 3 later.

TLDR: I had to live in a camper after losing my job in 2020, parents refused to help me, I got a better job and eventually bought a house, parents found out about the house and tried to make me let my brother and his wife who was pregnant with baby number four move in and kick me out to live in the camper again. I kicked them out, but later on they tried to move in anyway by breaking in. Police were called, they freaked out and tried to guilt me, I made them leave. I publicly exposed my parents, and now the entire rest of the family is on my side, and my parents are utterly destroyed about it.

Date: March 21, 2022

I \[29F\] started seeing a guy \[34M\] early 2019, everything was going well and we were seeing each other fairly regularly until about 10 months in when he confessed he ""technically"" had a girlfriend \[27F\] who he had been living with for a few years. He explained to me that they were pretty much broken up and it was more of a roommates situation until their lease ran out then he was going to leave her properly and get out. He kept telling me how she was mentally abusive to him and super codependent and he was miserable and felt trapped, he was just waiting out the lease on their apartment. I was angry that he hadn't told me earlier but I understood why it was something awkward to bring up and explained to him that I wasn't comfortable with the situation but we had a great relationship and a deep connection and if he was serious about leaving her we could figure something out. He told me that she was very aware he was leaving her and she didn't care about who he was seeing or anything like that, and if I'm being honest I was so infatuated with this man I felt no reason to question it, I just believed him.

So we continued our relationship and the date the lease ran out got closer and closer and he was making zero effort to move out. He would mention it occasionally but with no real plan of action so I started getting suspicious. He told me she was being manipulative and saying that if he moved out her life would be ruined and she wouldn't be able to afford her bills and may hurt herself, he said that although he didn't want to be around her he didn't want to add any more stress or pain to her life and he felt he had a duty of care to her so they ended up renewing their lease.

So given that I don't want to be labelled as a homewrecker, I meet up with him and explain how he's made me feel completely used and like he doesn't care about me or our relationship (unsurprising all things considered) and he basically responded by love bombing me. He was telling me I was his soulmate and that one day he was going to marry me he just doesn't have the heart to hurt her and cause her more stress but he would get out when she was more stable and we would be together and a load of other complete crap. As previously stated, up to this point I was under the impression that she knew he was seeing someone and was planning on leaving her, I then found out from a mutual friend that was a total lie. She still thought he was her boyfriend and even though their relationship was rocky, she had no idea he was planning on leaving and even less idea he was seeing anyone else. I was absolutely furious when I heard this, like properly hit the roof and cut everything off entirely, I told him I knew he had been lying to both of us and not to contact me again. I stopped responding to his messages, I thought this would be the end of it and I started moving on with my life.

Fast forward to about 3 months ago, I walk into a cafe and there he is, sitting alone in a corner, I get my coffee and sit down far away from him. Clearly I didn't sit far enough away because he walks over and asks if he can sit down, I say yes and we have a bit of a catch-up chat, he apologises for everything that happened and throws in a bit of guilt tripping and a ""woe is me"" story of how bad their relationship was but I hear him out mainly just for my own closures sake. So I get home and do a bit of snooping on Facebook, I see they're still together, still living together, and she's pregnant. By this point I'm just relieved I dodged a bullet and I'm not a part of their toxic situation anymore.

So then last week he messages me, he tells me he's not stopped thinking about me since he saw me, letting me go was the biggest mistake of his life, and he wants me back. He starts going on about how seeing me brought back all the memories and reminded him of how happy we were. He also tells me he still believes we are soulmates. He finishes his over dramatic wall of text by saying he has finally got his life sorted out and is single, he then asks me if I would be willing to give him another chance. I dont mention that I've seen they're still together or any of that stuff, I just reply saying it was good to see him but I've moved on.

Now here's the bit I really want advice on. I've been thinking about this for a few days now and I just don't know if I should tell her. I have no idea how much of this woman's mental state he was being honest about or if she really was mentally abusing him but I know from mutual friends that she would probably react very badly (and probably violently) if she knew what he had done. Part of me wants to just draw a line under it and do nothing but I keep thinking if I was pregnant and had been living with a man for like 5 years, I would want to know if he was trying to start an affair and calling some other woman his soulmate.

Should I tell her? If I do tell her is there a way of breaking it to her softly? I just really need some advice on how I approach this.

Side note: I also realise I really should have told her after they renewed the lease on their apartment but given what he was saying about her mental state and threatening to hurt herself I didn't want to exacerbate anything, I just wanted to move on.

TL;DR ridiculously toxic ex who lied about his relationship status walks back into my life after nearly 2 years of silence and wants to start a relationship again, fails to mention he still has a girlfriend (again), she's pregnant, do I tell her?

[\[UPDATE\] My ex wants me back, should I tell his pregnant girlfriend?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/twdh71/update_my_ex_wants_me_back_should_i_tell_his/)

Date:  April 5, 2022

I posted a few weeks ago about how my manipulative, gaslighting, waste of oxygen ex \[34M\] was trying to get me \[29F\] back even though his girlfriend \[27F\] is currently pregnant. I just wanted to give you all an update of what happened next.

My original post didn't get many replies but I want to just thank those who did reply as it really gave me some things to think about and some great ideas of how to approach the situation, so thank you all!

I ended up sending him a message letting him know that I knew they had never broken up as he said they had, I told him that I knew she was pregnant and I wasn't afraid to tell her what he was doing. He tried to deny everything and said that I must be mistaken and they had definitely broken up and she was not pregnant and if she was somehow pregnant it was nothing to do with him. I'm not an idiot and I'm sick of him thinking he can continue to get away with blatant lies so I sent him screenshots of the announcement from her public Facebook posts with him tagged. I basically told him that I wanted the full truth from him and asked him what made him think he was going to get away with manipulating and lying to two women who are both honestly worth better than him (I don't know his girlfriend, we have a couple of mutual friends but I do know that everyone is worth more than a man who thinks his behaviour is acceptable).

He got a bit defensive but finally told me that he didn't love her and didn't want to be with her and that the pregnancy had just happened and she was so happy he didn't want to ruin her joy by leaving her. He told me that he really had meant everything he had ever said to me and that one day he thought we could work it out and be together. I told him I'd been done with him for a long time and wanted nothing to do with him going forward, he seemed upset and slightly shocked at this revelation (which honestly shouldn't have been that much of a shock to him as I had previously told him on multiple occasions that I was done).

I told him that I have chatlogs of all our previous conversations going back 3-4 years or however long it's been now since he came into my life. I said I have all the conversations where he had told me he was leaving her, the conversations where he had lied and said she knew he was seeing someone, all the chats where he had tried to manipulate me into staying with him, messages where he had told me he loved me and couldn't stand her and couldn't wait for their tenancy to run out so he could leave, and even him trying to reach out a few weeks ago and me saying I had moved on. I made him aware I had all of it and would be forwarding it to her because she has a right to know what sort of man she is having a child with. He practically begged me not to and told me she wasn't mentally stable enough to deal with this right now (again with him blaming her mental stability when things aren't going his way lol). In the end he blocked me on WhatsApp so I decided to leave it and didn't message her, I assumed (wrongly) he would just take this as a warning and do better.

And then she messaged me on Facebook...

She sent me a message accusing me of trying to ruin her relationship and start an affair with her ""best friend and soulmate"". I don't know exactly what he had said to her about me but I didn't want to be painted as the bad guy in this so I decided to just go nuclear and sent her literally everything and an apology to go with it, I told her that I had been seeing him before the pandemic and was under the impression they were separated and she knew everything. I also deleted his number from my phone so in the screenshots I sent it showed his phone number so she would clearly know it was him who had sent the messages and he wouldn't be able to easily gaslight her into believing he was innocent. I calmly advised her to read everything then she could make her own choices. I blocked her and him on Facebook and blocked him on WhatsApp too, and deactivated my Facebook account just in case anyone else tried to involve themselves.

So that's it. I have no idea what the fallout has been, I'm keeping my account deactivated for a good few weeks and I want nothing further to do with this. Fingers crossed for her and the baby she will realise he is pathetic and leave him to be miserable and lonely. I had wanted to do this is a way that would cause her as little stress as possible what with her being pregnant, but either way what's done is done and she knows everything now.

TL;dr tried to message my ex and get him to stop lying to his girlfriend, he blocked me, she messaged me accusing me of being the one to start an affair so I sent here everything and then took myself off social media until everything blows over.","BestofRedditorUpdates",2685,2685,0,0.97,0,0,0,161

[Entitled Cousin and her upcoming wedding with Entitled Groom](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/gzms1a/entitled_cousin_and_her_upcoming_wedding_with/) 2 years ago 

Ohhhh man, I am so glad to have found this subreddit. I can't wait to share this (ongoing) saga. 

A little background info: I am an early-30's cis female, engaged to an early-30's cis male. We've been together for about four years; I was married once before to an abusive partner, and met my fiance a few years after escaping that situation and taking some years off to date around, go to therapy, and just generally put myself back together. I didn't think I'd even get married again, so I can say with confidence: my partner is the shit. We are both professionals, both own our own homes and buy our own shit, and are generally living a happy life in an amazing American city. More importantly, we are still desperately in love and have fun together every day. So what I'm saying is--I'm the happiest I've ever been (and, with the exception of the part coming up about my aunt and grandma, find this series of events all horribly amusing). 

My cousin is a 21 year old cis-female. She has dated and broken up with a series of guys roughly her age as one should when they're 21. I never think too much about it, and maybe should have (but didn't) pay attention when she kept talking about moving in with and marrying each and every one...I had friends like that at 21, and probably also tried to envision this scenario with everyone I dated at 21, because it's a part of getting older and planning your life. HOWEVER...then my cousin met Dipshit (obviously not his real name, except in our home where it very much is the only name we call him). 

I thought I didn't like him because I selfishly had other plans for my cousin; I was going to rent her a spot in my condo for way less than rent in our city, to move to our city (approximately 1.5 hours away) and get a better job in her nursing-adjecent tech field. Right now, she lives with her parents in a rural area and works two part-time jobs for a lot less money; there are so many huge hospitals here where she could have a well-paid career, and I had an easy avenue to help her get started in a new city. I have had a lot of great female mentors in my life, and I try to be one now to young women I love, as well. However, every time she'd get close to making this move (which she originally had approached me about, and ALWAYS CLAIMED TO WANT TO DO...but, in retrospect, always after a breakup--so maybe she was just in vulnerable ""I want something better than this"" places each time, which is understandable), she'd start dating some new guy. Whatever, you can do what you want...but I wanted her out of that tiny little town with no prospects and into a career...which, again, in retrospect, isn't fair of me because her life is her own and yada yada. This time was no different: enter Dipshit. 

Dipshit and she went for it FAST. They met and started dating in September. My fiance-then boyfriend-was hinting around at proposing around that time, and now suddenly cousin and Dipshit were, also (according to my aunt). I thought it was just more young, stupid love. Dipshit didn't even work; no way he was buying a ring. Well. Dipshit already HAD a ring; he had been engaged to another girl the year before, having proposed at Christmas, and that broke up around July/August...then he met my cousin a month later. (Dipshit is also 21, if that helps you visualize). I'm sure you can imagine what happens next: Dipshit proposed at Christmas, after a whirlwind romance of approximately three months. At that moment, my fiance and I became enemy #1 to Dipshit, as did all of my married siblings and cousins having babies, because no one else's relationship could possibly be the center of attention. Dipshit quits his part-time job to work a worse part-time job; states his intentions to not work at all and sell shit on Ebay once he's on Cousin's health insurance (he has diabetes, and is currently on his parents' but they make him work ""at least a"" part-time job in exchange. Dipshit has problems with being lazy; his illness doesn't debiliate him as is often the case with people. He is not on any kind of disability, nor does he need those resources to my knowledge). 

My fiance proposed on March 1, after I had just spent a weekend singing in the orchestra pit of the biggest theatre in our city, which was already a thrilling weekend; I literally walked out of the Stage Door after the last matinee, and hopped in the car to go to (what I was told was) a late anniversary dinner, since we had been so busy all winter and hadn't celebrated our three year. He also worked with my best friend to get about 20 of our friends there, and made the proposal an immedate engagement party. It was magical. ANYWAY, Dipshit and Cousin immediately cancelled plans to come to a big family dinner that month for Easter (moot point, since quarantine happened like two weeks later). My aunt (her mom) wanted a photo of my ring since I didn't post it on social media; I texted her one. I assume she sent it to my cousin, because I literally got deleted on every social media platform that night by my cousin. Weird...but whatever. 

My aunt is then enlisted to ask questions about our wedding planning. I like talking to my aunt about it, but soon realize that it's causing problems. My aunt and uncle \*took a mortgage out on their paid-off house\* to pay for Dipshit and Co.'s wedding (scheduled for this fall) which is getting crazier and crazier as it goes. I stop talking to my aunt in specifics about mine, and just turn the conversation back to Cousin each time it comes up; I'm worried my wedding planning is influencing their wedding planning, trying to have ""the best"" wedding. (Our wedding is almost a full year after theirs). Cousin has already lost her shit once because I'm using one of her colors as a part of my color scheme, also...I told her if that mattered, I technically used the color first in my wedding like seven years ago and laugh at my joke because the concept of someone owning a color is absurd. I get an angry facebook message from Dipshit telling me I deserved to have been abused by my ex (apparently cousin told him) and it wouldn't have happened if I had been a better wife and ""loved him harder."" 

Dipshit sends similar angry messages to other family members; my Brother and I laugh a lot because Dipshit tells him that no one can understand the kind of love Dipshit and Co. have, and that Brother clearly hasn't experienced that kind of deep love before. Brother has been married for nine years and has two amazing children. 

Other Cousin and Wife have their first child; Dipshit and Co. call the baby ugly, and talk about how their kids won't be ugly. Dipshit and Co. start talking about getting pregnant before the wedding. 

Cousin's Brother buys a house, and Dipshit decides he will live there rent-free and be the roommate. Cousin decided to move in, too--her brother is rightfully against that and tells them his house is not their love nest, and there are rules. They don't like that; now both of them are living with my aunt and uncle. 

Dipshit and Co. adopt a puppy. My aunt takes care of the puppy. 

Dipshit kicked Cousin's three year old niece out of the flowergirl role in their upcoming wedding, and calls that three year old a ""bitch."" 

Cousin tries to get a home loan and buy a house and can't get approved because she's 21, has no credit, and works two part-time jobs. She screams and rages at my aunt for days, and my aunt ends up back in the hospital having suffered a heart attack a couple of months prior. Aunt ends up needing some more work done to her heart, I'm sure completely unrelated to the stress of Dipshit and Co. 

Cousin's dad gets furloughed at work for a few weeks, due to quarantine. Dipshit and Co. tell him/my aunt they aren't losing a cent of their wedding budget. 

Cousin goes to my grandma and asks her to sign paperwork so Grandma's house can be signed over to her, and offers to pay $30,000 for it in monthly installments. My grandma has no concept of modern money; Grandpa did everything and died a few years ago. We've always stepped in when she needed a new car, home repairs done, etc., so she doesn't get swindled. She thinks $30,000 is low but probably not THAT low, as she thinks the housing market still exists circa 1975. Cousin is the youngest and the only one that hasn't bought a house, so she thinks it'll probably be ok and that money can get split between her two daughters and Brother+me (our mom died when we were teenagers, so we split her third two ways in the estate. Doesn't even matter because my Grandpa had Alzheimer's and was in a nursing home for a couple of years, so the state will get most of it anyway--we just want Grandma to have a happy life). Other Aunt begs her not to sign anything yet, and gets the house appraised. Grandma's house is worth $120,000. Dipshit and Co are angry, because they wanted to buy the house and sell it out from under Grandma and keep that profit, and someone found them out. We decide we won't accept a penny under $120,000 from Dipshit and Co., and Grandma is mad at them. She also begins calling \[real name\] Dipshit. 

[Dipshit and Co. update](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/ien4a1/dipshit_and_co_update/) 1 year ago 

Hey! Its been a while, Im sorry. I havent seen much of the part of my family Dipshit and Co. are a part of, with COVID-19 and keeping my distance per government mandates and common sense, but I DO have a few updates. 

-Cousin got hired full time at the place she was working part time, and bought a house! Good for her, very proud, etc. It was an inexpensive fixer-upper down the road from her parents, but considering shes only 22 its still cool. Dipshit isnt on the mortgage and I suggested to her she never put him on, but...she seems pretty confident this LoVe WiLl LaSt FoReVeR. 

-Uncle is increasingly more pissed at Dipshit because uncle is always over working on the house for them, and Dipshit is helping, but he doesnt do the jobs correctly so uncle is doing twice the work. 

-Dipshit and Co keep their puppy caged all day, and just got a second one for some reason. 

-Dipshit quit his job to work on the house. 

-Cousins wedding shower happened and it was discovered through one of the games that they dont know that much about one another. 

-Aunt told me at the shower that Dipshit told Cousin he wants her to be pregnant AT the wedding, and have a baby right away. Apparently he thinks thats the most romantic thing ever/now shes stuck with him forever. 

-Dipshit and Co. sent out wedding invitations and are still planning to proceed with their indoor fall wedding with 200+ guests, despite an international pandemic. Aunt told me that anyone who declines to come will just really prove they dont love Cousin. 

-My fiancé and I are going to stand or sit in the back of the ceremony and opt out of the reception. My grandma is coming with us, because this is also what she wants to do. 

[Dipshit &amp; Co update Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/u01kw2/dipshit_co_update_part_1/) 3 months ago 

1. Dipshit and Co.s wedding did happen, right at the point that our states COVID rate was ramping up before the 2020 holidaysand she was, indeed, pregnant at it. Only about 1/4-1/3 of their guest list attended so we stayed at the reception since we had a table to ourselves (masks on) for a little while (honestly, it was really hard not to since we hadnt seen family in such a long time). No one except our table wore masks, of course. It felt like a high school prom and we didnt stay long. There were little beads on the table to write marriage advice on, to put in some kind of jar after the wedding. Other Aunt wrote Post-Nuptial Agreement on one and dropped it on a random table to be collected. 

2. Baby was born and is a cutie. I helped Other Aunt host a small baby shower (important later). 

3. Dipshit has quit approximately six-ish jobs in the past 1.5 years. Currently he and cousin both work part time. Aunt is unhappy because when he is home he doesnt pay attention to the kid and plays video games all day. I just heard recently he has quit this job too, but I dont know. 

4. We postponed our wedding a bit, scaled down, swapped it to be outdoors, and made it vaccine-dependent to attend. We luckily got it in when things were at an all-time low, and feel really fortunate. It was a beautiful day, and after six years we are married! No one from their family came because they refused to get vaccinated. Cousin added me back to social media around that time and then deleted me after she saw pics. She and Dipshit like to make fun of our wedding and call it The Royal Wedding, I assume because it didnt look or feel like a high school prom. 

5. Husband and I are pregnant and have not announced it to the family yet. Grandma asked us not to because shes afraid Dipshit and Co. will get jealous that theres a new baby and have a second one that they, by all accounts (though I dont personally know this for myself) shouldnt. I didnt realize people competed for youngest baby? But maybe you all have stories. 

6. Cousin and Aunt did not attend my bridal shower, despite me assisting in throwing and paying hundreds of dollars for her baby shower months prior. Grandma says she will force them to my baby shower; I told her I was fine with them just not coming. My MIL has been regaled with many a tale of this family and she desperately wants to see them in-person. Shes hoping Grandma is good on her word. I&just really hope they cant make it. 

Those are all the major updates. We have a family dinner planned next month and my belly is not hide-able so I promise Ill give a more timely update. I laid low for a bit because a commenter was getting a bit harass-y and I didnt feel like dealing with it beyond reporting it. Hoping theyve moved on by this point. 

[Dipshit and Co. Update 2!](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/wh2avg/dipshit_and_co_update_2/) 12 hours ago 

I cant believe I already have an update! Going to keep it relatively brief, because the entitlement is relatively obvious in this one. 

Grandmother has long complained that Cousin and her siblings get pregnant when anyone else in the family is (I think I mentioned this in my last update). Its not entirely wrong, as she and her siblings children make up half of the total amount of great-grandkids and are all within a year of everyone elses kids. Well, guess what happened at my baby shower a few weeks ago? Cousin announces shes six weeks pregnant. Point, Grandma! 

Now, most people tend to wait a bit longer than this to announce. We didnt tell immediate family until about 12 weeks, and didnt make a real announcement until we were almost into the third trimester. We also arent 22 years old. I sincerely hope everything goes ok for her, because I know how much I held my breath at that early stage. 

Back to funnier things: my aunts threw me an amazing shower, and pulled out all the stops. Cousin has already told Aunt she wants a baby shower just like it. Aunt told her you only get one shower and we threw the shower you wanted already for Baby #1, so tough luck. Didnt go over well. Cousin feels if Baby #2 is a different gender than Baby #1, she needs another shower/gifts. Aunt told her thats your problem not buying / asking for gender neutral colors and caring about something so trite in the first place. 

Dipshit is currently only seasonally employed, and on (we think?) his third job since getting married almost two years ago. All insurance, etc. comes from Cousin, who also has just told Grandma she plans to quit her job and stay at home when the second baby comes. This has Grandma very upset and worried, because she doesnt feel like they pay a lot of attention to their one year old, now. I guess theyre also potty training the one year old, and have the baby in pull-ups 24/7. Baby is legitimately 13 months old...a true one year old. 

Anyway, thats the scoop. We are super excited about our own adventure into parenting, and Im just praying C&amp;Ds kids make it out ok, and dont turn into spoiled brats like their parents. 

OP Note: I'm marking this as ongoing as OOP and cousin are pregnant and OOP is still actively updating cousin's entitlement.

#MASSACHUSETTS

**Barnstable County (Cape Cod) Sheriff:** Democratic nominee Donna Buckley won the race with 52% of the vote, defeating Republican Timothy Whelan. Buckley ran on pulling the county out of the previous sheriffs agreement to cooperate with Immigration and Custom Enforcements (ICE) [287(g) program](https://www.aclu.org/report/license-abuse-how-ices-287g-program-empowers-racist-sheriffs).

""That is priority number one."" Also key to Buckleys campaign were increasing rehabilitation programs in county jails and ending contracts with private medical vendors.

&gt;An investigation alleged deputies were four to 10 times more likely to stop Latinos than non-Latino drivers.

We have twins (1.5M&amp;F). 

Josh's family and I don't have a close relationship for some reasons, their racist, homophobic and xenophobic comments make them people I don't keep close contact with. Josh is a ball out of turn. 

All of his family trips it's always pretty clear that they didn't invite me and Josh always says it's their family thing so they feel uncomfortable with me (to be quite honest I felt ree from that) so I never went in the past. 

But with the arrival of the twins and a pandemic, the trips didn't happen.

About 3 months ago, Josh said there would be a family trip to a city in another state (3h by plane). I was really excited as it would be the twins' first trip. He said he would organize everything. 

3 weeks ago, (travel would be in 12 days), I started packing the twins clothes and looking for clothes for myself. Josh saw me putting my clothes on and asked what I was doing. When I said I was packing my clothes for the trip, he said ""Baby, it's my family's trip, you know it's an intimate thing like my BIL and SIL. I just bought it for me and the twins"".

Keep in mind that none of his brothers have children, only girlfriends or fiancées. 

I said that and asked if he planned to take our children and not me and when he said yes, I just laughed and called him deluded, because I wouldn't let them go to another state without me and I wouldn't sign the authorization either (he asked me tô sign) (babies need authorization from both parents). 

We argued a lot and he got angry, saying I was depriving our children from his family. In short, he went alone. 

And after so much humiliation, I decided to go on a mini vacation in a country house 1h away by car. Josh and I didn't talk these days. 

He arrived yesterday and the house was empty, he called me asking where I was and I said I took a vacation. He had the nerve to ask if he could join, but I was sincere in saying that I wanted space (he knows where I am) and spend time alone w/ Kids.

He started to say how hypocritical I was to go on a trip with them and he couldn't, that I was being mean and vindictive. It's escalated to the point that even his family is calling me a hypocrite and cruel for not allowing a moment between them. 

I just wanted to have peace with my twins after going through such a humiliation and I'm thinking about leaving early (I would go on Sunday). 

AITA?

Btw, my twins are stll breasfeed. And he points out several times that I made the mistake of thoght that I waa going on the trip, he never said I would. That's a fact, but I thought at that time it wouldn't happen.

*Extra*: Well, in case you have any doubts, the biggest reason I didn't let the twins go, is in fact being another state thousands of km away from where I live. The city I'm in is a district of mine, 1h by car (even less). He wanted to go somewhere  that's 3 hours by plane and more than 1 day by car, if something happened I wouldn't be able to get there fast. If it was close to where they would go, it would be something else.","AmItheAsshole",2481,2481,0,0.96,0,0,1,360

Our company made a compromise to allow most employees to WFH twice a week but employees had to agree not to provide childcare when WFH. I didn't understand that until my coworkers with kids started slacking off and becoming unavailable during the day. 

Some of my coworkers would try to talk to me about their kids and how challenging and overwhelming it is. Then they'd start to ask me for favors. 

For example, my coworker needed to come to a last minute office meeting that I scheduled. He was supposed to be in the office anyways and not WFH that day. He threw a fit that he and his wife didn't have a nanny that afternoon so he asked if I could take his place in the meeting.

I said absolutely not. I have my own work to do. If he can't come in, then let the receptionist know so she can notify the office and turn in a PTO form to HR. He said that his kid wasn't feeling well and he was still working but just couldn't come in.

I told him he just did not want to let people know he was babysitting while WFH and now he's asking me to cover for him lol. He went on about how hard it is with a baby and his wife works crazy hours, etc.

I told him that I couldn't care less about his kid. This is work not family. If he can't come in, then email our boss that he's too busy with his kid to come to an important meeting and I'll reschedule if instructed. But I'm not coming to the office or using my office time so my coworker can stay home and save babysitter money.

TLDR: Coworker agreed not to be providing childcare while WFH but did. I scheduled a meeting on a day he was supposed to come in the office but he said he didn't have childcare and asked me to take his place. I said no because I'm not staying late over his kid.

Edit: There is a HUGE difference in productivity with my coworkers who use their kids as excuses at work when they are in the office or WFH.

When they are in the office, they actually pick up their phone, respond to emails, check their messages, etc. 

When they're WFH, it's like they're on vacation.","AmItheAsshole",2476,2476,0,0.96,0,0,1,516

We have a 9yo together. During the divorce proceedings, he slept with Maggie and got her pregnant. I do not consider this cheating, I had started dating as well, but the timing is still awkward and a lot of people assume he had an affair and that's why we got divorced. I try to correct that impression for my daughter's benefit, but he did still leave me and I'm not his PR rep.

At first things were very amiable, they were no longer together but I developed a good relationship with Maggie and my daughter got to know her half-sister. We even let my ex take both girls at the same time. Then my ex started dating someone else and started missing visits and forgetting to call back, and generally falling short in terms of co-parenting.

Our house has this garage-turned-mother-in-law suite. When we first moved in we had a few renters, and then later we sporadically used it for AirBnB before the pandemic. Maggies rent was increased substantially and shed been having issues with her neighbors complaining about her having a crying baby, so I invited her to rent out the unit at a discount. Legally, shes a tenant like anyone else would be, I just lowered the rent a bit for her and put in a few extra clauses.

I notified my ex and he was pissed and said it was inappropriate and weird.

In theory it should be convenient to him because now his daughters are literally in the same place. And its a better environment for his youngest daughter too, she now has a better living situation with outdoor space and more resources (Maggie has a good job but shes just saving up for a down payment in a decent school district so is trying to keep rent and other expenses down for the first year or so).

Admittedly I initially thought it would be closer to a typical tenant relationship, obviously I hoped we'd get to know each other better, but for example when I invited her I went out of my way to say that she could do her own thing and have privacy as a tenant, she wasn't obligated to entertain my daughter in her house or let either of us in whenever we wanted, that kind of thing. And she seemed like she cared about that too and was going to be respectful of our house as well. But it turned into more of a cohabiting thing, like her coming over for dinner most nights and my daughter (very much voluntarily) spending time there during the day ""helping"" with her sister. We even share my daughter's babysitter now.

My ex was pissed when he found out and more pissed when he realized how it was going in practice, and said I crossed a line by inviting her in the first place, and it was messy. Our house was supposed to be our forever home and he did a lot of work on it and I think he thinks of it as sacred and part his in spirit even if legally it's mine. One of his siblings said that I was trying to ""throw it in his face"" which what am I even throwing in his face, it's not like he had an affair.","AmItheAsshole",2428,2428,0,0.98,4,0,1,291

we didnt talk much during the pandemic but we recently became friends again. one day he got drunk and told my wife what hed done. my wife pulled me aside and told me about it. its a very austin thing to do, hes a total ass and he kind of embraces it. im not going back to jail cause i have a kid now, and of course im not mad at my sister. apperantly she asked him to teach her the the basics bc she doesnt wanna embarrass herself when she has sex with someone she loves.

A few years ago my wife came to me and said, I want a few chickens she wanted to raise our own eggs. We lived in the city and my immediate reaction was not only no, but hell no. I had never lived in the country or even been hunting. Well it turns out city ordinances allow chickens but no roosters. Over the next few months she kept explaining why we should get some chickens. The word she used was nagging. Her word not mine. One morning I woke up and she must have had a pillow over my face while I slept; because, oxygen deprivation is the only thing I can think of that made me give in. 

So, we set off to the local farm supply store to get three, THREE, chicks a coop-in-a-box with attached run (more on that disaster later) and the other necessary equipment for the budding chicken rancher. We picked out what looked like a good coop-in-a-box, (some assembly required) bottles, feeder, feed, and a heat lamp. While I was looking at something, she picked the chicks. Notice I kept saying three. Oh wait, this was my first exposure to farm math, we got six chicks. My wife explained that one of them would probably end up being a rooster that would have to go and at least one or two would die. Yeah, I believed this. It sounded reasonable to a city boy. Hell, I didnt even know the difference between straw and hay. I wasnt even sure there was a difference.

So, we get home and she takes the six, not three, chicks into the house. I unload the coop-in-a-box and start to assemble this thing. The first thing I noticed is the material the coop-in-a-box was made of looked cheap, as in low quality, not inexpensive. The second thing I noticed was it was designed to sit on concrete or at least perfectly flat smooth ground. So, after it was assembled, I wasnt happy. It looked rickety and the joints didnt seem very tight, but it was up and ready. What I didnt know was the chicks werent ready for the coop. For the next six weeks give or take the chicks lived in a plastic tote improvised brooder in an unused bedroom. My Yellow Lab spent a lot of time at that door hoping for a miracle. No eggs yet; but, hey, its still early. During this time, I noticed that the hinges on the nesting box werent water resistant much less water tight. Every time it rained the nesting box flooded. After a little creative engineering that problem was fixed and time to get these chirpy nuggets out of the house. By the way, there were still six chicks, not three. They did quick work on the  grass in the run. It was turned to bare dirt in a matter of days. I quickly noticed that the latches for the coop and run doors were not very secure and replaced them with better hardware.  Still no eggs. Little freeloaders. 

About this time my wife started to talk about meat rabbits. I think she had taken to drugging me. Thats my story and Im sticking to it. I didnt even resist, well not too much. I think I was starting to like the idea of raising our own food. Dont tell her. I like letting her think she talked me into something I was willing to do anyway.  She found a used hutch set up on Craigs list and I mounted them under the back yard deck, after some modification and wire replacement. We got a buck and three does. 

At about this time, I started to feel the chickens didnt have enough room and cleaning the coop-in-a-box was very difficult. So, I built a 8x16 foot enclosed run to surround the coop-in-a-box. This also solved the problem of the coop-in-a-box door hinges starting to come loose. After I built the run, I could leave the coop-in-a-box open. It also made cleaning much easier because we didnt have to worry about escape attempts. The grass in the newly expanded run lasted about three weeks before it looked like the dirt in the coop-in-a-box run. Im sure everyone knows what happens when it rains on a chicken run. We had a mud pit. Back to the farm supply store for some metal roofing. Now the still six chickens had a roof over their run. 

Still not one egg; but, we had had our first litter of bunnies. So, I went to the kitchen grabbed a frying pan, walked out to the chickens, and showed the pan to the freeloading miniature raptors. I told them I was putting either eggs or them in this pan. Two days latter we got our first egg. Yeehaw, happy dance. My wife still thinks my threat had nothing to do with the beginnings of egg production. What does she know. We started getting one egg a day per bird shortly after that. 

Soon I was the primary egg dealer at work. I had no idea there was such a large market for fresh eggs. We also started to see rabbit as part of our diet. I started selling rabbit poop to a few people who had raised garden beds. Yes, I became a shit dealer. Who would have thunk it. I had no idea such a market even existed. But duuuuude I got really goooood shit. 

It was about this time I learned that chicken wire will not stop a Lab. He thought he was in squeaky toy nirvana. That incident got me down to four chickens. Yup, back to the farm supply store for supplies to reinforce the run with hardware cloth. Shortly after this my lab started hanging out at the door to that unused bedroom. After a few days I herd a bird like noise coming from the bedroom. I figured one of my kids had left a window open and I was hearing birds in a tree. Guess what, there were baby chicks in that make shift tote brooder. I didnt have four chickens, not even six. I now had a total of eight chickens. EIGHT IS NOT THREE not even if you use that new math theyre teaching!

Even before we married, the wife and I had been casually looking for a place with a few acres. Nothing really came of it and the idea kind of slid to the back of our minds. Then one day a friend of mine called to tell us about a piece of land that was on the market. 60 acres with four bedroom house, an attached two car garage, tractor shed, work shop and a small pond. Long story short, we ended up buying it. We still had our place in the city because it was 100 miles from the property to my job. We spent every weekend on the property. Then my mother who was living with us got to the point she needed a wheelchair. The house in the city was built in 1890 and not wheelchair friendly, not even a little. So my wife took my mother and moved to the property. Open floor plan, wheelchair ramps front and rear and one story. My brother had different days off then I did so we rotated down to the property to help take care of my mother and give my wife a break. 

Property like this does require maintenance. Three acres of grass to cut, eight acres to brush hog, trails to keep clear, a big garden and firewood to cut. And that requires equipment and time. 

Little did I know how things were moving along and I was being changed. Damn chickens. The first thing I did was build an eight by eight chicken coop that was eight feet tall. I could clean it without getting on my hands and knees. I did this on my own no prompting. It was built using the lessons of what not to do that I learned from the coop-in-a-box. Attached to that was a 20x40 run. Can you tell I think there should be a place in hell reserved for the people who make those coop-in-a-box contraptions? My city chickens became country chickens. Next was a better improved rabbit setup. We now have two hutches. One with four large cages and one with eight smaller cages. We still have the three does and one buck. But more room for grow out. I also built two chicken tractors. 

Somewhere along the line we decided to get Guinea Hens to help with the tick control. We let them free range 100% of the time. Those little beggars are loud and stupid.  Every predator thinks they are just scrumptious; but, they finally figured out how to survive; at least most of them did, about half at least. 

Then came the quail and an incubators. We are now hatching out chickens, quail, and Guinea Hens. I was surprised to see what you can get for bunnies, baby chicks and Guinea keets at an animal swap. Given how stupid Guinea Hens are and the resulting high mortality rate, they have turned out to be some of the most profitable critters we have. The only hard part is finding their nests so we can steal the eggs. 

I retired during Covid pandemic. We sold the house in the city and I moved to the farm full time. More time on my hands meant more time for animals. We only have about four acres of pasture. The rest is wooded with underbrush. You know who likes wooded land and brush? Goats, thats who. So after learning how to build a goat resistant fence and listening to goats for dummies, we have six dairy goats. My wife is the primary animal person in this arrangement. I do infrastructure, she knows animals. She actually had me listen to goats for dummies on a road trip. If you ever do listen to goats for dummies skip the parts on goat disease and illness. Those chapters makes them sound like plague animals that will explode if you look at them wrong, or just out of spite, Yeesh. 

One thing we do have is a coyote population. They were responsible for several of the Guinea losses. We dont want to be fattening up the local coyote population with expensive dairy goats; so, we got ourselves two Great Pyrenees as guardian dogs. Boy do they take their job seriously. Coyotes, opossum, raccoons and even hawks tend to stay away now. Theyre even willing to challenge a thunderstorm. We get our first bucks next month. Im taking a break from building their fence as I write this. 

So now Im maintaining 60 acres, helping with 6 goats, 30ish chickens, about 20 rabbits right now, 15 quail, only god knows how many Guinea Hens(counting them is like counting gold fish), building fences, animal shelters, training guard dogs, sending chickens, rabbits and quail to freezer camp, running a brush hog, chainsaw, wood splitter and spending my Saturdays at animal swaps instead of enjoying the big city life. I miss my Starbucks, ok not really. And it all started with my wife asking the innocent question. Can we have a few chickens for the eggs. Evil little gateway animals. 

This is all basically true and written with the intent to hopefully make someone smile or even laugh. All joking aside, I dont think I have ever been happier.

A little over two years ago we got CPS involved in his household with my brother and SIL (not his mother). My nephew has epilepsy and a speech issue. His mom died when he was a baby. My brother was in and out of relationships until he met SIL when my nephew was 6. She was a single mom of two kids and from the get go they made my nephew's life so much harder than it needed to be. His stepsiblings hated him and bullied him relentlessly. There were issues in and out of school and then when school went online during the worst of the pandemic it got so much worse. My brother and SIL really did nothing. They tried to put the stepsiblings in a caretaker position and to look out for my nephew in school and protect him from bullies or people who would try to steal his meds.

Many family members brought concerns to my brother but he really didn't care about the harm to my nephew. In the end it escalated to the point CPS felt like the safest option. They removed him from the home and placed him with my husband and I.

My brother has tried to get him back several times. My nephew doesn't want to go back. They took some steps the court set out for them but after interviews with my nephew agreed not to return him.

SIL is now trying to become more involved in nephew's life by reaching out to me. I know this is an attempt to help my brother regain custody. But she's so awful about it. She has called and texted me to pass messages onto nephew. Even saying that his brother and sister (her kids) miss him. The other day she sent an email since I blocked her phone number, saying he should be with his parents and siblings and how she should be told about medical appointments, etc. I responded that she had no business contacting me about my nephew and to leave me alone.

They lodged a complaint with the case worker that I was blocking contact with her, which was dismissed as being fine seeing as she's not the biological or legal parent, but family members are saying I was wrong because pissing them off could make my nephew's life more difficult.

We have outgrown our tiny apartment. We have a young child and want another, but we cannot afford a bigger place. We save and save but cannot catch up to the pace of house prices. My mother and her husband own three homes (soon to be four). While she heavily relied on her parents financially, she has not been there that way for me. Through pandemic unemployment, high medical bills for our premature baby, and numerous other unfortunate expenses, she never offered any help. 

Her and her husband, who considers himself my child's grandfather, own five cars, and periodically they abandon the cars at one of their vacation homes to ""look like someone is home all the time."" They planned on doing this with an additional car recently, one that was only a few years old. I expressed my hurt that they were planning to abandon yet another car while they knew we were struggling financially.

Housing costs have become such a struggle that a couple months ago, I applied for a job in a much cheaper state, 12 hours away. I told her about this, and although she is very close with her grandchild, she basically just said she'd visit a lot. It felt very much like ""don't let the door hit you on the way out."" Ultimately a relative (who only has one home) intervened and offered to help us in the event we could no longer afford rent after the upcoming increase (expected to be an increase of around 800/mo).

One month after I told her about applying for the job out of state, she told me that they got a beach place. I thought she meant a rental at first. It materialized that no, they purchased a home on the beach. She expected me to be thrilled. She even said they did it for us (me and my spouse and child). The price of the home is in the same price range of the sort of home we would like to buy--a 3/2--but that we have been priced out of over the last couple years. 

I was very hurt by this and felt like it was a slap in the face. Well before closing, I told her I would not be able to go to their new vacation home (they have two others) because it would be too upsetting for me. It is an extremely frivolous expense in my view, when they already own two vacation homes in the same state as the new one. I don't feel entitled to their money, but neither do I want a front row seat to them wasting it while we struggle.

For what it's worth, I would have zero problem if they used this money to pay off their existing mortgage or save for retirement or pretty much anything other than a third vacation home that is the cost of the home we are hoping to be able to buy. Like the abandoned car, it feels like money is just being thrown away. And I know they can do what they want with their money, but I don't want to be in that house knowing they preferred having it to helping me and their grandchild.

I don't understand how he is so well behaved considering he came from me. I live for this kid, one of the best feelings in the world was when he learned to hug me back. 

Before having my son my wife and I would play video games with our group of 6 friends. We'd play all day, I'd buy the server online or host it from my house and let people on and off as needed.

Now I don't have free time, and I don't miss having it. All my spare time is spent with my son or my wife. We constantly get told that ""our lifestyle"" is ruining their lifestyle. They joke about us giving our son away, or ignoring him, all kinds of abusive things that turn my stomach. They get mad that I don't offer to pay for servers, or leave a power hungry 1U server running all day. That shit cost money and that money could be spent on better things.

We quit drinking, partying, smoking because we felt like it was time to focus on other outlets and being responsible parents. We still try to set up games after 8pm until 11pm to keep in touch, but all we hear is how there isn't enough time for them to play and how its shit we don't smoke or invite them over, or how we ruined DnD night.

Last night one friend said they would drug my wife if they found out she was pregnant again. They said it as a joke, but who tf would even joke about that? My wife has already ""Denounced"" one of the friends and won't speak to him and the rest are really close too. 


Ok. Now I can breathe now that I lifted that rant.


Edit: this got more attention that anticipated. I'll clear a few things up.

I don't resent my friends or shame them for not wanting children. That's their choice and I fully understand why they don't want kids. Kids are hard and stressful and they don't want the extra baggage. We always joked about things, but never personal. They made it personal and that offended me.

Making new friends is hard, very hard if you don't have a lot of time to dedicate. With covid and a baby we also aren't as social as before the pandemic so that's not a train I want to hop into just yet. I imagine they will move on soon from us and become another happy birthday post on our Facebook.

To people saying I'm cynical or shaming people I'm not. If you want kids you do you, if you don't want kids you do you. Idgaf what people do, it's when you make it personal that crosses a line, it's when you threaten my wife as the brunt of a joke that crosses a line, a thing we never did prior to their resentment of my choice of starting a family.

Edit 2: I appreciate the advice and support and conversations from everyone. Ya'll could keep me occupied for hours. Last thing ill mention:
My wife and I still play video games every night, regardless of friends or not. If my friends dont support my lifestyle thats on them and its no skin off my bones. The only thing i've lost since having a child is an empty feeling. I feel so much more fulfilled since my son came and i cant fucking wait to show him video games. I think the first game i will show him is Mario Kart.","TrueOffMyChest",2199,2199,0,0.95,3,0,0,513

# 0. Preface

In 2009, the film industry and movie fans worldwide jizzed their collective pants over a new film that had come out. One which, in its wake, led to several sequels and billions of memes echoing every word and pregnant pause (slightly edited for the purposes of our story):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*If you let my \[child\] go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will \[end\] you.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Apes can be a very varied bunch, delving into everything from oil construction to retail to body language. And given all our own talents, we may, of course, be fans of film.

But we're not here as much as to talk about movies, as we are to talk about something that may be relevant to the past week: the story of a parent company and its ""child"".

# 1. Whats an Exit Strategy? Ask Eddie Lampert&

Back in 2014, former Goldman Sachs VP Robin Lewis pushed a particular idea on their blog: why shouldnt Amazon acquire Sears?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3xhjdloox8m81.png?width=1151&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=bbccbff91d25d64a83088fbeb12766aa537abbfd

**According to him, Jeff Get Big Fast Bezos would have acquired 2400 retail stores (or rather the buildings themselves) in an acquisition of those 1300 Sears &amp; 1100 Kmart storefronts.** These might have allowed for convenience for pickups &amp; returns, as well as match how Walmarts 2400 stores often doubled as distribution stores.

The commercial real estate gimme would have been huge for Amazon. And the sale would have been music to Eddie Lampert, whom had been drilling Sears straight into the fucking ground over the past few years and watched the market cap of the company diminish.

&amp;#x200B;

[not at fucking all](https://preview.redd.it/ybwc1rzpx8m81.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=b477545824e855a8d8e1da416afec09c633bb899)

**Bezos would have gotten cheap buildings without having to set up and construct new ones or sign expensive leases:**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**What Eddie gets in such a sale is a potentially profitable exit strategy that many analysts, myself included, believe he is pursuing.**  
&gt;  
&gt;In fact, in several of my past articles I have opined that Lampert was, indeed, managing the business into liquidation. And regarding the real estate assets, Lampert has been methodically selling, leasing (partial or in total), and/or closing Sears and Kmart locations. Indeed, he indicated not too long ago that Sears Holdings was considering shuttering its entire fleet of Kmart stores. **So if he is seeking an exit, a far less painful and certainly more profitable option would be a sale to Amazon.**

&amp;#x200B;

In the wake of that carrot-and-stick for Sears shameful captain, the meat and potatoes might have been a particular means to an end as well for that potential exit strategy in the form of one offshoot of Sears Holdings\*\*. That offshoot was known as SHOS.\*\*

# 2. The Story of SHOS

SHOS, or Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores, spun off from Sears back in 2012.

Now Sears was an absolutely huge retailer back in the day in the American landscape; **if you recall, one that was once worth nearly 1% of the entire American economy.**

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""locally owned and operated\\""...sigh.](https://preview.redd.it/1wbk4ihsx8m81.png?width=350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=53f6c69214a52e6385fb34c1caa7f3fd6188059d)

For its specificity, SHOS focused on home appliances, as well as outdoor equipment like hardware, lawn &amp; gardening tools. Unlike Sears, SHOS stores were much smaller and split into 2 parts: (1) Sears Hometown Stores &amp; (2) Sears Outlet Stores.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Sears Hometown franchises sat at about 8500 square feet vs. 140,000 square feet for larger stores. **They accounted for 70% of SHOS revenue, and usually serviced smaller markets that couldnt fit a giant Sears.**
2. Sears Outlet franchises accounted for 30% of SHOS revenue, and apparently had a nice handle-hold on the market according to one Seeking Alpha blogger:...the Outlet Stores have become the de facto clearinghouse for the entire U.S. appliance industry's bruised, damaged, returned, reconditioned, overstocked, and ""nearly new"" appliances, and are estimated to possess over 2/3 market share, domestically, of that business!

&amp;#x200B;

Eighty percent of the Outlet Stores overall sales consist of appliances, 75% of appliance sales represent ""as is"" appliances, and only 30% of total sales are sourced from Sears Holdings.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# 3. Burn the Furniture

Remember Goldmans Lewis? He floated one appeal to Bezos above all else in the appeal of Sears inventory: appliances.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**While Kenmore appliances, Craftsman tools, and DieHard batteries have been placed into another entity and charge Sears royalties as a licensee, Im sure Amazon would insist they come with the deal. And, those are iconic brands that can be re-energized.**  
&gt;  
&gt;The e-commerce business, which Lampert invested most heavily in and strategically focused on for future growth, while only accounting for about 3% of the total business, **could certainly be leveraged when plugged into Amazons model.**

&amp;#x200B;

**And Lewis was right. Even in our story of SHOS, one thing above anything else anchored its tale: its appliances inventory.**

&amp;#x200B;

[ A report on SHOS by a YT channel called Real Deep Value Investing. 41 views. Made me think of someone we all know obv ](https://preview.redd.it/wfo62v4vx8m81.png?width=953&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=5ce48c05d856ec5697b0d491be07b970bdf48572)

**In 2016 AND 2017, nearly 72-73% of its revenue distribution was JUST appliances! In fact, its improving outlook through that time let it ink direct deals with appliance bigs like Whirlpool, GE, Samsung, and Husqvarna.** It was also known for carrying its Sears name-brand Kenmore appliances (half of Sears total appliance sales in 2016).

&amp;#x200B;

**SHOS had big balls to swing around: by 2017, SHOS was the ONLY retailer to contain ALL of the top 10 major appliance brands under one roof.** Despite its store square footage, SHOS wasnt no small fry.

&amp;#x200B;

All of this news tons ofyesdeep value investors into a frenzy. At one point, the stock was trading at $2. **Investors flipped shit wondering why, when book value based on its appliances alone should have put the stock much higher: $9 was a common number offered, nearly 4x as much.**

&amp;#x200B;

[\\""burn the furniture...heat the house...\\""](https://preview.redd.it/hs5d9euxx8m81.png?width=965&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=886e0cccf1e81e2438c9dfb25924646bbb2844e5)

Another thing that made it a little bit different than the big Sears stores which anchored malls was its square footage\*\*: 80% of its stores were franchised or owner-owned (no different than a McDonalds for example).\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

SHOS supplies the goods to each franchisee, SHOS gets paid commission by the owner after a sale, andon the other handthe owner is on the hook for most of the real estate and operating risk. Not the parent company.

&amp;#x200B;

And while store closings were beginning to show up around 2016 &amp; 2017, many knew that its stock price should have been truly buoyed above all else by the absolute weight of its inventory:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...2/3 of net current assets or less being a measure of extraordinary ""deep value""). In the case of SHOS, with roughly $160 million in net current assets, **the company is selling at just over 25% of net current assets, an unheard of valuation that provides a truly astonishing margin of safety.**  
&gt;  
&gt;What is even more incredible is that the vast majority of those current assets ($355 million) are represented in inventories, and over 70% of those inventories are high dollar value appliances. Since the appliances are carried on the company's books at cost,  
&gt;  
&gt;**it would be likely, in any potential liquidation of the company, that SHOS would be able to realize proceeds of upwards of 90% of the carrying value of its inventory, as suggested by recent store closures&**

&amp;#x200B;

[IYKYK](https://preview.redd.it/yjtyde7zx8m81.png?width=1124&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=98f416f0a54c7092f048327efac9c93e9e77c546)

**Yes, you heard that right. If it literally burned the furniture and its stock down overnight, a liquidation would earn it essentially 90% of its worth.**

It was info like that which made deep value investors cream their corn.

Investors were more than willing to not just like, but support the stock. However, the parent company, did not share investors enthusiasm. At least in the ways that mattered.

# 4. I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing

SHOS found itself hamstrung by Eddie Lamperts Sears more than once through its dying days.

Most notably, despite Kenmores high sales in 2016, it wasnt getting much support from the parent company. **For one, Sears Holdings was NOT promoting its own brand of Kenmore appliances and NOT giving it any subsidy.**

&amp;#x200B;

[Is SHOS gonna have to choke a bitch?](https://preview.redd.it/9vwy86a0y8m81.png?width=485&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=dcc0ad33c8aac4243f7791a625e8fcca29ea83f2)

**As a result, this meant that SHOS stores had to LOWER prices for Sears-Kenmore brand shit across the board to compete.** This meant someone walking into a Sears Outlet store might see a new Samsung washer vs. a used Kenmore brand one. Usually, you might have even had people more willing to dig into a used/out-of-box or floor model appliance since Kenmore was roundly considered by many analysts to be the shit  (my words, not theirs).

&amp;#x200B;

**But despite Kenmore having BETTER sales and arguably better brand recognition at the time, it had to lower its prices sharply to compete without parent company help. This would all slowly eat into sales for the entire firm.**

&amp;#x200B;

In this case, its easy to argue that Eddie Lampert shot Kenmore sales in the dick by failing to push one of its biggest movers. **We also notice how little Lampert helped SHOS with what happened with Whirlpool, one of the biggest appliance suppliers to SHOS.**

&amp;#x200B;

[like fucking clockwork Eddie](https://preview.redd.it/k0zyl6j1y8m81.png?width=376&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4f1ce72373a1443ee7c0d39e8e200b37d7ee2e37)

**Whirlpool had actually had deals ongoing with Sears Holdings (think Sears parent company and the giant anchor stores). However, since it felt that just like Kenmore, Eddie Lampert was effectively shooting it in the dick, SHOS inked an INDEPENDENT supply arrangement with Whirlpool:**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**This is a testament to the financial strength of the SHOS balance sheet, and another reminder to skeptics that Sears Hometown and Sears Holdings may have similar sounding names, but they are NOT the same company.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Now this is frankly fucking insane, that Whirlpool told the parent company to fuck off and asked instead to deal with the smaller but baller pal instead.**

&amp;#x200B;

[from the article \\""Who Dumped Who? Sears or Whirlpool?\\""](https://preview.redd.it/hzjm65w2y8m81.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=ee133a90aec475e7da907674989f989fb8c29da6)

**But these deals might have meant gold to their bottom line: SHOS 2016 10-K said that operating independently of SHLD might have meant lower costs as they now sourced those products independently. (Remember, this is what helped make it the only retailer to own the top 10 of all appliances under its own roof, even more than its own parent company**!) It even received a $40 million loan (facility) from Gordon Brothers to help support this move for these independent deals with Whirlpool and others.

&amp;#x200B;

And this was apart from its continued pushes to innovate itself, like lease-to-own moves for appliances (think Rent-A-Center), leveraging a direct purchase agreement with Ashley Furniture and noticing a sizeable increase in sales once it started rebranding certain stores as Americas Appliance Experts. **It wasnt just pissing in the wind, SHOS noticed its appliances, brand name and quality MATTERED.**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

# 5. Alexa, say Go Fuck Yourself SHOS

Sears Kenmore branddespite its being hamstrung under the SHOS umbrellahad exclusivity in who could just sell its appliances.

&amp;#x200B;

That list included the following tickers/companies:

1. Sears Holdings (SHLD)
2. Sears Hometown &amp; Outlet Stores (SHOS)
3. **Amazon (AMZN)**

Wait WHAT? What did you just say?

&amp;#x200B;

Yes. Amazon. **Jeff Bezos pet project of Amazonafter his pet projects of fucking Americans through hedge fund D.E. Shaw but before the pet project of sending steel dildos into spacewas allowed to start selling Kenmore appliances back on Amazon .com in a year when SHOS was knocking it out of the park with 73% of all sales being appliance sales, and Kenmore alone being HALF of that.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3dt2pzn4y8m81.png?width=1319&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6a604d4a43f20a870fe85f92831dd4edac58e591

**So Lampert, who WASNT helping his own offshoot SHOS with their Kenmore brand, decided to suck the dick of Wish-brand Lex Luthor?**

&amp;#x200B;

**Its appeal wasnt just dedicated to bolstering Amazons digital presence either. It was looking for some sYnErGy in the shape of an object that Amazon was pushing into households more than any other: Alexa.**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The latest deal also allows owners of Amazons Alexa digital assistant to control digitally connected Kenmore appliances. That aspect was particularly appealing to Amazon, Amobi said.**  
&gt;  
&gt;""This is another way for them to advance the penetration of that technology,"" he said. ""This allows you to be able to activate your washing machine with voice control. It sounds quite appealing in some respects.""

&amp;#x200B;

![img](l5qabvv5y8m81 ""Got it! Deep fucking integration help for Bezos, but go fuck yourself to your own company. Thanks Eddie!
"")

**If we revisit our ""Taken"" monologue, we come to a stirring crossroads. Yes, there may very well be parent companies (Just like grizzled Liam Neesen-esque parents) willing to do everything to get their child back from the claws of bad actors.**

&amp;#x200B;

**But what happens, when the parent company simply doesn't care? Or even worse, tells the bad actors where their child is hiding?**

Despite these changes in the Kenmore brand and the lack of help from Lampert, investors in SHOS waved worries about these developments away. They felt SHOS as a company truly mattered and its appliance inventory truly mattered. It could stand on its own 2 feet.

But as SHOS investors diamond-handed their shares, they saw something else that far too many GME investors were familiar with.

# 6. 146 Days

While Sears SHLD stock was tanking faster and faster into 2017 after a stellar year, investors saw some weird shit happen.

&amp;#x200B;

**Eddie Lampert started buying SHOS stock in the open market. On Dec. 2017, in that single month he bought up 220K shares himself on the open stock market alongside retail investors like you. This was 1/30th of the float!**

&amp;#x200B;

[ Comment on Lampert from apparent Sears intern back in the day ](https://preview.redd.it/0ezv31k6y8m81.png?width=1087&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=6177f5ba69967300572c07578eff81e8eeee80d1)

Other funds, including Nantahala Capital Management (\~10% ownership, largest institutional shareholder), Chou Management, Royce &amp; Associates, &amp; Renaissance Technologies bought more or held during this time. Which all lead to a crazyyyy runaway effect.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets compare some fuckery shall we? On June 4th, 2013, Sears Hometown &amp; Outlet Stores (SHOS) nearly hit an all-time high price of \~$55. It had been riding high alongside Sears as a whole. Around that day, SHOS had \~2600 fails to delivers, or shares that had not been delivered.

&amp;#x200B;

During March 2018, it hit a small short squeeze while trading a $2 per share, which many SHOS investors who saw some deep ahem, value in the stock were ecstatic over. **And why was that?**

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**According to Nasdaq, short interest in SHOS soared over 50%,** from 2.05 million shares at October 13, 2017, to 3.27 million shares at November 30. (It remained at 3.2 million shares at 2/28/18.)  
&gt;  
&gt;**Apparently, the ""hard to borrow"" status of Sears Holdings has carried over to SHOS, causing some to mistakenly liken SHOS to SHLD, and blindly shorting it as a proxy for SHLD.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Indeed, SHOS may be setting itself up for the mother of all short squeezes. At 2/28/18, SHOS had a short ratio of 23%, and an astonishing days-to-cover ratio of 146...one of the highest days-to-cover ratios on the entire Nasdaq stock market! This compares to the SHLD figure of 18.5%, and a mere 9 days-to-cover.**  
&gt;  
&gt;If you factor in the fact that Eddie Lampert owns nearly 60% of the stock, and that 15% of the rest of the company is ""locked up"" in the hands of deep value investors that will likely not sell, without a significant price rise\*\*, the ""truly available float"" for shorting is probably only 25% of the outstanding shares, or 5.7 million shares. (This makes the short interest, as a percent of the adjusted float, sky high, and subject to a squeeze at any time!)\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

**Yes, here too motherfuckers. SHOS at one point was so damn shorted, it would have taken fucking 146 days to cover!**

And the fun literally did not stop there. Up until the stocks very last moments.

# 7. Down for the Count

In Oct. 2018, Sears own SHLD stock suffered a fate known to many heavily shorted stocks: it got delisted. I talked about this in another post:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**The timing was insane too. Remember how Q4 is always big for GME? Many were left going wtf at Sears filing for bankruptcy protection and closing \~150 stores a week before delisting, when there was a chance they could have held on longer.**  
&gt;  
&gt;Why? **Like ALL retailers, they usually make their most profits during Q4 and the Christmas season, big for all retailers whether GameStop or Sears.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7ur5rks9y8m81.png?width=640&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=1ba1afbb6a3eb0cefd7b0630c885e5dfd06a2bab

SHOS, unfortunately, eventually joined it.

Nearly 6 years later after SHOS all-time high in 2013&on August 28th, 2019, SHOS hit a price of \~$3.50. **On that day it hit 1.53 MILLION fails to deliver.** Two months later, the company was delisted at a similar price of $3.40.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Couldn't squeeze the whole chart well enough but you se the spike right before delisting ](https://preview.redd.it/hy3163oay8m81.png?width=1265&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d1195032d2bf0478fbb8ac0b499935994786c39f)

To give you an idea of how insane this number of FTDs, remember: GME hit 3.2 million FTDs in Oct. 2020 at a float of about \~65 million shares (equivalent proportion to 5% of all shares available to be purchased as FTDs).

&amp;#x200B;

**SHOS had issued shares of \~23 million (nearly 1/3rd of GME's) and had anywhere from 5 to 10 million shares in the float depending on who you asked! An utterly insane number and this may very well be the highest days to cover number I've seen, surpassing Tuesday Morning's 92 days to cover I found out about as well here:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Tuesday Morning at one point was shorted to the point woulda taken 92 days to cover](https://preview.redd.it/afyhbgvby8m81.png?width=663&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=082f2276d70929c531e1fa148868ce3908dd5f4c)

Despite all this fuckery, we saw how the story of Sears had petered out. Just like Sears had gone bankrupt, only a few months after Memento S.A. had called out the heavy naked shorting on the stock back in 2017, SHOS joined its parent company.

&amp;#x200B;

In the wake of its falling stock prices and just a few months before it got delisted, law firm Wolf Popper decided to step in as they saw that maybe Sears CEO Eddie Lampert was trying to fuck the smaller company arm:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Wolf Popper LLP is investigating potential claims on behalf of investors in Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores, Inc. (Nasdaq: SHOS), concerning the proposed going private transaction of Sears Hometown by Edward Lampert, Sears Hometown's majority shareholder, through his hedge fund ESL Investments, Inc.  According to Carl Stine, a partner at Wolf Popper LLP, ""Edward Lampert currently owns almost 60% of Sears Hometown's outstanding shares and his $2.25 per share offer looks like an attempt to steal the company with a low-ball bid.""

&amp;#x200B;

As far as I have been able to find, nothing has yet come out of Wolf Popper's look into SHOS and Lampert's potential attempt to get the company at a steal.

**It all comes to bear, like a game of ""Clue"" (or pick your ""whodunit"" movie): regardless of the hedge funds or market makers that may have also been involved, whom might have had a bigger hand in their fallout? Eddie Lampert, looking to get it for a steal? Or Jeff Bezos, looking to take out the biggest competition for one of the best selling appliance lines in the country?**

**Or, frankly, why not both?**

# 8. Collateral Damage: Revisiting the Story of Cool Holdings

While looking up the story of SHOS, I noticed that it echoed a lot of what I saw in another company I studied in my Spectator Mode DD on how stocks are delisted.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3hb4iupey8m81.png?width=660&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fb85f787015bd4374e54e0582cf6edeada8d90d4

I talked about how in Feb. 2020, GME had gone through some weird turbulence through its smaller associated stock to GME: Cool Holdings, which operated as a popular Apple goods reseller and bought out GME's Simply Mac business:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In Feb. 2020, Moodys had downgraded GMEs debt, and Cool Holdings, which was buying GameStops Simply Mac business, had missed its first installment payment to GameStop. GME, on its own ropes and in need of help, demanded that Cool Holdings pay back the total of $8 million it owed to it immediately.  
&gt;  
&gt;We havent seen much of Cool Holdings in recent posts on Superstonk surprisingly. Despite being one of the largest Apple Premium partners back in the day, it also had a run of unfortunateness.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kf3tifefy8m81.png?width=1142&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d799f0ae15bae441b0664002b340645f654a57a6

&gt;Cool Holdings got delisted itself just a few mere months prior, in Nov. 2019 by NASDAQ. This helped lead to that Motley Fool article only a few months later worrying for GME. Later on, Cool Holdings changed its name to Simply, Inc. and nowno lietrades under the ticker SIMP. Its new gamer tag/CUSIP is 82901A105.) And in the case of CUSIP, which had a float of about 56 million or so shares around the time of delisting, it had a single FTD spike of nearly 1.3 million just WEEKS before its first payment to GME was due\*\*. (For comparison, GME had a \~1.7 million FTD spike around the same time, with its biggest spike being 3.5 million but during the sneeze. 1.3 million FTDs for a float of 56 million is BIG.)

Cool Holdings made me think of SHOS and vice versa. Both were notto some degreethe parent companies. But were smaller offshoots (or related offshoots) that were shorted with even more FTDs relative to their floats.

It made me think that not only is a game plan for bad actors like big banks, prime brokers, hedge funds, market makers like Citadel &amp; Virtu, shitty CEO &amp; board like Eddie Lampert and Jim Bell, to drive down and naked short the stock of a company like Sears AND GME. But its also worth it to probably short down these offshoots EVEN MORE in companies like SHOS for Sears, or Cool Holdings for GME.

# 9. Kidnap the Child

When I first heard about RC's acquisition of 10% of BBBY (shoutout to u/ammoprofit on that!), I like many of you, lost my collective shit. **In fact, I found out about the buy-in WHILE I was finishing wrapping up this post;** I decided not to add anything about BBBY then but know that mighta been a mistake now.

For just like the Sears &amp; SHOS, or GME &amp; Cool Holdings, the story of BBBY and one of its very own offshoots might be central to our storyline today.

buybuyBaby was founded by brothers Richard &amp; Jeffrey Feinstein back in 1996. It was eventually acquired in 2007 by Bed Bath &amp; Beyond in 2007. **And for years, it only had 1 real big retail competitor: Babies 'R Us, owned by Toys' R Us who eventually filed for bankruptcy in 2018 around the same year that Sears went under (is this all starting to sound familiar?)**

\*\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now Bed Bath hadn't just acquired buybuyBaby during its run. From 2002-2017, it had also acquired Harmon Face Values, The Christmas Tree Shops, Cost Plus World Market, One Kings Lane, and [Personalizationmall.com](https://Personalizationmall.com).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The previous leaders of Bed Bath never adequately articulated why these acquisitions  were good for Bed Bath, and never provided information about the financial performance of the individual brands after they were acquired. **That may make it easy for the new leaders to sell the acquired chains off quickly, without needing to offer an explanation. And potential buyers are already making offers...**

**In Oct. 2019,** **Placer. ai** **found that 4 of those acquisitions, including Bed Bath ""could be strong performers, either as sold-off assets, or as part of a re-imagined Bed Bath."" A group of activist investors known as ""Restore BedBath"" argued selling off non-core assets and inventory rationalization could net a $2 billion windfall if the company nutted the fuck up.**

**But guess which company of the 4 acquisitions had done the best in terms of longest shopper visits? That's right, BuyBuyBaby, with average visits lasting 52 min.** (The next closest was Christmas Tree Shops at 46.) **This is all as CNBC's Maggie Fitzgerald wrote that BuyBuy Baby ALONE may have been worth more than ALL OF BBBY the very next year, in the midst of the pandemic and months before the meme stock sneeze.**

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kls1u8g969m81.png?width=885&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=92e8b346c57814d5c961d1e99c231783bfea529e

&gt;**""\[Bank of America\] estimates Buybuy Baby's enterprise value is equal to nearly all the current enterprise value of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.""**

&amp;#x200B;

And this isn't counting the deals that it had done during the pandemic, including with Shipt and Uber to race and get more baby goods to parents staying at home, while still offering an often highly rated baby registry competing with another big: Amazon.

&amp;#x200B;

So even buybuyBaby's (and BBBY's story) may not be in a vacuum, dear apes. And it is context like these that reminds us of our monologue.

We were always worried, and oftentimes laughed and meme'd about Ken Griffin, Doug Cifu, Stevie Cohen and all the other financial terrorists worried about marge calling. And at this point, we know the fuckery is beyond all bounds. We even see in the spike in nickel commodities earlier that these fuckers won't even get fucking margin called, and have no one to answer to.

&amp;#x200B;

But maybe now they do. **What happens when you have a Chairman with BDE oozing out his pores, who probably knows about how parent companies and their children in Sears &amp; SHOS, early GME &amp; Cool Holdings, and BBBY &amp; BuyBuyBaby turned out? Maybe Ken doesn't need to fear Marge anymore. Maybe the next time he picks up the phone, he will hear a very different voice, and a very different tune...**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

* **SHOS, or Sears Hometown &amp; Outdoors Stores, spun off from Sears in 2012. It had done strong, consistent numbers in 2016 and 2017, making nearly 72+% of all its revenue from its appliances' line including Sears-brand Kenmore, as well as others.**
* **Despite strong sales for Kenmore appliances, parent company/Sears CEO Eddie Lampert did barely anything to help out SHOS or Kenmore's appliance line. On the other hand, in 2017, Lampert decided to allow Jeff Bezos' Amazon to be the ONLY non-Sears company to sell Kenmore. Those appliances were then allowed to be Alexa-compliant. (This all may perhaps very well be one of the first direct/indirect links to the infamous ""Busting out the Competition"" DD).**
* **In 2018, SHOS encountered a crazy amount of short interest, even more so than Sears. At one point, it would have taken 146 days to cover all the shorted shares, and had 1.5 million FTDs shortly before delisting.**
* **SHOS' story is very very similar to GameStop's Cool Holdings/Simply Mac business,  a related GME company that was potentially shorted even more than** **GME.  BedBath's BuyBuyBaby may have encountered a similar ""kidnap the child"" scenario, where BedBath's liquidation meant grabbing Baby's offerings at a steal.**

I liked the first parts, where you challenge the narrator's decisions for Stanley and explore your way through the empty office building. It's something of a walking simulator, with a wicked sense of humour, and generally satisfying Easter eggs to be found. I beat the main routes, and decided to keep going through the achievements, snapping up things like the ""Speed run"".

I was playing on a Monday night so it was easy enough to get the achievement ""Commitment - Play The Stanley Parable for the entire duration of a Tuesday."" Then the game said I had to go outside, so I did and worked away the next few weeks. I joined a board game club, and met some really good people there. The Stanley Parable has a much bigger social element than anything else I've played, almost like a MMORPG. And at the club I met a great woman, and we started hanging out more. I picked her as my romance option. Lots of games have bullshit filler for the achievements, but here it seemed like the choices I was making on the road to 100% completion really mattered.

I followed a job to a new city and she moved with me. Through this job I was able to save money, and eventually quit to make games freelance for a while. I asked her to marry me, and she said yes. We got a dog, and he's a real dickhead but we love him.

The game isn't always easy. Marketing videogames is hard, so I didn't make much money from game dev, but I did start tutoring in the meantime which paid the bills. Then they added a pandemic event, which I'm not such a great fan of, but I kept playing. I married my romance option in between lockdowns, and we were only able to have 4 NPCs as guests.

We moved to a different region as I reclassed into another job. Now we're waiting for our baby to spawn in, which I'm told will change my gameplay forever.

Today I was allowed to load the .exe in Steam and finally claim the last achievement: ""Go outside - Don't play The Stanley Parable for five years."" It was fun 100%ing it - I learned a lot about myself, and was able to experience some real emotional highs and lows.

I just don't understand it.

It's been over 3 years since my brother died. He was getting ready to be a father, super athletic and full of positivity. But he had an achilles heel- his asthma.

I had it with him, so I know how bad it could get. But, while I grew out of it, his was still so severe that he needed his pump around him at all times. Long story short, one day he didn't have it and he died. All that effort to fight it off and it ultimately got him in the end- 3 months before his first and only son would be born.

Now with that knowledge, you'd think his widow- who loved him so much- would do everything in her power to protect that baby. It wouldn't be too long before COVID would arrive after all, the largest worldwide pandemic that killed countless people...it would be wise to you know, protect the baby. Get him vaccinated maybe.

It was a hard NO.

""I don't trust these doctors who say it'll help us,"" she said, ""Don't you remember they used to have black people experimented on for diseases? They could be doing the same thing now, and I won't get my son involved in that.""

Yeah, I get the concern, but...your son is coughing violently. From the time he was little.

A year later, he only got worse and would need to take many hospital trips.

You ordered respirators, and he got COVID over and over again before he turned 3.

And yet...it's not even a consideration.

No, I don't want to consider getting my shot vaccinated to give him a stronger immune system so he wouldn't end up like his dad. Just roughing it out in life with no shield at all...

I know he's not the only baby who doesn't have vaccines, but he's in an environment where he has access to greater help for his illness. What really gets me too is how she was told by doctors that the baby DOESN'T have asthma. He just gets more sick because he's not vaccinated.

So, you still sneak him into schools until the staff realized he does have his shots and you yank him right out? Putting other kids at risk. You may be okay with it, but imagine a parent who has to take their kid to a hospital and they are seriously ill from contracting something from your son, and your only excuse is, ""I didn't want to vaccinate my child, but I put him in the school anyway."" 

It's not just him either. They ALL got COVID (SIL &amp; her mother) and they still go to work without telling anybody. Her mom's job in particular involves caring for the elderly, and she didn't tell her boss she got COVID.

I can't take this. just I can't.

It's too ridiculous.

She can't be serious.

I wonder if my brother would've said anything about this, but I can't ponder too long. All I know is, as a CF woman, I still care for children and if something happens to that baby, I will lose it.","childfree",1777,1777,0,0.96,1,0,0,178

They packed up my stuff overnight and they left without telling me what I had done wrong. The pain I felt that day was the worst I've ever felt. It was greater than the abuse I experienced from my biological family and it was worse than major surgery. It was the kind of pain that convinces you it is possible to die from a broken heart. I told myself that day I would never again get close to someone and give them the power to hurt me like that. I promised myself I would never ever love a family again.

At age 17, the final foster home in the entire county was kicking me out. My old high school physics teacher found out I was moving to a foster home across the state and he and his wife took me in so I could stay at the same school. I thought like everyone else they'd be gone in a year tops... but they never went away. Even after graduating high school, they stayed in touch all throughout college. They'd visit me for breakfast and football games, and I'd stay with them for holidays. They even let me move back in with them during the covid pandemic. 

Even after knowing them for 7 years, I have always only called them by their first names. Last Christmas, I received a gift from ""Jen/Mom,"" and I cried my heart out. All my life, ""mom"" was this awful woman who would starve me, degrade me, and beat me with belts. And now here was Jen rewriting the definition of ""mother"".

I'm 24 now. I broke the decade-old promise to myself and I fell in love with my new parents. I was adopted 2.5 months ago. 

Even after the adoption, I'm still scared to call them mom and dad. I know it's irrational, but there's something still in me that's terrified they're going to disappear tomorrow, like so many families have before them. I guess it's engrained in me that vocalizing ""mom"" is kind of like saying ""Lord Voldemort."" It's taboo and only triggers chaos.

I got over my fear and called Jen ""mom"" tonight. It was only over text, but I'm trying to take baby steps. It was uncomfortable, but I did it because unlike my DNA donor, Jen deserves to be called ""mom"".","offmychest",1746,1746,0,1,8,1,0,77

Our parents were best friends before we were born. We grew up together, but she was always a little judgmental and mean. When we were teenagers she would comment on my weight constantly. When I got sick (I was anorexic), she stopped talking to me. Red flag, I know. But when youre 16 you just want your friends to like you. 

We naturally drifted apart. Then we reconnected during the pandemic and she admitted to being a shitty person. It was the validation I needed after bodyshaming and things she did that I dont even want anonymously posted. She was a bad person is all you need to know. 

So we planned to go to dinner. Then came the sales pitch. I was like no thank you I am very adept when it comes to hair care and skincare and have a routine. She accused me of being anti-woman. I told her off and many expletives were involved. 

Shes recently joined an evangelical church that Monat Huns attend, had a baby even though she has no job, and the last thing she said to me was that I needed to go to therapy because I was jealous.","antiMLM",1748,1748,0,0.98,0,0,0,100

I personally know several women who had babies between 2020-2022, and I'm just...like...WHAT?? The entire world was in literal crisis, everything was uncertain, and what do people decide...? That it's THE perfect time to spawn....? WHAT??

A family friend told us that pretty much all the women in his small town were expecting during lockdown, and they intentionally got pregnant in order to ""replenish the population"" (as we were losing people to Covid). What a selfless, heroic, patriotic deed. /s =D

Edit: some of you seem to think I'm basing the baby boom claim solely by my own and my friend's experiences in the second part. I got the baby boom info from a national news source (I believe it was CNN but I can't be sure). These are 2 separate statements. I thought it was clear enough but apparently not to everyone. Please read things carefully.

Edit 2: if I could change the title to ""presumed baby boom"", I would, but since I can't - and so many people are commenting with the sole intention of proving there was not an official boom - I will simply say that I am NOT an expert. I saw a headline a couple of weeks ago and read a story on one of the national news sites. Was reminded of it today. Made the foolish choice to start a discussion and share my opinions/experience. Boom, debaters come out of the woodwork to say it's all in my head, it didn't happen, no that's not true, etc. You can debate it all you like, but I'm done.

People. Don't back expensive Kickstarters if you are not prepared to pay for the actual shipping costs. You look like an entitled baby when you rant in the comments at a first time independent board game creator about how shocked and angry you are that the $150 14kg box you ordered a year ago costs more than half that to arrive at your door. It shouldn't be a surprise anymore. Assume it when you back, and plan for it. Or. Don't. Back. It. 

Yeah, it sucks. We're all watching our hard-earned money evaporate because greedy sociopaths are milking a global pandemic to price gouge consumers. But your indie game developer cutting out prototypes at their kitchen table after dinner is most likely not one of them, so STOP TAKING IT OUT ON THEM. 

They don't want to charge you that much. But they don't have the relationships with logistics partners, and the number of backers, and the experience with manufacturing, and the prescience about the future state of the economy, needed to negotiate and predict the best rate 12-18 months ahead of time. 

If you can't pay $50 to $75 shipping (depending on the country) for a $150 board game that weighs as much as a 4-month old baby, you shouldn't be backing the game. At this point, being surprised that you have to actually pay a lot to ship a giant box of plastic is on you, not on the creator.

There. Thank you for letting me get that off my chest.

Weve been together for only 16 months (but weve been friends for a decade), so, due to the pandemic, the only person I know from his family is his mother.

The wedding happens to be only 9 days after my due date, so I said from the beginning that I probably wont be able to attend. I probably will have my baby before, but he wont be more than 2-weeks-old the day of the wedding. Im a new mother and Im not comfortable leaving my 2-weeks-old baby, even with my parents, and Im also not comfortable bringing him to a wedding, 3 hours away from home, with 100 strangers and their germs, during a pandemic. I also dont know how things will go, maybe Ill have a C-section or be hospitalized a couple days, theres no way to tell. Also, personally, Im not sure I would like someone to bring a newborn to my wedding&

So, Im 38 weeks pregnant and my MIL told us that she paid for our dinner anyway so, if we feel differently then, we could go. I told her that it was nice of her but I dont think this is realistic and exposed all my arguments when she insisted. She told me that its just not fair that my baby wont have the same « access » to his 2 sides of family because I just dont want to go. To be clear, I wouldnt go either if the wedding was on MY side. Like I said, I havent met any of my boyfriends family, not because I dont want to, but because nobody ever showed interest in seeing us. Weve been in a lot of gatherings and birthday partys in my family, because were close and they cares to invite us. I dont think its fair of my MIL to make me feel like im in the wrong only because she wont be able to show-off her days-old grandson to her family right after hes born. There will be more occasions, and they can always come see us at home if they want to.

AITA here ?

EDIT : My BF is on my side. He may attend the wedding, but only if our situation allows it and Im ok with that. Its his family and I can handle myself for a night, if not, my parents are close by.

EDIT 2 : Theres many comments saying theres a lot of chance I will still be pregnant the day of the wedding. I mentionned I will probably have my baby before because im supposed to be induced early for medical reasons. But baby will still be only a few days old anyway.

Forgive typos I'm a little emotional.

I have known my childhood friend since we were about 2 years old I'm in my late 20s-early 30s and she is my oldest friend, however over the years, I have always been the more giving person in the friendship but it never bothered me until now. 

Back in 2017 I was having a rough time mentally and I spoke to her about my dark thoughts of taking my own life when I told her this she stated that if I ever did that, I better make sure she and her future children were in my will or she would be upset and skip my funeral. She never tried to say anything to aid my mental state. When I asked her about it she said she was joking out of fear and shock of what I had told her.

I'm currently out of the country I'm from the USA Cali to be exact. I have a large property with a seperate guest house she has been renting it since the pandemic, during the pandemic she met a man on POF and decided to have a baby with him and move him into the guest house, everything was fine still. Now this year the baby turned 1 years old and I'm still out of the country.

The other day I got an email notification from my utilities company about the main house, so I call her and ask her to check it out and that's when she informs me that she and her boyfriend and the baby have moved into the main house because the guest house is to small for the baby now that he is walking around and talking he needs more space and they need more space. 

I'm shocked by this and I tell her right away that they can't stay there and she says she doesn't see the point since I'm not using the property and that even when I come back I always stay at my condo in Carmel so she didn't see why I was so upset. She also said that she hadn't been paying the rent to the account I had setup to collect it (I didn't check the account for a few month's ny own fault for that)  she went on to say that she was not going to pay any rent because the property was empty and I wasn't making any money on it before. She said that the market in California is hard for small families to rent or buy, and that they planned to stay at my house for a few years and save her excuse also being that since I didn't have children and don't plan on having any it shouldn't bother me at all. 

She also berated me for not making a effort to come and meet her son after which she said that make sure he receives an inheritance because its selfish that I have all this money to myself. That she always thought I would be like a fairy godmother to her children as payment for crushing her  dreams since she wanted us to have kids at the same time so they could be best friends too that since I'm failing at that I owe her this for all the disappointment.

What makes this worse is when I spoke to my own cousin about this her response was simply ""she's not wrong you don't need all that"" 

I think I'm also mad at myself because I'm starting to feel like maybe it is greedy and I should give what she is asking my something inside me says this is all wrong.

At this point I just wonder what other people would do in a situation like this ?

Aside from this she really is not a bad person but ever since she found out that I didn't want children it did something to our friendship.

She doesn't feel like my friend anymore but it's hard letting go of a childhood friend.
They way she worded everything makes me feel selfish even I was always happy with my choices. 

Do you guys think our friendship can be saved ?
Do think I'm being selfish?
