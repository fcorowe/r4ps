Recently I had a family get together at my house. Me and my husband host these get together once a month to catch up with family and our close friends over a shared meal. There is usually around ten of us and we are all very close. This past get together my son L brought his girlfriend S of a year with him. I never had any problems with my children bringing their partners to these get together. I have never really liked S, but I try not to allow that effect my sons relationship with her as it isnt my place. My husband also doesnt have the best views of S. We have our reasons for our dislike of her. 
S is often rude and causally says rude things about other family members. She is doesnt clean up after herself and moves furniture in my home while she is here. I wouldnt mind that as much but my SIL is blind so this causes some problems. She makes remarks about my daughters struggles with fertility, which has been causing my daughter a lot of emotional pain. Along with just being an ass to my daughter in general .
She also mistreats L , often yelling at him, belittling, and gaslighting him. She scolds him like he is a child over things like him not doing enough chores at their apartment. She is unemployed and lives at his apartment while he works long hours. Over all not a pleasant person.  I have tried to explain to my son that the way she treats him is unacceptable and that they should honestly break up.
A few weeks ago S kicked my son out of his own apartment over an argument. He said he was threw with her and I thought that was the last of it. 
This past get together S was there with L. I didnt press or ask questions as it wasnt my business. After the main course while everyone was relaxing and chatting at the dining table S and L stood up saying they had news. S had recently found out she was pregnant. Everyone congratulated the two, while my stomach sank. I could tell something was off with L as well. He had always wanted kids but he didnt look excited. 
S began talking about how excited we must be to finally after so long be having our first grand baby. My daughter looks upset but still congratulated her. Me and my husband just stayed quiet. We quietly congratulated our son who looked miserable before bring out dessert. 
Recently I have been getting a lot of angry text from S saying how disappointed she was in us for not being over the moon about our first grand baby. And how we didnt seem all to thrilled. She accused us of hating her and being racist towards the mother of our grand child (I am not white) and how we would have no contact with her or L until we apologized.
A couple of friends and family have said I should have just sucked it up, but I dont think I was in the wrong. Im worried about L who I havent heard from since the get together.
So Reddit AITA?

Edit and small update: I just thought I would add a bit more information that I neglected to add. I am 61, L is 28, S is around the same age. 

Ive already mentioned in a comment but thought I would say it here. Me and husband havent been able to contact L, he wont respond to text or pick up the phone before work. He did reach out and apologize to our daughter and SIL for not telling them ahead of time. Husband &amp; I plan to swing by Ls work while hes on break to talk to him.

Secretary of the defence Norbert Braun smashed a bundle of documents at Rick van Hout desk and held him a newspaper into the face.

Are. You. Fucking. Kidding. Me.

Van Hout looked at the headline, his face becoming sour.

Braun reads the headline aloud and angry European Defence Agency procures 98,000 Standard Missile 5 for the fight against the Eurasian Axis, Tesla-Raytheon-Defence rises 17,6%.

What? We never ordered 98.000 of these! It was my project, we requested a test batch of 98 units and that is what was written in the contract! van Hout defended himself.

No, seriously, I read it five times, you have signed a contract over 98000 SM-5 missiles! Who the hell needs 98.000 intercontinental hunter-killer missiles with multiple warheads?

Van Hout gasps. Oh my good. These stupid Yankees use commas for separating thousands and everyone else is using points. But I never put commas or points into the contract?

Please tell me you signed the papers on embassy ground.

Well, we wanted to but then we went over to Luigi for lunch& and that is US territory. And subject to a US court.

You just ordered enough firepower to wipe out a dozen alien invasion fleets for a little under 320 billion euros. You Dumbfuck!

\---

Two weeks later van Hout was leaving the council building. The situation somewhat cleared up. It was a conversion mistake between Excel and Word and only appeared in a last minute change when Rick changed the name of a deceased lawyer. Rick was demoted and sent to Dirtistan, signing export papers for manure for the rest of his life.

It took a year of diplomatic talks to lower the order to 73000 units and a hefty mass rebate drove the price down to 110 billion euros. Also half of the units would be produced in Europe. The usual diplomatic trade bullshit. Also after the first 500 units the EDA received an upgraded Block 2 version, and later even more upgraded block 3 and block 4 versions for the same price. Still, the deal made Tesla-Raytheon-Defence piles of money.

Even though these missiles were crazy expensive they worked well and kept improving from batch to batch. Fired from a distance up to 2000 klicks they searched for targets, evaluated them and then closed in, swarmed the objective while taking crazy evasion maneuvers. The Eurasian Axis lost all air control in just two weeks, nearly every armoured vehicle a month later and when Block 3 arrived in numbers their orbital assets went the way of the Dodo too.

Still having around 65000 units to spend the EDA used them to hunt everything down to squad size units. Sure, that was an expensive overkill but then the stuff was lying around, had no other use and governments love saving money by wasting it. Two months later most forces of the Eurasian Axis had surrendered or rebelled.

The war was over and there were still 43000 SM-5 systems left. The EDA had no use for these and sold most of them cheaply to their allies.

The war was expensive but at least quick and with little own losses. The story could have been over here except Humanity made a bad first contact.

\---

When a fleet of alien star ships entered the solar system and told us we had the honour of becoming the sixth servant race of their mighty empire everyone was sure we were all doomed. We had only a handful of tiny scientific interplanetary ships and not a single armed one. So we tried to bargain the best possible conditions without fighting back.

Things went from bad to worse when a single SM-5 forgotten in the orbit over the former Eurasian enemy decided it didnt like the enemies flag ship. It send a short note to SHAPE that it identified an eurasian submarine in low earth orbit and blew a big fat hole into it.

Now the new offer was to level our cities and enslave all our people. Without nothing to lose we just activated the roughly 100 SM-5 still loitering in orbit.

And the war was over before it began. The 100 SM-5 simply shredded half of the enemy force with them not even knowing what hit em. They retreated while warning us they would be back with reinforcements and the next battle would be different.

It wasnt. They came, we send a swarm of SM-5, they died. Over and over again. Even when their fourth fleet was twenty times larger than their first fleet. We didnt even had to use Block 4 units. We just hit them with old Block 2 and surplus Block 3. Often they died far away from earth orbit and all their ordinance fired at our home world was simply taken out by some more SM-5.

Again and Again and Again.

They lost nearly 6.000 star ships, with a total tonnage of 210 million. It was a massacre.

Just five years later we still had 18,000 Block 3 and Block 4 units, not to mention another 350,000 freshly produced Block 5 and 6 units. Then the attacks stopped. So we thought it was time for a return visit. We scraped together all the wrecks, patched up the holes and planned big battles.

The big battles never happened. For most of the enemies 30 worlds it was enough to send in a large freighter and spill a couple of hundreds SM-5 outside. They took care of the space born resistance and the planets themselves usually surrendered quickly.

All in all ten years after first contact humanity had liberated 30 planets from slavery.

\---

We have a problem. Many of the 30 liberated worlds are close to famine.

Ex-Ambassador Braun looked up from his glass of red wine into the face of his successor Marguerite Jabotinsky, who just had arrived next to him. They both were sitting at Luigi's in New York, enjoying a lovely evening sunset.

Well, Marguerite, no one would have expected for the enemy to falter that fast and on such a scale. May I offer you a glass of wine?

Thanks, I guess I need a drink anyway. We could easily lose all our gains, our popular support from the liberated aliens if the situation gets worse. Arent any earth nations able to increase food production? Tapping into reserves?

Well, sorry but the world production of food is already at its limit, there simply isnt enough land. And no matter how deep we dig into the reserves, it wont be enough for 30 worlds. They need to increase food production locally. But dont ask me how. They would need hundreds of million tons of fertilizer.

Marguerites phone rang. She took the phone, listened for a moment. Disbelieve in her eyes. Then she laughed and hung up.

You wouldnt believe what I was just told! Some dumbfuck assistant of our dirtistan embassy had accidentally ordered one fucking billion tons of fertilizer last year instead of one million and now nobody knows what to do with it.

Let me guess, his name was Rick van Hout?

#The Constitution

First, let us talk about the Constitution. As the House Judiciary Republicans [reminded](https://twitter.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1521550726274719744?s=20&amp;t=9cZBqL2ldSrX_3rGNdr8cg) us this week, the word abortion is not in the Constitution.

Neither is the word women. The white men who wrote the Constitution did not think women were people, deserving of the same rights as men. Women couldnt vote or own property. Couldnt hold office, nor choose their husbands. Parts of America still allowed marital rape into the [1990s](http://www.ncdsv.org/images/NCVC_SpousalRapeLaws20YearsLater_2004.pdf), defining rape as forced sexual intercourse by a male with a ""female not his wife. 

If you happened to be a Black woman at the founding of America, your rights were even more nonexistent. Black women could be raped with impunity, their children born into the same shackles of slavery as their mothereven if their father was a white slave owner. 

The men who believed this was the way of a justly ordered world wrote the Constitution, which is still viewed by many Americans as a rigid instruction manual to form the best nation possible.

#Roe v. Wade

The roots of Roe v. Wade can be found in [Griswold v. Connecticut](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/381/479) (1965). The case involved an 1873 Connecticut statute that banned the use of ""any drug, medicinal article, or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception. Estelle Griswold, the Executive Director of Planned Parenthood in Connecticut, opened a birth control clinic in New Haven in 1961 to provide married women with contraceptives. She and her partner, gynecologist C. Lee Buxton, were arrested 10 days after opening.

* Keep in mind, Griswold and Buxton were giving out birth control pills (approved by the FDA in 1960) to women. For decades prior, men faced no penalty for distributing or obtaining condoms. In fact, the government [gave](https://daily.jstor.org/short-history-of-the-condom/) American troops condoms for free during the Second World War to use while engaging prostitutes. Would Griswold and Buxton have been arrested for handing out condoms? Likely not. So whats the difference? Armed with the pill, a woman has just as much physical power to veto reproduction as a man. Griswold and Buxton were handing out equality.

The law they were convicted of violating is known as a Comstock law, referring to anti-vice Christian activist [Anthony Comstock](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/pill-anthony-comstocks-chastity-laws/). Following the Civil War, Comstock was so revolted by ads for birth control that he went on a crusade against anything he considered ""obscene, lewd, or lascivious""prohibiting the mailing of material pertaining to contraceptives, the prevention of venereal disease, anatomy textbooks, and even racy letters. Congress enshrined his campaign into federal law, and states followed.

The Supreme Court ultimately ruled 7-2 that *married couples* are guaranteed the right of privacy (personal liberty) that covers their use of contraceptives like birth control pills. The majority, led by Justice William Douglas, [argued](https://www.thirteen.org/wnet/supremecourt/rights/landmark_griswold.html) that the marital privacy right was implied by the Bill of Rightsa constitutionally protected personal liberty despite not being specifically enumerated in the Constitution.

&gt;Justice Douglas contended that the Bill of Right's specific guarantees have ""penumbras,"" created by ""emanations from these guarantees that help give them life and opinion."" In other words, the ""spirit"" of the First Amendment (free speech), Third Amendment (prohibition on the forced quartering of troops), Fourth Amendment (freedom from searches and seizures), Fifth Amendment (freedom from self-incrimination), and Ninth Amendment (other rights), as applied against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment, creates a general ""right to privacy"" that cannot be unduly infringed.


As with abortion, the right to privacy is not found in the Constitution. However, privacy is key to many of the rights enumerated by the Constitution, as Elie Mystal explains (in Allow Me to Retort):

&gt;Many of the rights explicitly protected in the
Constitution dont make sense unless this unenumerated right to
privacy is also protected. What good is a protection from unreasonable
searches if there is no protection from being unreasonably
monitored? What good is the right to form an association, if the FBI
can just wiretap any meeting it doesnt like? What freedom do we really have if the government can shove a camera up your hooha to
see if theres any funny business going on?

It took seven more years for the Supreme Court to extend this right to privacy to unmarried couples (Eisenstadt v. Baird), eight years for the court to recognize a constitutional right to abortion in the first trimester (Roe v. Wade), and 27 years for the court to allow abortion up until viability and define unacceptable abortion restrictions (Planned Parenthood v. Casey).

##Alitos draft

The fact of the matter is that Griswold and Roe rely on privacy rights to legalize contraceptives and abortion. While this got the job done, it ignores a more obvious route to legalize abortion and give women control over their own bodies: the Equal Protection Clause. In other words, the argument that restrictions on the right to abortion constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination.

&gt;[UCLA Law Review](https://www.uclalawreview.org/the-equality-argument-for-abortion-rights/): Equality arguments for abortion rights range widely but share certain core concerns. Sex equality arguments ask whether abortion restrictions are shaped solely by the states interest in protecting potential life, or whether such laws might also reflect constitutionally suspect judgments about women. For ex­ample, does the state act consistently to protect potential life outside the abor­tion context, including by offering prenatal care and job protections to women who want to become mothers?  Or is the state selective in protecting potential life?  If so, might abortion restrictions reflect traditional sex-role stereotypes about sex, caregiving, or decision-making around motherhood?

&gt;Equality arguments are also concerned about the gendered impact of abortion restrictions. Sex equality arguments observe that abortion restrictions deprive women of control over the timing of motherhood and so predictably exacerbate the inequalities in educational, economic, and political life engen­dered by childbearing and childrearing. Sex equality arguments ask whether, in protecting unborn life, the state has taken steps to ameliorate the effects of compelled motherhood on women, or whether the state has proceeded with indifference to the impact of its actions on women. Liberty arguments focus less on these gendered biases and burdens on women.

The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg believed the Equal Protection Clause to be the more legally sound method of protecting abortion rights, [writing](https://www.aclu.org/news/reproductive-freedom/for-justice-ginsburg-abortion-was-about-equality): [L]egal challenges to undue restrictions on abortion procedures do not seek to vindicate some generalized notion of privacy; rather, they center on a womans autonomy to determine her lifes course, and thus to enjoy equal citizenship stature.

This oversight (or, rather, deliberate decision by the Supreme Court of old not to give women equal status to men) allows Justice Samuel Alito to strike down Roe V. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey on the grounds that privacy is not found in the Constitution.

&gt;Roe, however, was remarkably loose in its treatment of the constitutional text. It held that the abortion right, which is not mentioned in the Constitution, is part of a right to privacy, which is also not mentioned. &And that privacy right, Roe observed, had been found to spring from no fewer than five different constitutional provisionsthe First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

&gt;...guided by the history and tradition that map the essential components of our Nation's concept of ordered liberty, we must ask what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term liberty. When we engage in that inquiry in the present case, the clear answer is that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion

*While one can argue Griswold, Roe, and subsequent cases should have focused on the Equal Protection Clause, that is no guarantee that todays conservative majority would not invent cause to exempt abortion under any statute. Indeed, Alito briefly mentions the Equal Protection Clause in his draft opinion, saying [t]he regulation of a medical procedure that only one sex can undergo does not trigger heightened constitutional scrutiny.*

---

##Right to contraceptives

Alito targeted the right to privacy in his draft opinion striking down Roe and Casey, opening the way for other rights based on the same privacy arguments to similarly be overturned. The first of these, as discussed above, is Griswold and Eisenstadtguaranteeing the right to birth control for married *and* unmarried women. It is not much of a leap to go from women have no right to choose not to give birth to women have no right to control their reproductive cycle, after all.


**This isnt hypothetical.** Republican states have already advanced bills meant to limit access to birth control. Just days after Alitos draft leaked to the public, Louisiana lawmakers on a State House of Representatives committee [approved](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/us/louisiana-abortion-bill-homicide.html) a bill that would not only classify abortion as homicide, but would also criminalize in vitro fertilization and forms of birth control.

---

##Right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts

Alito specifically mentions two other Supreme Court decisions that protect rights not deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition (as he asserts abortion is not). One of these is [Lawrence v. Texas](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-102.ZS.html) (2003), in which a 6-3 court held that laws criminalizing same-sex sodomy are unconstitutional. 

In 1998, officers responded to a dangerous weapon call at the apartment of John Geddes Lawrence Jr. in Houston, Texas. Upon entering the premises, the cops found Lawrence and a male acquaintance having anal sex in the bedroom. They were arrested and charged with having deviate sex under Texas Homosexual Conduct law (which is still in the states legal code).

Like Roe and Griswold, the Lawrence majority held that Texas' law violated the Constitutions right to privacy. 

&gt;Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds. Liberty presumes an autonomy of self that includes freedom of thought, belief, expression, and certain intimate conduct. The instant case involves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions&

&gt;The case does involve two adults who, with full and mutual consent from each other, engaged in sexual practices common to a homosexual lifestyle. The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime&

&gt;Had those who drew and ratified the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment known the components of liberty in its manifold possibilities, they might have been more specific. They did not presume to have this insight. They knew times can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress. As the Constitution endures, persons in every generation can invoke its principles in their own search for greater freedom.

To overturn Roe because the right of privacy is not guaranteed is to unwind a spool of thread that leads directly to Lawrence. 

---

##Right to same-sex marriage

The other case explicitly mentioned by Alito as on the deeply rooted in history chopping block is Obergefell v. Hodges.

The cases abbreviated title comes from [Jim Obergefell and John Arthurs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-jim-obergefell-became-the-face-of-the-supreme-court-gay-marriage-case/2015/04/06/3740433c-d958-11e4-b3f2-607bd612aeac_story.html) lawsuit seeking to have Ohio recognize their same-sex marriage obtained in Maryland, but the plaintiffs of six lower-court cases were included in the Supreme Courts arguments. 

Justice Anthony Kennedy authored the majority opinion ([pdf](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf)), joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. 

&gt;Like choices concerning contraception, family relationships, procreation, and childrearing, all of which are protected by the Constitution, decisions concerning marriage are among the most intimate that an individual can make. Indeed, the Court has noted it would be contradictory to recognize a right of privacy with respect to other matters of family life and not with respect to the decision to enter the relationship that is the foundation of the family in our society. 

As weve seen, the conservative majority is on the verge of taking one of these right[s] to personal choiceprocreationaway. How long until the others follow?

Note: Alitos dissent in Obergefell previewed his draft opinion overturning Roe. Namely, that same-sex marriage is not deeply rooted in history:

&gt;To prevent five unelected Justices from imposing their personal vision of liberty upon the American people, the Court has held that liberty under the Due Process Clause should be understood to protect only those rights that are deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition. And it is beyond dispute that the right to same-sex marriage is not among those rights&

&gt;For todays majority, it does not matter that the right to same-sex marriage lacks deep roots or even that it is contrary to long-established tradition. 

---

##Right to interracial marriage

At first glance, it may seem like the right to interracial marriage is not related to abortion. However, courts and commentators place Loving in the line of privacy cases that begins with Griswold (the right to contraceptives) and in turn led to Roe v. Wade. Undermining one undermines all.

Loving centers on the anti-miscegenation law of Virginia in the 1950s. Mildred Loving, a mixed race woman, traveled to Washington D.C. in 1958 to marry her high school sweetheart, Robert Lovinga white man. A few weeks after returning to Virginia, local police arrested the Lovings and charged them with violating Section 20-58 and Section 20-59 of the Virginia Code. The couple was forced to leave the state.

It took nearly a decade, but in 1967 the Supreme Court unanimously [struck down](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/loving.html) Virginias law, finding that the freedom to marry is a fundamental liberty protected by the Constitution:

 &gt;These statutes also deprive the Lovings of liberty without due process of law in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The freedom to marry has long been recognized as one of the vital personal rights essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.

&gt;Marriage is one of the ""basic civil rights of man,"" fundamental to our very existence and survival. To deny this fundamental freedom on so unsupportable a basis as the racial classifications embodied in these statutes, classifications so directly subversive of the principle of equality at the heart of the Fourteenth Amendment, is surely to deprive all the State's citizens of liberty without due process of law.

Again, we see a liberty that did not exist at the time of the founding fathers; a liberty that is not deeply rooted in history. We also see an analog to Obergefell and Lawrence, the discrimination of the Virginia statute not far from the discrimination of laws prohibiting same-sex marriage and same-sex intimate relations. 

---
---

Finally, looking back where we began: the Constitution. Just as the word women is not found in the Constitution, the idea of a woman is not found in Alitos draft. There is only the wombthe generic vessel outside of which the fetus cannot survive. 

Alito, like many conservatives, ignores the human carrying the fetus, ignores the way it was conceived (one in five women in the United States experienced completed or attempted rape during their lifetime), ignores the dangers in carrying it to term (the maternal mortality rate for 2020 was 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births in America; only Colombia, Latvia, Mexico, and Costa Rica have a higher maternal death rate), and ignore the difficulties after birthfor the woman (America is the only industrialized nation without mandated paid maternity leave) and the child (11.6 mil­lion chil­dren, or 16% of all kids nation­wide, were liv­ing in pover­ty in 2020).

As [described](https://scholarship.law.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&amp;context=lawineq) by Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1988, the Constitution is a document of governance for and by white, propertied adult males. Reading Alitos draft opinion, it is hard to imagine that the conservative majority aims to do anything but return our society to this original state of being.","Keep_Track",3040,3040,0,0.96,6,0,3,191

She had fertility problems and we decided on a surrogate, who was a distant friend of ours. We agreed itd be a traditional surrogate mom, as in shes the biological mother since we couldnt use my ex wifes eggs, and wed used my sperm via IUI. She was very open to help us and then our son was born. We agreed she could have a small role in his life as a fun aunt we would see every so often but legally he was my exs child. 

My ex realized it wasnt how she thought it would be. It became pretty evident she didnt connect with him and because of that she wasnt as involved. We did therapy, we tried to figure out how to make things work. All of it didnt do anything. First she wanted to take a break from us to figure out what she wants. Then came wanting a divorce except she didnt want custody. Just to have visitation. 

Months of going after her for child support or pushing her to come see her child. She stopped taking my calls. I accepted that Id be raising my kid on my own. 

His (biological) mom spent more time with him. I wanted that so hed at least have some sort of maternal figure in his life with my ex out. 2 years later we fell in love and started dating. Another 3 years we got married. We decided shed adopt him through step parent adoption. It was a headache going through the legal process since she was the surrogate mother and signed off on her parental rights. With my consent and then proving my ex abandoned him, we were able to terminate my exs rights so his mom can adopt him. 

All this time later (my son is 7 now), my ex came back asking to spend time with him now. My wife and I wont let her. One because shes been out so long so he doesnt know her. The other was her reaction after telling her no. She started telling everyone she left because I had an affair with my now wife and thats how she got pregnant with our son. 

For 3 months it was this whole headache because some family actually believed her. My wife is pregnant with our 2nd child so you can imagine that took a toll on her. She came to our house once apologizing but she just wants to see her son after missing out on so much time. I asked her to leave several times until we got police involved but it made it worse and she ended up arrested for trespassing. 

My ex MIL (whos still somewhat involved in his life) was so angry because she had to bail my ex out. She told me my ex is obviously hurting over her mistake and I just made everything worse instead of being compassionate enough to de-escalate the situation by talking to her. Not only did I hurt my ex more she says, but also just hurt her chances of stability with an arrest on her record. 

She wasnt a big supporter when I got with my sons biological mom and shes my exs mom after all so Im not sure if I really was TA or shes more biased here. AITA?","AmItheAsshole",2984,2984,0,0.97,2,0,0,287

His parents and all his siblings died in the camps and he was the sole survivor from our family. The camps were liberated when he was only 10, but he still remembers the horror of it. 

His wife, my grandmother, sadly passed away young and my Dad is their only child. My parents had some fertility problems and as a result I am an only child. This means that I have no cousins or siblings (or even second cousins) that share my surname. 

It came up in conversation recently that Im CF and am not planning to ever have kids, and he looked so sad that it nearly broke me. 

His eyes filled with tears and he said:
I would never tell you what to do, and you must do whatever makes you happy. It just makes me sad that my parents went through so much to protect me and help me survive, only for our family line to die out anyway just 2 generations later

I havent been able to stop thinking about it since. It keeps me up at night. The trauma that he went through, that the whole family went through, is abhorrent. A part of me feels like having children is the right thing to do, to honor his survival and make sure that his story and his family lives on. But I still dont actually WANT children.
And I feel horrifically guilty.

Mood spoiler: First update is &gt;!semi-hopeful!&lt;, second update is &gt;!absolutely infuriating!&lt;

[First letter](https://www.askamanager.org/2020/06/my-disgusting-boss-touches-and-chews-on-everything-on-my-desk.html)

My boss, who is a lawyer, is of the opinion that everything on my desk and in my office is his and completely fair game. It doesnt matter if I bought it, brought it from home, or that I dont want germs spread around the office  he thinks he can touch and use EVERYTHING.

Because of COVID-19 (and, really, even before that), I have asked him repeatedly to not use my desk and the things on it. He says hell stop but he doesnt. Ive found chewed pens, chewed food, and spilled drinks on my desk. It happens daily. This is a man whose wife covers all the furniture in their house because he is such a slob. Its just gross.

He told me yesterday that because his hands are dry and because of arthritis, he actually licks his fingers so he can keep a grip on his pen (!!). He also puts work papers in his mouth, and they have bite marks on them. Ewww!

I have certain types of pens on my desk that I bought and can tell the writing apart from his ink pen, and I have noticed he uses them (I sanitized them and everything else).

He has his own office and supplies, so Im not sure why he does this, other than my desk is exponentially cleaner than his. I have taken all my supplies off my desk and kept them in my car before so he wont touch them, have left huge notes on legal size file folders asking that my desk not be used, covered my desk, shut my door  nothing works!

Most of these bad habits are just that  habits. Im not sure he can even stop doing any of these things. Hes the owner so there is no one above him or an HR to go to. Short of setting mouse traps, Im not sure how to get the point across that these behaviors are just gross and show a great lack of respect for anyone else in the office. Any advice?

[Update #1](https://www.askamanager.org/2020/12/update-my-disgusting-boss-touches-and-chews-on-everything-on-my-desk.html)

I wish I could say he stopped touching everything on my desk but I cant  he still does it. He has no regard for anyones personal space and firmly believes that if its in his office it belongs to him.

What I have done is what some of your readers suggested and greatly minimized what he touches. I have moved all of my pens, markers, stapler, everything somewhere else. I leave nothing on my desk when I go home. The stapler goes home with me and my pen holder is now a Clorox wipes tub that sits with the other cleaning supplies in my office. There is absolutely no danger of him going in that! Lol!

I have learned that my boss is simply one of those people who will run you over if you let him. I dont let him. Im never disrespectful but do let him know in very specific terms that some behavior is not okay (like putting my pens and paper he gives in his mouth!) and that I will go home if he doesnt cut it out. That usually works. I am paid well here and my hours are prime, so Im not leaving. Its just a matter of getting through to him that he cant act any kind of gross way he wants to just because hes the boss. It will continue to be that proverbial work in progress. Thank you and your readers for all the suggestions!

[Update #2; its number 3 at the link](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/01/updates-the-micromanagement-the-fertility-treatments-and-more.html)

As an update to my update&my boss has probably given me COVID. =! He came to work very sick on Monday (and probably over Christmas break while I was gone). I was in the office long enough to hear how sick he was and left immediately. It still didnt help because Im sure he was in there touching everything. 

I suddenly lost my sense of smell yesterday, so got tested today. Unbelievable!

Id like to add a message to employers as well. Please stay home if youre sick! It doesnt matter what you have, just stay home! And if your employees are sick, make them go home until theyre better.

TL;DR at the bottom. Am on phone etc etc

I honestly think this is still very funny but Im in a lot of trouble. My husband and I have been trying for a baby. It hasnt been working out. We havent gone to a doctor or anything yet, but things have been disappointing. As a result, baby making time can SOMETIMES feel a little like a chore. Not that we arent attracted to each other or anything. Its just that checking my ovulation and planning out ~special time~ means that Im not always feeling totally into it. So obviously, the bedroom can have different vibes, and today I was in a silly goofy mood. I had reached a point where the big event wasnt going to happen for me (Im trying to keep this as PG as possible lol). But, I always say that its a lot like pizza. Even if you have bad pizza, youre still happy to have pizza! Anyways, when my husband was ready to deliver the goods, if you will, I had a thought pop into my head. And that thought was of Sam at the top of the stairs leading to Mordor in Return of the King. He offers to help Frodo by taking the ring. So basically, right as my husband reached the finale this morning, I laugh and say Share the load! Like I do a weird accent and everything.  Im still laughing!!! It was a funny joke! He was very unhappy with the timing of that quote and left to work out without talking to me. He texted me later telling me how weird it was to say that, I was disrespectful, its just not the right moment. I concede all of those points, it was a mistake. But, I didnt mean to make him feel weird, I just wanted to lighten the mood!


TL;DR I shout Share the load! (From LOTR) at the same moment my husband is about to try to impregnable me. Hes not talking to me and wants to take some time off trying for a baby.


Edit: I really thought only like 10 people would see this and think it was funny. Thank you for the awards and comments. There are some very very funny jokes and gifs in the comment thread. I wont reply to probably anyone, but husband and I talked it out and we are laughing about the whole situation. I think we will take some time off trying for now, but if this was THE one I will definitely have to pick out a shire name for the kid right? Thank you for those that shared their fertility journeys as well, it was nice to hear that we arent alone.","tifu",2928,2928,0,0.95,4,0,2,336

When you refuse to take responsibility, others will force you to do it - and you won't like it



When you refuse to take responsibility, others will force you to do it - and you won't like it


This is my first post and it is a long one so settle in - it's story time.



The cast (not their real names):


Jackie - foster mom - good person and neighbor


Tom - Foster dad, hubby to foster mom, he and I are brother from different mothers.


Baby Mama = mom to Chuck and Baby


Archie - Baby daddy and father to Chuck


Chuck - older child of Baby Mama


Baby - newborn of Baby Mama


Lisa - Baby Mama's younger sister and the first foster kid to be placed in Jackie and Tom's home



The story -


This all started when my neighbors across the street, Jackie and Tom, wanted kids and found out they couldn't due to medical reasons. I won't go into that however they did decide to be foster parents. Now in describing Jackie and Tom - they are the nicest people you would ever want to meet. Both would help anyone, give the shirt off their backs, and try to see the good in people. They bought the house they live in now so that they could raise a family. Seeing how they could not have kids of their own, they thought they could help other kids have a better life.


The first child to come stay with them is 11 year old Lisa. She came from a troubled home - well to put it more simply a trailer with no electricity and no running water. It was a real bad situation. Lisa was failing at school and running wild. In a short time Jackie and Tom had her enrolled in the local middle school, set ground rules and worked closely with her on everything. It was amazing the turnaround that happened at first. However... bad things started to happen. Lisa's parents kept trying to get her home and being the delinquent parents they were, it was nothing but trouble. I'm getting sidetracked here so let me get back on track.


Soon after this Chuck was placed in the care of Jackie &amp; Tom. Chuck was a drug baby in that Baby Mama was on drugs while pregnant. So this arrangement was in place for a few months - Lisa in school and Chuck being raised by Jackie &amp; Tom. It was at this point Baby Mama can to live with Jackie &amp; Tom due to a domestic violence issue.


Let me start with Baby Mama on my first impression was - how do I say this - set off my danger alarm. You know that feeling you get around meeting someone and you just know in the back of your head they are trying to play you from the word go and make it look like they are just being friendly? That is the best as I can describe it. I knew I needed to keep my distance and not to get involved in her drama. Oh and I need to say here she was pregnant.


Jackie &amp; Tom really try hard to help Baby Mama out. Free place to stay, free food, and few rules. They even helped her get a car. At first things are going well.....then....things started to go down hill. Arguments would happen, Baby Mama was acting strange, and Archie was causing problems. Archie - that is Chuck's dad and the git who knocked up Baby Mama again. Archie was also the reason Baby Mama came to live with Jackie &amp; Tom. Apparently Archie was abusive to Baby Mama ended up having a restraining order against him. Anyway Archie would be talking to Baby Mama on the phone all the time and at the time it was thought Archie was gas lighting Baby Mama. How wrong that thought was...(I'm getting ahead of myself here)


In May Baby Mama gave birth to Baby. At this time Jackie &amp; Tom are making sure all the doctor appointments are done and proper care is provided. Baby Mama - how do I say this - is acting a bit strange. To put it simply - there are times where she is acting like the lights are on but nobody is home. Jackie &amp; Tom are clueless on what this is. I personally witnessed one incident where Chuck (who is 20 months old at the time and walking) got out of the house and I found him in the street. By himself. Now we live in a cul-de-sac and the area is really quiet so nothing bad happened yet where was Baby Mama? She was down the street talking on her cell phone to Archie. I take Chuck and knock on the door to let Jackie know Chuck got outside. Jackie tells me Baby Mama was supposed to be watching him while she was bathing Baby. When Baby Mama comes back up the street I simply look at her and say ""You f-ed up. Chuck was in the street just now."" Baby Mama screams ""Lisa was supposed to be watching him!"" and runs inside. Well - there was a problem with that. Lisa was not home from school yet. (face palm)


In June there is a huge argument and Baby Mama moves out. She does a stealth move and takes Chuck and baby with her. Here is the kicker - she didn't tell Jackie &amp; Tom she was going to do this. Just to put this into context - Chuck was taken away from her in the first place by child services due to her bad parenting. So as you can guess - the cops got involved and 3 weeks later Baby Mama was forced to return the children to Jackie &amp; Tom. When the children were returned they were in the same clothes, both bleeding from diaper rash, and I kid you not - lost a 1/5 of their total body weight. Baby left weighing 15 lbs and came back at 12 lbs. Jackie took both children to the pediatrician and to her horror both kids were basically starved. There are two police officers present during this exchange and one of them is horrified at what she sees. Remember this officer for she comes back later in the story.


Now at this point Jackie &amp; Tom have had enough of Baby Mama's antics and tells her in no uncertain words she is to come get her stuff. Does she do it? Nope. She was given 30 days too. So, Tom does some spring cleaning and all the stuff goes to the dump. I ended up with a guitar that is now being restored as well as a musical keyboard. Now you would think this would be the end of it. Not even close. In late August Jackie &amp; Tom get served with a court notice Baby Mama and Archie are petitioning the court to get custody of the kids. I get asked to testify at the hearing for what I witnessed with Chuck in the street. Now I'm thinking at this time No F-ing Way Baby Mama can get her kids back.


On the day of court (Its early December by now) I had told my boss it should take maybe an hour or so and I will have to work remote that day. The hearing was scheduled at 9am and I'm thinking I would be back at work in a short bit.


I was so wrong on this.


We were in court from 9 am until 4:30 pm. During this hearing the judge orders both Archie and Baby Mama to have a drug test to be administered while we recess for lunch. Somehow Baby Mama passes the test. Archie gets past it also but the guy who conducted the test testifies the sample provided was cold. We ALL knew Archie fakes the test yet the judge could not prove it. I was stunned yet I had to look at it from a legal view - you have to prove he faked it. If you can't prove it, nada, nope, no $200. The judge then decides to order Archie to take a hair drug test - for those of you who don't know what this is - it is a test where they take a sample of hair from your head and test for drugs. You can't fake that test. Jackie &amp; Tom even volunteer to pay the bill for the test which the judge is more than happy to agree to. That comes in real handy later in this story


At the end of the hearing the judge rules both Baby Mama and Archie will be granted visitation each Saturday and Sunday, 3 to 6 PM at Jackie &amp; Tom's house. In the judge's ruling there is a very high bar on removing the kids from a parent and her hands were tied on this. Lets just say Jackie &amp; Tom were not thrilled by this arrangement at all.


On the first Saturday of visitation things got ugly. Cops showed up, and I'm having to sit on my front porch filming with my phone while holding my pistol in my lap. I knew Archie was a convicted criminal who did a stint for armed robbery and was known to carry around large knives on his person. I wanted to make sure he didn't try to get cute with Tom if things got out of hand. I think me being on the porch saved Tom from being in a physical altercation with Archie.


On Sunday they show up and things go more smoothly. Here is the thing - after 20 minutes of being there BOTH Archie and Baby Mama pass out on the couch for about an hour while holding the kids. Tom described it to me as Archie was talking and just then stopped and passed out. Jackie was able to take a picture. I edited out the faces but it was just so odd both of them doing this so I thought I include this in.


https://i.imgur.com/hAs3ROZ.jpg


During the following week I'm talking to Jackie &amp; Tom and they are highly concerned that they will lose the kids knowing the bar is really high on getting kids taken away from a parent. So - I start formulating a plan. Jackie tells me Baby Mama has a warrant out for her arrest in Richmond and I know that finding Baby Mama most of the time is about impossible. However - I know where she will be and when so this is where the revenge comes in. So far these two have cost me a day's pay, going to cost me a second day's pay for when we go to court again and they harmed two children. Now comes time to pay the piper.


I call the local police department and advise them of the outstanding warrant on Baby Mama, and where exactly she will be and when. When I speak to the officer - and as my luck would have it - its the same officer who was there during the exchange where Jackie &amp; Tom got the kids back from Baby Mama. She knows exactly who I'm talking about and is really interested in catching Baby Mama. I also tell the officer of Archie and what to expect with the both of them. At that point Jackie got the drug test back and what do you know - Archie is a walking drug store. I took the time and texted the results of that test to the officer I was speaking to. Here are the results from that test.


https://i.imgur.com/hxqNRUX.jpg


On that Saturday at 3pm I'm at my vacation home so I don't get to witness what happens but I get the 411 from Jackie afterwords. The cops cordon off the neighborhood and then come to Jackie &amp; Tom's house to get Baby Mama. Baby Mama finds out the cops are there and runs out the back door and into the woods. She gets away however from that point forward she never shows up again to visit her kids. Archie is only worried about her purse during all this (for their drugs were in it we find out later)


After a couple more weeks Archie stops showing up to see the kids. This drives Jackie &amp; Tom crazy for they have to put their lives on hold each weekend just in case if Archie or Baby Mama shows up during the visitation time. Well, after 6 weeks we are in court again. Jackie &amp; Tom had to subpoena the landlord of a house Baby Mama and Archie claimed they rented from and the landlord had never heard of them. To top it off Baby Mama is 3 hours late. When Baby Mama finally shows up she is right off the bat put in handcuffs. The judge at this point is really pissed off at both Archie and Baby Mama and says this: ""you're [Baby Mama] going to jail and you [Archie] are so full of drugs that I'm surprised you are able to stand. You have done nothing but lie to the court, you have harmed two children repetitively, and both of them have permanent damage from the drugs you took while you were pregnant with them. I'm ordering that full custody be granted to Jackie &amp; Tom and all rights and visitation be removed from Archie and Baby Mama.""


Here is the oddest thing - Baby Mama didn't even get upset after this was said. WTF?


So, Baby Mama went to jail for several crimes, Archie just dropped off the radar and now the two kids are in a good home with good parents. Jackie &amp; Tom are now looking to adopted both kids and even change their names.


Looking back on this it is clear that both Baby Mama and Archie are sociopaths and their only interest in the kids was the government check it gave them. Archie was also not upset at all. From a parent point of view -this is just beyond creepy.


Several months later - To this day Chuck has never spoken a word. We suspect Baby will have the same problem. They are both being sent to specialist to address their needs and I'm sure Jackie &amp; Tomas will be great parents. I just got a pic of Chuck sleeping next to Tom. In Chuck and Baby's minds - Jackie and Tom are their parents. I'm thrilled that they were saved from those two horrible people. And the best part about all this - the ONLY way now that Baby Mama or Archie can get to even see the kids again is they have to prove they are fit parents. And we all know that will NEVER happen for it involves them having to prove to the courts they are. When you fail to take responsibility - others will do it for you and the result is ALWAYS unpleasant.


I'll update this if anymore antics from Archie or Baby Mama happens.

Thank you everyone for the kind words concerning Chuck and Baby. I thought I give an update on how my ProRevenge worked out.


Tom helped me take my car last night to a shop to drop off for repairs. When driving back to the house he fills me in on what is now happening with Archie and Baby Mama


Archie has been busted with schedule 1 controlled substances. He is also in year 3 of a 5 year probation period. Apparently he was dealing out of a camper and the cops were not pleased with him. He is looking at 10 years in prison along with the 5 years of probation being tacked on as prison time. Ouch!


Baby Mama is in jail again in Richmond city and nobody will bail her out. Apparently her drug lifestyle along with her failure to appear in court multiple times got the police very upset. From what I'm told with all the charges she is facing she is looking at a couple of years in jail.


With that being said the adoption process will kick off in August. Once done Tom and Jackie will be parents of the two kids and the druggy bio parents are no longer in the picture.


I'm also happy to report Chuck is now talking. He was also tested and thankfully has been found he has no brain damage as far as they can tell. We still don't yet know about Baby's brain and if she was harmed with Baby Mama's drug use.


&gt;What happened to the girl? Lisa? She seems to have just stopped existing half way through that first post and you dont mention her here either?

She moved out of Tom's house and went to live with a lesbian couple who did foster care. I thought I put that in.

I'm happy to report Chuck is now in school and the adoption for both Chuck and Baby are done. New names for the both of them, new SSNs, and they finally have health insurance covered through Tom's work. Chuck has been going to speech therapy, and can now speak well. Baby appears to not have suffered brain damage even though Baby mamma was doing drugs when pregnant with her.


Most evenings now after the kids get home from school all the neighbors and kids come outside and the kids will play together. There have been several families that all have kids so it has been great seeing them all playing &amp; growing up together.


Last thing is I found out yesterday Archie O.D. and is now pushing up grass at the local grave yard. Baby Mamma is in jail for a several year term the last I have heard.

I never want to be pregnant again but husband is hard against me getting my tubes tied.

My husband wasnt religious at least to this extent when we first got together so it wasnt like I knew this would be my life for pretext. 

Over the years especially since his mother died he and his father have become oddly religious. One day I was watching that bringing up bates show of the people with 19 kids because nothing else was on and now he thinks its gods will how many children we have and is even against birth control. 

I got approved to get my tubes tied but now have to tell my Dr nevermind because outside of this issue, we have an amazing relationship and dont want to let my husband go. 

Im 26 and will be having my fourth child in 3 weeks. I get cholestasis of pregnancy every time Im pregnant and deal with terrible itching. Like your blood itches and nothing will help it. My back hurts, my hips feel like theyre going to break. Im miserable. My children are my whole world but Im constantly overwhelmed. I cant work because whos going to watch 4 kids? I wish I could have a job, I miss working and interacting with people besides my kids husband or occasionally my mom and brother. 


My kids are 5, 3, 14 months, and in 3 weeks Ill have another newborn. My husband now would have 19 kids himself if god permitted it. He does everything his dad says and its exhausting. I wish his dad didnt become religious. 

I want my tubes tied so bad and know its ultimately my choice but dont want to deal with the resentment. So today I brought up getting an IUD. My husband said if you want to thats your choice. Then added but have fun with your abortions. Under his logic wouldnt a period be an abortion? I just cant. Im so miserable. 

I feel like I cant be a good mom and Im always yelling because my kids dont listen to me, Im constantly touched out and over stimulated. I just want to be a better mother but how can I when Im constantly sleep deprived and taking care of a newborn? 

My body hurts so bad I cant sleep at night. I couldnt imagine going through this as many times as god allows Im very fertile and would be pregnant every single year. I know Ill just get told to leave my husband but thats not an option for me. I just need to vent because I feel so alone right now.


EDIT : I think Im going to get on birth control. And will be having a serious talk with him about MY mental needs and concerns. I just cant do this. Maybe 1 more kid years down the road but I do not want my entire life to be motherhood and at this point I down right refuse. I agree with him that a tubal is a huge decision and I honestly probably would regret it as I could see myself wanting one more when my current children are older and I have a clear head. But I cant and wont have more for the foreseeable future. I think Ill also be having a talk with him about his selfishness and how he sees how badly I itch all day from my liver condition and how much my body hurts from this pregnancy and get it thru his thick skull that maybe Im hurting so bad because i my body has gone through 4 pregnancies in 5 years. My oldest just turned 5 in May.  If he doesnt listen, I will be taking my youngest to stay at my moms for the weekend and leave him to deal with the older two to get a taste of what I go through on a daily basis.


EDIT #2 Im going to sit him down tonight and tell him he can either give me love and compassion. And deal with the fact that I WILL be getting on birth control after this child or I will be going to my moms and contacting a lawyer. Im done with the manipulation that I have been blind to and hes either going to give me the respect and consideration I deserve or he can get used to the idea of seeing his kids every other weekend.","Marriage",2925,2925,0,0.87,2,0,0,612

I'm 36 year old female struggling with fertility for years and was never able to have children. My husband and I tried everything, even adoption but our finances got damaged in 2020 and adoption is no longer within reach.

I've made peace with this loss (loss of hopes and dreams of being a mom) and have began a new chapter where I focus on what's ahead and keep my mental health intact.

I have a cousin ""Megan"" she's 38, married with 3 kids and always (almost every time she sees me) brings my infertility and talk about stuff I missed out on being a mom. It stressed me out back then but it now serves as a hurtful reminder of what could've been. She'd now talk about my ""hypothatical children"" (she even gave them names) and what they woupd've done/what grade they'd be in by now. My mom told her to stop it as it's become too much but she said she was doing this to cheer me up and lift up my spirit. trust me, it does the opposite.


I was invited to BBQ by my family and Megan was there with her husband. Mom, dad, aunt and other cousins were there. We were eating while the kids were playing with the ball. Megan sighed and then turned to me and said that if I had children they'd be here with us and doing this and that that very day. I stopped eating and looked at her in desbelief. Her husband smirked and said ""yeah, Little Timmy would be running with the ball from all the other kids right now"". I was so hurt and upset I snapped. I looked at Megan and her husband and said ""what do you keep talking about my ""hypothetical"" children?, are you tired of talking about yours?"". Megan looked shocked, her husband said ""hey, that was totally uncalled for!"" We had an argument and mom and aunt got involved. Megan pitched a fit saying I was being deliberately disrespectful and offended her and her family with what I said. My mom told me to apologize because it was clearly a misunderstanding, I pointed out how Megan has been doing this for some God awful reason knowing how I felt about it yet still kept doing it. She started crying and I went home.

I told my husband and he cried. Mom called me saying making a scene at the family BBQ was over the line and said that Megan and her husband AND aunt are upset because they think I snapped at them for no reason. She said I had to apologize and let it go but I refused.","AmItheAsshole",2841,2841,0,0.97,2,0,1,357

Im 39f my husband is 39m. Weve been married for 13 years. After struggling with infertility for a few years we realized early in our marriage we would not be able to have kids of our own. It was a tough realization but we both decided to dedicate ourselves to our jobs and spoil the nieces and nephews and young cousins we have.



A few months ago a young woman, Kaylee, 26f, moved into the house next door to us. She has two twin sons, and is recently widowed. Shes lovely and completely overwhelmed. She has no family in the area so my husband and I of course offered to help her with anything she needed. Shell come to us for help with little things-shell ask my husband to fix something or ask for an ingredient for a meal, along those lines.



My husband is always respectful and I dont think he would ever cheat. But I see how he reacts whenever Kaylee calls or rings the bell. His eyes light up, he gets excited. He loves her twin boys, they play and roughhouse with him all the time. Our driveway runs along the side of her yard. When he used to come home from work and they would be outside hed take a few minutes to play with them before he came in. So now theyre out there every afternoon waiting for him. My husband has admitted seeing them run up to him after work brightens up good whole day.



I know my husband would never cheat or betray me. But I see him loosing himself in this fantasy of what if this was my family. What if these were my kids. I know he wouldnt cheat but I have this fear hes going to realize what we have isnt enough and hes going to leave me for the ready made family next door.



I dont want to discuss these concerns with him and  sound accusatory? But yesterday I saw him and Kaylee talking outside and I wanted to cry. They looked like a happy family. They were on her deck talking and laughing. He was holding one twin boy while the other was climbing on her. I feel like Im loosing my husband I theres nothing I can do to stop it. I dont know what to do.

**edit** I am also friends with her. We also hang out. Just because I am also friends with her, doesnt mean that it is not hurtful to see how happy and excited my husband gets to see her and her family.

**edit 2** just because I am on here looking for advice on how to say this without sounding accusatory to my husband, does not mean I am not willing to have a conversation with him. I dont always know the right to say or the right way to say things.


**edit 3** thank you to everybody who is encouraging me to try fertility treatments, IVF, adoption, or fostering. I know your intentions are probably well-meaning. However, my husband have tried everything, exhausted every resource to have a family. I am not going to go into the years, and years of shots, treatments, injections, and close to $100,000 of our savings that we spent trying to start a family. The heartbreak that came with every unsuccessful treatment, every miscarriage, is unable to be put into words. We did try adoption. The adoption fell through last minute. After we had a whole room set up. We were so excited and it ended in heartbreak. We also fostered and it ended in a similarly heartbreaking fashion. I would really prefer not to discuss it past that.



**Final edit** Ive received so many helpful comments that have really given me a lot of perspective on what to say to my husband. Im coming up with what Im going to say now, and Im going to have a conversation with him when he comes home from work tonight. I am very thankful to everybody who took the time out of their day to give me advice. I am autistic, so it is not always easy to know exactly what to say in the situation so it does not come out  wrong. I am very thankful that I got some outsider perspective on here, it really made me understand the core problems of what was bothering me, and what I dont need to focus on.

Thank you all very much. Im sure the conversation is going to be a productive and constructive one thanks to the advice and perspective Ive gotten here. Have a wonderful day!","relationship_advice",2768,2768,0,0.97,3,0,1,197

What even is Sumeru's cultural identity????","Short answer: Sumeru's character design philosophy is inspired primarily by Egyptian and Persio fashion, but the lore (on the forest side) is primarily inspired mostly by Zoroastrianism, a religion practiced in Persia and India, with some small sprinklings of Buddhism. Does Nahida's design have cultural elements? No. Does her lore have cultural elements? Yes.

In Zoroastrianism, there is one god named 'Ahura Mazda', creator of the universe and sustainer of the cosmic order. There is also the concept of 'yazatas', epithets relating to divine figures. These yazatas can encompass a wide variety of concepts: primordial creatures, spirits, plants and even prayers. Ahura Mazda is the ""greatest of the yazatas"" and there are lesser yazatas after him. One of these is Sraosha, who I believe Nahida is based on.

Sraosha is Ahura Mazda's messenger and the embodiment of his divine word. He is the yazata of ""conscience"" and ""observance. Ahura Mazda often sends him to combat the demons that harass men. One of these demons is 'Ahriman', the primary antagonist of Zoroastrianism, and in the Persian text 'Shahnameh', Sraosha is cited to have taken the form of a 'peri' in order to warn men of the threats posed by Ahriman. Now what are 'peris'? Peris are cited to be the origin of the western concept of ""fairies"", and is primarily a Persian concept. They are fairies, just like how Nahida looks like a forest fairy.

&amp;#x200B;

[traditional depiction of a peri](https://preview.redd.it/gi9z766ireq91.png?width=529&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=520fcb9848874ee22dddb4f007810ddef188fa4e)

As you can see so obviously, Nahida, albeit also a fairy, does not look anything like the Persian peri. Nilou also falls victim to this, looking like an Egyptian belly dancer design-wise even though her dance is inspired by Persian traditions. Traditional depictions of the Peri's attire and traditional Persian clothing align on the same wavelength and are both comprised of long colorful robes (no midriff), but Nahida and Nilou's designs don't look like traditional Persian fashion.

&amp;#x200B;

[Nilou's design inspiration vs dance inspiration](https://preview.redd.it/obvm00tdseq91.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5d7e965898c1529e37a389bedb69be1919974e0f)

The only Persian-looking element of Nilou's design are her horns and tattoos

[Persian women clothing and water lily symbols during the Sassanian period,](https://preview.redd.it/7qzbvnxgseq91.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f497bf942de900981079eab78b216e3bb0760a8d)

A lot point out that Kusanali is a sanskrit amalgamation of the words ""kusa"" (kusa-grass), and ""nali"" (a hollow stalk), and that she herself may be a reference to the Kusanali Jataka tale, which would imply that she is either Buddha (since the Jataka tales are a collection of texts that detail Buddha's different births), or the Bodhisata fairy (Bodhisatta means a person on the path to awakening or 'boddhi', or buddhahood. The bodhi tree is similarly known as the tree of awakening, which is in line with Nahida's enlightened god of wisdom stature). However, Kusanali does not look like Buddha or the Bodhisatta.

&amp;#x200B;

[The Bodhisatta is the tree dweller in the picture](https://preview.redd.it/atqh068l1fq91.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6c95b9de56237d9fc785b262223618063b19fef8)

However, the lore surrounding Nahida takes heavily from Zoroastrianism. One of the books found in Sumeru, ""The Folio of Foliage"", have very interesting passages that reference zoroastrianism.

*"" But this land remained broken, its heart devoured by evil spirits and monsters who made it their dwelling  a cavern of the damned where neither sun, moon, nor fire shine ""*

*"" She stepped alone to that emptied earthly heart and softly touched its timeless face, becoming the immortal* ***Gaokerena*** *and the earth itself.  The songs of a hundred birds surrounded her, praising the life that she had at last reclaimed, like a mortal trading their old clothes for fresh ones, casting off their original shackles, and ascending to the eternal temple. ""*

The text implies that shortly after the cataclysm happened in Khaenriah, in order to replenish life where life has withered, Rukkhadevata became the 'gaokerena'. In zoroastrian/persian legends, the gaokerena was a mythical plant that had healing properties when eating and bestowed immortality to resurrected bodies of the dead. This is heavily attributed to the biblical/Islamic Tree of Life, and in Genshin, is heavily theorized to be the Irminsul, which Rukkhadevata has been heavily theorized to have become a part of. Furthermore, Ahriman once sent a frog to invade and destroy the tree. Ahura Mazda in turn, sent two kar fish staring at the frog to guard. The zoroastrianismic references continue.

Back to Nahida and Sraosha. In Persian legends, Sraosha is one of the three guardians of **Chinvat Bridge**, a sifting bridge that separates the living realm from the dead realm. Upon death, all souls must cross the bridge, where they are judged by Sraosha. The path will narrow to those souls that have led wicked lives, and a demon named  Chinnaphapast will bring them to Druj-Demana, the house of Lies. Those who have led righteous lives will instead be escorted to the House of **Daena, the house of insight and revelation.**

Now where have we heard Daena and Chinvat Bridge before? We know in game that Chinvat Ravine is a narrow gorge that leads to Sumeru City, where Sumeru Academia is. Furthermore, we know that the House of Daena is the library in Sumeru Academia. Nahida guards Sumeru Academia, and the entirety of Sumeru as a whole, the same way Sraosha guards the realm of enlightenment. The analogies are pretty clear at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Sraosha is also known as Saraswati outside of zoroastrianism. Saraswati fights off the female demon ""Drug"", and serves as the embodiment of Gautama Buddha's teachings, upholding it by offering protection to its practitioners. However, you may also more commonly know Saraswati as 'Anahita'. You may also know Vahid, the Sumerian seller of fertilizer in Ritou who says, "" Enjoy the blessing of Lesser Lord Kusanali! **Anahitian** Blessing now 10% off! "". Both Anahitian and Nahida could be references to Anahita/Saraswati.

Finally, the last zoroastrianism reference - Deevs. Daeva/Deevs are zoroastrian entities who promote chaos and disorder. Collei stans may be well familiar with this term after having the read the manga.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/anqmn5fjxeq91.jpg?width=550&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e750fc2051ec9c689b1dfaea6aea126a60d42e

Enough about Nahida and Zoroastrianism. Do other Sumeru characters have cultural elements? Yes. Do they embody one consistent cultural identity? It's complicated. Let's start off with Tighnari. Tighnari has strong Kabyle and Morrocan inspirations. He wears an Agus belt, djellaba hoodie, and aserwal.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q2zvtzpbzeq91.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=412c728136a74abffbcffad4f7ab778c407e43bf

Dehya's attire is inspired by Ayutthaya era traditional clothing in Thailand, and her chest cloth is inspired by Tabengman, a specific style of chest covering where fabric is wrapped around the chest like an ""X""

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6bbdbare0fq91.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5edceba38640597b62746618d76070c3b6c1d480

I don't need to include Cyno and Candace here, since they already have overt Egyptian theming, and their cultural references are as such, not as obscure. Moreover, I didn't include what possible cultural affiliations the desert characters and areas may be tied to since the word Deshret and the overall culture of the desert seems to be more Egyptian and less Persian.

Ultimately, I think the problem with Sumeru designs is not that it doesn't have cultural elements, or that they don't look great (which isn't true), but that it is having a cultural identity crisis. There are people who are mad that Dehya looks sexualized, in comparison to Dihya, the Berber military queen who led an indigenous resistance against Muslim invaders of the Ummaya dynasty. However, her design looks very Thai. This cultural mixup ends up creating a very confusing cultural confusion. I think it would've been better if they narrowed down Sumeru's inspiration to Egypt and Persia, instead of SWANA and SEA. Inazuma is only Japan, Liyue is only China and Mondstadt is only Germany. Why is Sumeru an amalgamation of like ten different countries???

[Dihya](https://preview.redd.it/4v20l50g2fq91.jpg?width=191&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6bd6aa6cbbaea3bdaf5fe2cbccb23178cb414308)

Ultimately, I think the sore thumbs of the Sumeru design roster is Dehya, Nilou and Dori. Dehya's character creates confusion because she seems to be named after an Amazigh person, but is designed like a Thai character. Nilou on the other hand, is a Persian dancer, but looks like an Egyptian belly dancer. Dori, on the other hand, is often cited to embody the orientalist ""scammer Arab"" trope, and looks like an Alladin character.

So what do you think?

# FAQ

# What does this mean?

The amount of sperm in my testicles increased while I was reading this.

# Why did you do this?

In the human reproductive process, two kinds of sex cells, or **gametes**  (GAH-meetz), are involved. The male gamete, or sperm, and the female  gamete, the egg or ovum, meet in the female's reproductive system. When  sperm fertilizes (meets) an egg, this fertilized egg is called a **zygote** (ZYE-goat). The zygote goes through a process of becoming an embryo and developing into a fetus. 

  My testicles perform the following tasks on their own:

&amp;#x200B;

* They produce, maintain and transport sperm (the male reproductive cells) and semen (the protective fluid around sperm).
* They discharge sperm into the female reproductive tract.
* They produce and secrete male sex hormones.

# What Is the Male Reproductive System?

The male has reproductive organs, or genitals, that are both inside and outside the pelvis. The male genitals include:

&amp;#x200B;

* the testicles (TESS-tih-kulz)
* the duct system, which is made up of the epididymis and the vas deferens
* the accessory glands, which include the seminal vesicles and prostate gland
* the penis

# I don't believe my comment deserved this. Can you un-produce sperm?

Sure,  mistakes happen. But I can't consciously stop producing sperm or dissolve it when it is still in my balls. But if semen is ejaculated into a female's vagina, millions of sperm ""swim""  up from the vagina through the cervix and uterus to meet the egg in the fallopian tube. It takes only one sperm to fertilize the egg. 

# How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept it and move on. But learn from this:  A male who has reached puberty will produce millions of sperm cells every day. Each sperm is extremely small: only 1/600 of an inch (0.05  millimeters long). Sperm develop in the testicles within a system of tiny tubes called the **seminiferous tubules**. At birth,  these tubules contain simple round cells. During puberty, testosterone and other hormones cause these cells to transform into sperm cells. The cells divide and change until they have a head and short tail, like tadpoles. The head contains genetic material (genes). The sperm move into the epididymis, where they complete their development.","copypasta",2733,2733,0,0.99,7,0,0,53

We're pursuing fertility treatments as a result and my wife is stressed about the cost and overall impact on our health. She says that's why she's detached and distant but for me its a noticeable change. 

She works night shift as a charge nurse. Her new manager started about a year and he has recently offered her a position as assistant manager. Huge step in her career. I asked her if there was anything funny about him and she said no. Today something felt off so when we were working out I grabbed her phone and looked through her texts. I looked at the one with her boss and she had recently picked up a shift to help because there was a call out and her boss couldn't go in because it was his kids birthday party. When she said yes to working he said ""you're an angel from heaven. I'll be forever grateful for your help"". To me this was soooo inappropriate and a fight ensued. She asked if it was a female boss I'd care and I admitted I wouldn't. She didn't see the harm in the comment and said females bosses HAVE called her an angel before for helping. I feel like her boss crossed the line and that she let him and I can't trust her to stand up for our marriage. She thinks I'm crazy. My friends are a 50/50 split on the situation. 

So AITA that I'm upset her boss called her an angel and she didn't correct him?

[**Original post from August 17, 2020 - JNMIL picked my cherries because I hadn't done it yet. I was at work.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ibghmg/jnmil_picked_my_cherries_because_i_hadnt_done_it/)

I've calmed down since, but I'll admit, I was so mad I cried that day.

We live on an acreage and my pride and joy the past several years has been putting in long-term plants. Specifically fruiting varieties, berries and long-term harvestables like a rhubarb patch and even some sunflowers. I prune my trees each season. Every tree gets a once-over a few times to deal with pests. It's meditative for me. I grew up in the city and always wanted to work towards this point. I even talk to my trees and plants and everything I grow. It helps with my depression and anxiety. Very grounding, hah!

My cherry trees were doing so so good this year! Big, beautiful crops. I had nets up. The birds were leaving them alone. No serious pests. I watered them through a huge dry period during June, where most plants were scorching. They made it through, and did so so good. I was so proud of my little trees!

I had everything ready during the week. Got my ladder. Got my buckets. Got my canning equipment out and sterilized and freezer bags ready to rock. I had planned for a whole day on Saturday to get my cherries processed, and time on Sunday too if I underestimated. Work had been hell all week. I had an anxiety attack at work from the stress. It's been rough. On Friday, I got up early, checked my cherries and was excited for the day to be over so I could get a head start on some things.

I roll into my driveway and tell my other half that I'm going to just throw together a quick supper then head out and pick some cherries.

He tells me: ""Sounds good! Mom stopped by earlier and grabbed some cherries too.""

My stomach turned into an instant knot. This was my hard work. The cherries were my reward for all of that. Of the years of tending and pruning and caring and fertilizing and love.

I go out and my nets are still on the trees, but the cherries are picked as high as I could reach. All of them. All 4 trees are naked except for the very very top. I started crying. I threw my bucket like a child with a tantrum. I was so mad. Those were my cherries. Mine!

I went inside to hubby and he asked what was wrong. I told him all my cherries were gone, that JNMIL and JNFIL had taken all of them. He immediately calls them and puts them on speaker, asking what the deal was. The response?! The reason they took ALL my damn cherries?!

""Well they were ripe and ready to be picked! Since NegBar hadn't done it yet, we assumed she just didn't want them.""

Yes, because I put up bird netting for fun. Because me having the ladder out is just me doing yard feng shui. Because having buckets on hand is just me giving the buckets some sun and fresh air.

The kicker?? The best part of all of this?!?! THEY HAVE CHERRY TREES! And apple trees. And fruit bushes! When I brought this up, they said that their cherries hadn't come in well this year. No kidding. Their trees have a fungus I've been telling them to deal with for years but they couldn't bare the thought of pruning their fruit trees!

So, they took my cherries as a result.

JNMIL had already frozen the majority of the cherries, given some away to friends. and turned the rest into various canning recipes.

I picked what I could and ended up with a single ice cream pail worth of cherries total from my four trees.

Words can't explain how absolutely gutted I am. I cried again on Saturday as I put away all my canning stuff, realizing I wouldn't need it for the amount of cherries I managed to get.

I don't think I've ever been this mad before. JNMIL has had moments in the past that I could deal with. That I've worked through. That I can almost forgive her for. Or at least pity her for, to be so desperate for certain attention or affection from people.

Even just typing this up just makes me feel so upset. My trees are something I love, you know? I've taken care of them, tended to them, talked to them, and was so excited for this year to have that moment of picking a beautiful harvest that I worked so hard for, despite depression and anxiety telling me I wasn't a gardener, couldn't do it, that I wasn't skilled enough to have fruit trees. I proved that wrong. I had a beautiful reward waiting for me, with beautiful weekend weather, and happy cherry trees to feel pride about.

And it was taken from me.

This feels like heartbreak.

It's not even about the cherries, you know?

EDIT: To add some details, Hubby thought they were asking for a small amount, like a bowl or small bucket of cherries. You know, like normal people. They stopped by before he had to go to work to ask to pick cherries. Neither of us were home while they were picking. He texted me this morning to tell me he's going over there after work to 'deal with this' for me. I will keep you posted.

[**Update from August 18, 2020.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ic5mes/update_jnmil_picked_my_cherries_because_i_hadnt/)

I never truly imagined my post about me crying over cherries would get the massive support that it did. When I wrote it, I was so angry and upset. Livid, even. By the end of the day, after talking to so many of you, I felt so much better. You made me feel heard, validated and sane. Apparently it's okay to cry over stolen cherries! The outcry over the situation was incredible, and man, I did not expect so many people to have my back. It gave me a huge confidence boost to really deal with this situation. Thank you for all your kind words, your Hugz and the direct messages I got from people offering reassuring words and support. You all helped me move past the anger and focus on solving the problem. As such, I suppose an update is in order!

First and foremost, though, is JNMILs nickname. It was a close running between Cherry-Stealing Whore and Locust. In the end, I've opted for Locust (thanks [removed user ping]!) Because we already know that she is, in fact, a cherry-stealing whore.

Hubby did go over to his parents last night after work to talk to them, and I opted to stay home. I knew that if I went over there, it would just muddle the waters and we would both end up gaslit by Locust. When it's just them and their son, they tend to take things more seriously.

Hubby called me after a little while and asked me to come over to talk too. At first I refused. I dug my heels in a bit, then realized maybe he needs back-up and he couldn't ask for it openly, you know? Fine. I throw on some shoes and go over to the JNILs, keys in hand to show I'm not there to hang out and that I'm ready to leave at a moments notice.

Locust is nowhere to be seen. Of course not. Hubby is sitting at the kitchen table with his dad. I opted not to sit, and just leaned against the counter instead.

FIL: ""I should have called you first, NegBar. I'm sorry. I thought Locust had talked to you and that with work and you being so busy lately, that you didn't have time to harvest your trees.""

Me: ""Okay here's the problem with that: Why would I have my buckets and ladders and nets out if I wasn't going to harvest my cherries?""

FIL: ""I thought that you had asked Locust for help.""

Me: I laughed! Straight up laughed. Seriously? Seriously?! ""When have I ever asked for help, FIL? Especially from Locust. You know I'm stubborn, and independent as hell. I've never asked for help with my harvests before. You know I don't even ask for help when I'm chopping wood, or hauling rocks, or building my own greenhouse! You know I hate asking for help. And even if I did, and you guys said you would, why did you guys take everything home? Why didn't you leave anything?""

FIL: ""I brought a couple buckets back and wanted to wash and pit them for you, so you wouldn't have to. I was going to drop them off later.""

Me: ""So why did your friends end up taking buckets home, then?""

FIL: ""Not my friends! That was all Locust. I had to run some errands in town and by the time I came everything was put away or gone. I only found out she had given away some after I got back.""

Me: ""Where is Locust anyway?""

FIL: ""She needed to pick up some groceries.""

Sure.

Me: ""You know, I am still very upset about all of this. One phone call. That's all you had to do. You know Locust does this. She calls and messes things up all the time. You and I both know this!""

FIL: ""I messed up on this one. I honestly thought we were going to pick a bunch and get them back to you. That's why I was hurrying to clean up the first batch while Locust was still picking.""

Me: ""Can I get my cherries now, then?""

FIL: ""Absolutely. Take all the cherries in the freezer. They're clean, and pitted too! There's jars down there, jam I think, and maybe some other stuff. I'll grab a box and we will get you some pickles and carrots and eggs too. I'm sorry this got so messed up. I've already talked to Locust about it and this will not be happening again. I promise.""

So we loaded up my car with cherries and jams and pickled goodies. I left some of the gross jam that was super runny and a weird mixed berry thing. She can have that. Enjoy. I got some pickled eggs, spicy pickles and a couple big jars of pickled carrots.

While we were loading the car, I also mentioned my excess canning equipment. I asked FIL what he has for apples. He said he would pick whatever was ready and leave them on the deck for me to pick-up after work sometime this week. That he would give me a call and let me know when and I could come by anytime once he had a bunch for me.

Hubby also reminded his dad that we are putting in a security system on our property with remote cameras and motion sensors, something we've been wanting to do for a long time. I mentioned that I would get alerts on my phone, which would make me feel more safe while I was at work or at home when hubby wasn't there. FIL said that was a great idea, and he would make Locust well aware that she is no longer welcome to do any 'surprise visits' without us there.

I told him that even if she tried, we would know about it, and that it records everything. We would be able to go back and see if she broke this visitation rule.

I decided not to put Locust on blast on social media, mostly to be the bigger person here. Sure, her friends might think she gave them cherries. Cool. I don't care what her friends think, and it will be interesting to watch her squirm next year when she has no cherries anymore all of a sudden That's the bed she will have to lie in.

I ended up getting the majority of my cherries back, frozen, but at least they're clean and already pitted. I can make pies with these, so I'm okay with that. Plus I got some goodies that I hadn't had a chance to make yet this year, so that was a bonus. And I've negotiated several buckets worth of apples with FIL, so that my canning stuff won't go completely to waste this year.

I have decided that I will be going VVVLC with Locust for the next while (especially around any harvest time.) I have also decided that I will be blocking certain family members around harvest time next year as well, so they don't get to see what I'm growing either. Locust has shown she cannot be trusted to know anything about another person's garden.

Do I believe FIL in all of this? Yes and no. He has moments where he's OK and he has moments where he is JN. But, he has his own issues and, in the end, he did apologize, gave me back my stuff and gave me additional stuff to make up for the cherry loss of what was given away. So not an ultimate win, but I still consider that better than a total loss. I feel like once I get the apples I've been promised (and I will report back if I don't), the only thing left out of balance will be the behavior and violation of trust rather than the financial loss of the situation.

We are moving forward with the security system. We are putting them on an info diet. I have decided to not bring home-cooked meals to the family get-togethers for the foreseeable future as well. As much as I love cooking, I have my walls up and I'm still feeling super defensive. I don't want her to know what I'm growing, so I won't be bringing anything but store-bought, pre-packaged foods to dinner from now on. She doesn't get to know when my dill or chives are plentiful, my cucumbers are ready, my tomatoes are nice and juicy, my potatoes hilled, and definitely not when my fruit is ready for picking!

The funny part? I had a bucket set aside that I had planned to give her full of cherries once I was done picking myself. But, she had to go and be a cherry-stealing whore. Hope it was worth destroying the olive branches I had offered over the years! Hope she enjoys her running mixed berry jam. Hope those sad little jars were worth it, because I'll never be sharing my cherries again.

I'm a kind person, deep down. But rue the day you fuck with my trees.

[**Update from August 26, 2020.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/ih6cez/mil_called_to_apologize_and_i_invited_her_over/)

*Shoutout to /u/MakingWickedBacon for tracking this one down.*

A quick update.

So MIL reached out to me the other day to talk. Since she doesn't usually call me directly, I decided to see how it would play out. MIL apologized for her behavior, both recent and past. She seemed very awkward on the phone. We discussed what happened and some feeling stuff about it. It stayed surprisingly civil. Since the floor was open for discussion, I decided to ask MIL why she hates me, and has hated me, for all these years.

MIL said she doesn't hate me, but didn't really elaborate past that. I decided it was time to push a bit, and ended up asking her if anyone, in her eyes, would ever be good enough to marry her son?

MIL didn't open up entirely, but did admit that she had a really hard time after her kids moved out.

Yeah.. no kidding lol.

So there are definitely deeper issues to this whole thing, which we all knew. Definitely some resentment in general, which we all knew. But that's not something I can fix for her. She's gotta deal with those issues herself and learn to let the past go. The kids are long grown. They don't stay babies forever, and can't rely on their mommy for everything. She's gotta learn that. If it takes some harsh boundary lessons, then so be it.

I ended up inviting her over to do some canning. Rewarding the behavior I wanted to see, you know? She could've kept ignoring me and avoiding me, but instead she called and apologized. That's a step in the right direction. It went reasonably well. Conversation was pretty light and nothing crazy happened. We touched a little bit more in some stuff with the family. MIL didn't really open up anymore, but didn't critique me every 5 minutes either, so I'll consider that progress.

We (DH and I) are sticking to the plan of security cameras still and the info diet. If boundaries stay respected then we will evaluate how we want to handle it going forward. An apology is great and it's good to see her experiencing some remorse about everything. At least there is some self awareness there, even if it stems from bitter places deep-down. As long as she can learn to treat me civilly I'll accept that. We don't have to be buddy-buddy. She just needs to learn to stop acting this way or she'll end up pushing us all away completely.

Info diet and security cameras might help hold her accountable. Or prove that we were right to keep our walls up for a bit.

We will see.

This is a very anticlimactic outcome but I think it's important to remember the end goal in these situations. To find balance, boundaries, middle ground or a safe final solution for all parties involved. So many people offered their thoughts about this situation and 90% of them were reasonable. But those of you that sent me messages suggesting I burn down her orchard? Destroy things on her property? Even suggesting violence against her? Guys, don't become the JNs that you hate.

Bullying is so easy to transfer from one person to another. I could see the hurt in those posts and DMs. That you've gone through some terrible stuff too. Don't let the hate get inside you. Don't become what you hate. You're better than that. Don't let them destroy the goodness in you. Stand up tall, hold your boundaries and do what you need to do to keep your safety, mental and physical, from these people. You don't need to stoop to their level! Break the cycle.

MIL and I will never be friends. Too much has happened between us for that to be a reality. But if I can get her to at least be civil to me by using tools like an info diet, stricter boundaries and a security system, then I'll take that as a step towards success. Burning down her orchard wouldn't have solved anything.

In an effort to break the cycle, I'll be doing an info diet here going forward as well. I'll be keeping any MIL updates plain, simple and to the point. I think too many people here enjoy the drama, as my DMs indicated. That they are looking forward to hearing more about my MIL... and that's just an odd thing to hear. Why would you wish more drama on someone?

Thanks to those of you who were the reasonable, sane ones around here that made suggestions and were helpful. We looked at a bunch of the security systems you all recommended, and fencing, and followed the advice on the best way to put MIL on a social media info diet without blocking her completely. A few gardeners chimed in too and it was great to talk shop with like-minded people. That was all very helpful. So thank you.","BestofRedditorUpdates",5835,5835,0,0.97,1,0,0,328

I also have a 12yo brother (we'll call Ryan), and he's the reason for this conflict. When Jake was a kid, I'm not going to get into the specifics, but doctors didn't think he would make it to twelve. Jake wasn't just the baby of the family, but also the only boy. Our parents really wanted a boy and always said it was a good thing Jake was a boy, because they didn't want to have a fourth kid. You see where this is going?

Ryan was born when Jake was at his sickest, and Jake knew Ryan was supposed to be his replacement. Jake has been in remission for a decade, and he has always hated Ryan. Our parents also don't dote on Ryan like they did/do Jake. It's obvious to me that they regret him. They are perfectly adequate parents to Ryan when Jake isn't around, but when he is, they ignore him so Jake doesn't get upset.

On Thanksgiving Jake said he was thankful for his parents and sisters. Ryan was upset that he wasn't counted, and our parents ended up telling him off and sending him to his room. Ryan has been miserable ever since. He keeps asking me why Jake hates him. I decided he needed to know the truth, so he knew it wasn't anything he did. He was sad after I told him, but he thanked me for being honest.

Last night Ryan confronted our parents. They are furious with me. They demanded that I call Ryan and tell him what I said was a mean prank. They said I had no right to tell anyone their business or make up horrible conclusions. I didn't make it up. I know the truth. Am I the asshole for telling it to Ryan?

Edit: I confronted my parents about the possibility many of you brought up. They denied it, but I don't know. A lot of what you said makes perfect sense. I didn't get anything out of them either way.

Also, several of you think Ryan wasn't a planned pregnancy. Multiple comments raised the possibility, so I'm not going to answer them individually. Ryan was a planned pregnancy. Mom got on fertility meds (she was 39 and thought she would have difficulty conceiving) and she bought the pregnancy tests in a pack of six, like she was planning on needing to take a test several times. They were not surprised in any way when she got pregnant.","AmItheAsshole",5818,5818,0,0.97,3,0,1,555

My endo was so severe I was warned at a young age that getting pregnant would be difficult, though not impossible. I married my husband (32m) young and we started trying when I was 24 and we had no success after two years of trying. We tried fertility medication as a next step and that was unsuccessful. We had planned to go the IVF route when Covid ravaged the world and it put our plans on hold. Our first attempt failed but we had a success last month which left us so excited. We kept it to ourselves until Christmas when we told our families. Everyone was so happy for us except my sister, who broke down and started telling me I was selfish and how she hoped it wouldn't work.

BG:. My sister is 4 years older and she has moderate learning disabilities. This is something she was always self-conscious about. But I admired her so much. So I'd cheer her on and defend her like crazy as a kid if anyone was mean to her. Sometimes it felt like our paternal grandparents were. They were the only extended family we had and sometimes they would say things that seemed so harsh to me. They would tell her she couldn't manipulate people just because of her learning disability, they would tell her that she shouldn't be selfish. I would hear them argue with dad over it. I'd told them my sister had it rough and she needed our support. I adored my sister. When she was 15 and I was 11 I got home from school one day and she started yelling and telling me I was the worst sister, she wished I had never been born, called me miss perfect and she wanted me to die. This came out of nowhere. Our parents heard the arguing and separated us for the night and said we would talk the next morning. The next day she lied and told them I had bullied her for months and called her stupid and the R word. None of this was true. But she went around telling everyone. After that stuff changed between us. My grandparents argued with my parents because they acted like they believed her and started to coddle her more, which my grandparents said was not helping anything. I grew closer to them and they would tell me more about their concerns about my sister from before. They were my biggest support when I lost my ovary at 19.

Back to current day my sister had her reaction to the news and once she stopped crying she told me I should have let her be the only one to give our parents grandkids and she deserved to be the best at something. She told me she hoped I would miscarry and never conceive again so she could keep the title. I told her she was sick and that I couldn't believe I had adored her so much as a kid. I told her she could say goodbye because we were done with each other. She yelled that I was selfish. My parents are saying I need to understand and that our bad history just made her react in an odd way but that she's my sister and we're family and she needs extra help.

AITA?

EDIT: Hi everyone! Sorry for taking a long time to respond. I had no idea people were seeing the post so I went away to celebrate NYE with my husband. A question I have seen asked in several comments that I wanted to address here and now is about my sister's learning disability. I'm not sure what her exact dx her. I know she has trouble in school leaning, and I remember she struggled to read. Math was also a problem. I was always just told she had trouble in school, got made fun of for being ""dumb"" and I saw she would get embarrassed when doing homework. She had supports in school and had an IEP for most of her academic life.

He has an older sister who does not like me. My crime? Her husband got a little too flirty with me when my husband introduced us all and he had to be told to back off by not just me but my husband. Of course I was the wh*** trying to steal her man. The fact I never did anything to encourage it and actively told him to stop and walked away wasn't enough. It also wasn't an isolated thing with him but my husband intervened to make sure he knew we meant business.

She has 3 kids with the husband. Ever since that day we met she has kept me at arms length with her kids. And she's rude. Very rude. Has also treated me in very childish ways but it's whatever. I won't force myself into a place I am not wanted. I am kind to the kids but she never wants me spending time with them or talking too much with them.

But now she is jealous because my sister's children are close to me and my husband and I spoil them since I have fertility issues and might never get to be a mom. She called my husband out first and he told her that her kids were welcome but he wasn't going to take money we earned together and tell me I need to stay home or not speak to her kids while they're with him/us.

She then confronted me and accused me of treating her children badly. I told her she can't treat me badly, keep me out of her kids lives and expect them to benefit from me being their aunt. I told her I would love to spoil her kids too. But if I'm not welcome then I can't.

She said I was taking our issues out on her kids. Maybe I said things wrong here. AITA?","AmItheAsshole",5567,5567,0,0.97,1,0,1,417

We got through a hard winter, feed prices are high, hay is high, fuel is high, and summer is coming in like a rocking ball. Grass isn't coming in like it should and fertilizer is just too pricey. To make ends meet we sent a prize winning registered heifer to auction expecting to get $2,200 at minimum. She sold for $900. Worse than that, the other cattlemen were sell8ng off half-starved cows and newborns with the umbilical cord attached because we are all so pinched for funds and resources. This week I started growing banana trees to help supplement the girls and transplanting cattails into the pasture in hopes that it'll be hardy enough to withstand whatever weather events we get this year.

I thought we had more time. Now I wonder if we can support these animals for even 2 or 3 more years.

EDIT: I am a Texas cattle rancher. 

I live in what used to be wetlands, but the ecology now is such that there are large dry, clay areas, and some land dips that retain water and those dips are where I've been planting the cattail and banana trees. 

I did not choose the the ranch life. My father-in-law passed in 2016, my husband has had this land since the 1840s and dies not want to sell. I'm a psych grad student and do PR for nonprofits, but those animals have kept us afloat through many hard times. I've just been learning as I go for the past 6 years.

With land like this, you cannot keep your agricultural tax exemption if you don't keep animals on it - specifically commercial cattle. We cannot afford the taxes otherwise. Even with the exemption we struggle to find enough money to pay the taxes.

I don't know anything about growing large crops, nor do I have the hundreds of thousands of dollars to jump into that kind of operation. I have $470 in my bank account.

I do not eat red meat. I grow backyard vegetables and can my own foods to offset grocery costs. I keep a few chickens for a supply of eggs. 

When I say I thought I had more time, I mean I thought I had more time to transition. My dream since we moved here in 2016 has always been to use our land as a wildlife refuge, restore native fauna, and set aside acres for solar energy. But then, where do I find the money to invest in such an enormous project? I'm not some trust fund baby; I grew up far far in the country, in the woods, a shack without hot water or electricity.

Having land doesn't make me rich. Being a rancher doesn't mean that I'm conservative. Being stuck in a position that contributes to the climate crisis doesn't mean I don't care. Having cattle doesn't mean I don't love my animals. Being Texan doesn't mean that I want to burn the world to the ground. 

I'm just a man, trying to pay most of my bills, and getting by the only way that I'm able to. Those cows are the only ones protecting us from being homeless and they are the only sliver of hope we have of one day putting away a few thousand dollars if some tragedy should strike.

For the dumbasses: I am growing banana trees to supplement cattle nutrition. I don't need bananas, the cows need the leaves and stems for food. Cattails usually do well in water pit areas, and the cows love them. Grow tf up. Land isn't just arid or just wet. For the other fools, grass growing in non-grazed areas is wildly different that grazed pasture.

 In addition, why is it so hard to believe that a gay man, married, with a background in PR, earning a Master's in Psych &amp; runs a ranch exists?

I'm literally just a human being who has more jobs than one, wearing several hats, and I am frightened about the collapse. I'm terrified that my nieces will be prosecuted for having an abortion or miscarriage, I'm scared that TX will pass a bill nullifying my marriage. WTF is wrong with you people?! 

If you genuinely believe that ranchers and farmers are not collapse aware, you are a complete fool. We live the land and we see it and feel it. We are trapped in an imploding system. Just so you are aware, we are also struggling to fill the fridge and pantry. We are not rich. We are not even well off. 

Those commenters who chose to be nasty, get a grip. We are all going down. The whole globe is suffering. Don't be such a dick. I'm only someone who shared their experience, I'm not fucking Elon Musk.","collapse",5200,5200,0,0.9,17,1,3,1349

Hope you like a lot of dirt.","Let me preface this by noting that this revenge was not my doing. At least... not exactly.  It happened back in the 90's when I was in high school, and centered around the type of school I attended.

So, in case you weren't aware, it's very common in agricultural communities to have what are known as 'farmer's schools'. That's not a technical term, but more just something easy to define them. The schools are generally organized by the local farmers, and while you still study the various courses needed to get into college, you also study farming technology courses, and get credit hours for work study (IE working on one or more farms).  The area I lived in was surrounded by a number of large farms which grew cotton primarily.  So during the year, we'd spend time out in the field both tilling, planting, and harvesting.  

One of the farms near the school, was this thousand acre spread that like the others grew mostly cotton, though sometimes they rotated to soybeans, or silage. (Basically corn, but you don't harvest it.)  This farm had a long partnership with the school, so the students provided near free labor for the farmer.  The farmer leased this property from some out of state owner, and paid them a portion of the revenue from the harvest.

Imagine my surprise then, when I and many of my classmates arrived at the farm to do our work study, and the farmer instructed some to crew the sprayers and start spraying herbicide on the fields, while others (myself included) were to take tractors and discs and plow everything under.  The farmer wanted every square inch of the fields returned to just dirt.  We were shocked, to say the least, but after some discussion we set to work.  It took us the better part of a weekend to do so, and when we were done the field was in a beautiful, if barren, state.  The farmer thanked each of us personally, and paid us about  500 dollars each. (Quite the sum for a 90's high school senior).

We returned to the school, told our headmaster that the 'contract' was completed, and he informed us that the farmer would no longer be working with the school, and we'd be sent to one of the other larger farms for the rest of the year and our work study.  

It was probably two or three months later before word started going around about why we'd been instructed to destroy the crop.  Granted, these were just rumors, but based on how things turned out for the farmer, I suspect there's some truth to it.  So, apparently the landowner had decided that he was going to not renew the lease the farmer had on the land.  This lease renewal just so happened to  fall a few weeks before harvest season would start.  Given that the average cotton farm earns about 1,500 dollars per acre,  a 1000 acre farm would easily net the owner 1.5 million dollars.  About 500k of that being pure profit.  I don't know what the farmer's lease was, but it stands to reason that it wasn't anywhere near that.   So this landowner had figured out a neat little 'trick'.  Let the farmer get a good crop planted, and then refuse to renew the lease. The farmer would leave the plants in the field, and the landowner would just need to pay some contractors to come harvest it, and they'd earn a profit.

Since at the time, the farmer's lease wasn't yet up, he decided to prevent that from happening.  His act of revenge against the owner, was to prevent them from cashing in on their hard work. Sure, it destroyed his farm, and he had to sell off most everything he owned to buy some property for himself, but he'd proved a point.

The owner did try to sue the farmer, though he (the owner) really didn't have a leg to stand on, or so I was told. I think the court ruled that since the farmer was still under the lease when he had the land tilled under, then it was his property to do with as he wished, and thus the landowner couldn't tell him what to do with his property.

I learned a rather valuable lesson from that man, beyond what I learned about farming.  That lesson was, never...**ever** cross someone with nothing to lose.

Edit: Since it was brought up in the comments, let me add some details here.

Cotton is one of the few crops which leave a negative nutrient value in the soil. Meaning that after harvest, even if you till the dead plants under, or even if you till them prior to harvest, you won't have as much nutrients as you started with. That's why farmers will plant another crop, usually winter wheat, in place and then till it under rather than harvesting it. This is something commonly called a ""green manure"" but it works to put nutrients that the cotton pulled out of the soil, back into it. While the ground wouldn't have been completely dead or sterile, any crop planted on that tract of land, without further treatment of the soil, wouldn't have produced the same acre per acre yield that a comparable crop would have had he gone to harvest, and planted the secondary crop.  Which means that the landowner would either have to plant the green manure, and spend money that way; or pay by the ton to use artificial fertilizer.","ProRevenge",4967,4967,0,0.99,7,0,0,153

Things were fine until when we were visiting my family a few days ago for my dads birthday, he saw some old pictures of me when I was 20 and clearly heavily pregnant. He was upset and asked me what this was and thought i'd had a child and gave them up, I explained to him that my older sister and her husband had been struggling with fertility and she'd had several miscarriages so I offered to carry their child for them and my 7 year old niece was the result of this. 

I in no way feel maternal towards her, she is  their biological child and i've never felt I was anything but the handy oven for that bun. I never brought it up before as I didn't think it mattered and it was so long ago that it wasn't really anyone else's business. He however feels differently and when we left he told me I should have told him and said how it wasn't fair i'd been willing to give my sister a child but wouldn't even consider having one with him. 

I got upset as there is a big difference between carrying a child and raising a child and told him as much, I told him I was sorry for not telling him but I honestly hadn't felt it was his business as it had been years before we got together, I then reminded him how *he* had been the one to say he could live without children as i'd warned him long ago. He is still upset with me, I honestly didn't think I did anything wrong here. AITA?

Edit: As people keep asking i'm including this information in the post. Yes, it's preferred that you be over 21 and have had at least one child to be a surrogate however in our Country Doctors will judge on a case by case situation and will sometimes allow it so long as the surrogate is over 18 even if they have never had a child before. We were one of those cases though they tried to discourage it. My sister didn't want to use a stranger however as she was scared, in our Country the person who carries the child has all the rights and if they decided to keep the child my sister and her husband could do nothing about it.

I (35m) used to be married to my high school sweetheart ""Kelly"" (35f). We got married after undergrad and overall I would say that we were really happy. The biggest conflict that I would say we had was the topic of children. Not the idea of actually having them but when. I've always wanted to be a dad and wanted to have my kids while I was still young enough to run around with them while they were kids and have a good adult relationship with them once they got older.

Kelly brought up a lot of good points about needing to get married, living fully on our own, and being out of debt first. For about five years I worked a job I had no passion for solely because of the large paycheck and I was able to nearly wipe out our debt completely (we didn't have a lot to begin with in the first place). Then Kelly said she wanted a house, so we got one, then a few months in she talked about wanting to go to grad school.

Even though we often fought about children, in the end I always supported her choices because I didn't want her to resent me. I would often ask her if Kelly had ever changed her mind about wanting kids but she assured me that she still did, just not now. I asked when would she be and it always felt like she kept moving the goal post whenever she'd list her requirements, and that I was painted as a jerk for ""pressuring"" her for kids. Unfortunately, after weeks of not feeling well, Kelly was diagnosed with an illness. It was rough but I stood by her and she pulled through but the cost was her fertility.

I felt like a jerk again because of part of me resented Kelly for not agreeing to have kids sooner and that resentment grew when Kelly refused to look into using a surrogate, insisting that either we were both the bio parents or neither of us were. In the end I couldn't take it and just divorced her.

A lot of people called me selfish, sexist, misogynistic, etc. but I just wasn't sure if this was something that I would be able to truly let go of. I let Kelly keep the house and moved out of town. Eventually I met and fell in love with Angela (32f) and after shortly moving into together she got pregnant so we got married. She's entering her third trimester with our baby girl and I'm so excited.

A friend back in college moved back to the states and wanted to have a small party to see everyone. He invited Kelly and me, so I checked in with him privately and asked if it would be okay to bring my wife and he said that it was cool so I did. This was the first time I saw Kelly in person for years and she looked well enough. I was polite but kept my distance and thought everything was good until the next day when I got a barrage of texts and DMs blasting me for having the audacity to parade my heavily pregnant new (younger) wife in front of my infertile ex-wife. I had no malicious intentions and it has been a few years plus I asked beforehand just to double check so AITA?

ETA: Talked about this with someone in the comments

Kelly said it would be too upsetting at the idea of me having a child with another woman regardless of how the child was conceived. It was either adopt or nothing at all. I honestly felt like there was no way we could progress in the relationship without one of us resenting the other so I filed.

If she truly didn't want kids she put on a great performance. Before her illness she would constantly gush over other people's babies, insisted buying a house in a good school district for our future kids, and even talked in extensive detail about wanting to be a stay-at-home for up to 6 years. I think Kelly just assumed we'd always have time and then life threw a curve ball.

If Kelly had stated that she would've been open to having children sooner under the condition that I be the primary caretaker I would've done it. I would've even taken a lesser paying job so I could have the free time to do it. I NEVER wanted to put in a position where she felt like she would have to give up her career entirely.  


ETA 2: Stepped away for a little bit but I just wanted to be clear about something. I did NOT leave Kelly while she was still sick. It was a year after she was healthy again and we had been in therapy for months.","AmItheAsshole",4930,4930,0,0.94,0,0,1,1151

**My stepmom was my dad's AP**

My stepmom was my Dad´s AP

This is my first time using reddit and english is not my first language

When i (22M) was 4 my Dad(42M) divorced my mom. About a year later he introduced me to my stepmom (42F). She had two twin girls( N and D 22F). They married only a few months and went on to have three more kids, G( 16M) L(10M) and S(4F).

My father adopted N and D because their bio father was not involved. I´ve always considered all 5 of them ( N,D,G,L and S) my siblings and we´ve never used step or half to refer to eachother.

When i was 6, shortly after G´s birth, my mom passed away in a car accident and because of it i started to live with my dad full time.

My relationship with my  stepmom improved from there. She never adopted me however she, along with my dad, keept my mom´s memory alive by keeping in touch with my maternal grandparents and other relatives and visiting her grave with me on special days. I started calling her mom when i was around 7 or 8 and she refers to me as her eldest child ( me and the twins are the same age but i was born first)

After i turned 18 i started to work but i continued to live with my parents.

Last week i was in the attic when i found a photo album that i have never seen before. I opened it and i saw several pictures of my dad, my stepmom and the twins when they were babies, which made no sense to me because, like i said we were todlers when our parents met.

I decided to confront my parents about it. They were sit alone in the kitchen and asked them how they met, they told the same story, that soon after my dad´s divorce he met my stepmom though a mutual friend. when they were done i place one of the pictures on the table and told them that i wanted the truth.

I could tell by my dad´s face he understood what i meant. My dad told me that his marriage with my mom was going though a hard time because of my mom´s infertility issues, one day he met my stepmom and things escalated quickly and when he was ready to leave my mom she founded out that she was pregant but so did my stepmom at the same time, he lied to my mom several times so that he could spend time with my stepmom and the twins, one day he admited to my mom that he was having an affair and they got divorced.

I looked at my stepmom and she was in tears, they both tried to say sorry but i just couldn´t stay in that house any longer. i´m currently staying at my gf´s parents house. I have talked to G, L and S, it pained me alot and G has said that S has cried for me and that just breaks my heart.

I have refused to talk with my parents or to N and D. The three of them lied to me.

I feel like my life was built on lies and i am lost, i do not know what to do, i still love my sisters and my parents but they, especialy my parents, have hurted me. so much.

Edit:fixed typos

Edit: fixed typos

Edit: 

I wanna thank everyone for their input on my situation. 

I have come to the conclusion that i should talk with N and D, i will send them a message so that we can meet in person and talk about it.

I will also try to meet my younger siblings because i have not seen them since last week, just talked to them over the phone, and i missed them.

About my parents i do not know what i will do, i need to talk to them so that i can get atleast some cloesure but i don't know if i will be able to do it.

Thank you everyone!

**My sisters knew about our father's affair with their mother**

Read my last post so you can understand.

Before anything i would like to thank everyone who commented on my last post.

I have seen common questions being asked i i'll reply to them:

-""Did your mom really had fertility issues?""-Yes, her family  has told me many times she got really afected by it and that my birth was a got her over the moon.

-""Did the twins knew?""-i did not knew if they knew thats i talked to them.

Now onto the update;

After i made my post i made a group chat with the twins and texted them and we decided to met 

My GF wanted to come with me but i told her i would rather go alone. When i arrived they were already there, they asked started to try to make small talk i just asked them if they knew, they started to tear up and told me that they always knew my dad but only knew that they were his daughters when they were 16 because our parents told them, they initially wanted to tell me but my dad and stepmom pressed them not to saying that if they told me it would destroy our family. I asked how were things at home, they told me that G and L started to be rude to them and to our parents while S was asking about me.

They asked me if i could forgive them, i told them that i still love them but i just need time they told me they understood. I said i was sorry and that i shouldn't blame them for our dad's mistakes, they told me they should have told me earlier, we hugged and cried together. We said our goodbyes and then i went home, my gf asked me how i was and i just broke down, she held me tight and told me to not hold on and that she was there for me, words cannot discrive how much i love this woman she has been my rock though out all of this.

I talked with my younger siblings this morning and we met at park. I hugged them really tight especialy S, i'm super atached to her and i am really protective of her i tried to explain to her, in a todler friendly way, that i was mad at our parets because they did a ""bad thing"" and not at her, she asked if i was ever going back home, i told her i didn't knew but i still loved her. I talked to my brothers to see how they were holding on,G and L told me they had been having a hard time because they never tough our parents could do something so horrible, they told me they missed me but understood why i had to leave. 

We spent the morning together and after luch they went back home.

I haven't talk to my parents yet and i plan to call my maternal grandparents tonight to see if they knew or not.

Thank everyone for their support you guys have helped me a lot

**I talked with my grandparents about my father's affair.**

TLDR about my last two posts: My dad cheated on my mom with my stepmom, my twin stepsisters whom my father adopted are actually his bio daughters.

Yesterday i went to visit my maternal grandparents, first we mad the usual small talk and then i told them i needed to tell them something serious.

I layed it all out, the affair, the twins faternity everything . To say my grandparents were shocked would be an understatement. My grandma started to cry her heart out asking herself how could my dad ""hurt my baby girl like that"" my granddad was more angry he called my dad and stepmom everything he could think of. My grandparents always tough that my parents had divorced because they didn't just worked out and because they were young and despite not being their son-in-law anymore they mainted a great relationship with my dad.

After my grandma calmed down she asked me how i was doing, i told her that its been hard but i am doing better now she said she still couldn't believe my dad would do something so horrible to my mom, my grandpa said if my dad is lucky they would never laid eyes on eachother because my grandpa would do something that would put him in jail, if you understand me.

We spent the rest of the day catching up and talking about my mom, overall it was very intense but opening up to people who loved my mother like i did helped me a bit.

Thanks for reading.

**I confroted my father and my stepmom about their affair**


Read my last posts for context. 

My dad and stepmom have wanted to meet me up and talk since i've found out about their affair, i wasn't feeling ready to do it yet, my gf said i should, eventually, meet them so that at least i can hear their side and told me she wanted to come with me. 

We( me and my gf) and they (dad and stepmom) decided to meet yesterday, on a public space. We arrived before them, i was feeling nervous and was shaking my leg, my gf held my hand and told me not to worry about because she was there for me. 

When they arrived i was looking at the floor and couldn't just look them in the eyes, my dad was trying to ask me things, like how was i and just asked him to explain everything, to moment he met my mom to the moment he divorced her. 

My dad, told me that he met my at their church and the moment he laid eyes on her he fell in love and soon after they started dating. My dad said  my mom was ""a perfect partner"" he said she was kind, loving and very concerned about him. My dad proposed to her on her 18th birthday and she cried tears of joy, they went to get married, my dad said that he never saw my mom so happy until the day i was born, but they had problems having kids, they had a few misscarriages and then my dad started to cheat on my mom with my stepmom because my stepmom ""could give me what your mom couldn't"". My dad started to spent less and less time at home, at this point he had started crying, he said my mom tried her best and told him everyday of much she loved him and how sorry she was she couldn't give him a family. 

My father was planing on leaving my mom but she told him she was pregnant, in the same week my dad found out my stepmom was pregnant as well, my dad inicially believed that i was going to be a misscarriage but it didn't happened. He said that when i was born my mom couldn't stop looking at me crying and smiling at the same time, my dad said that my mom held his hand and said ""we finally did it,my love"". 

I started to cry a bit, my dad and stepmom tried to confort me but i just asked how my mom reacted to my dad's affair and why did my dad waited 4 years to divorce her. 

My dad said that during those 4 years my mom became overprotective of me (he gave a few examples like my mom had my crib in their room when i was a baby, whenever i was crying she was the one to calm down and didn't let anyone else do it, she didn't let anyone hold me until i was a bit older, she wanted to be a stay-at-home-mom so that she could spend more time with me, it took my dad and grandparents from both sides to convince her not to) which caused them to have less time alone and that during those 4 years my mom's sex drive got lower and she didn't got pregant again when they had sex. 

When my dad told my mom about the affair he laid down everything, including the twins. My mom begged him not to leave her, making promises she would have more sex with him and if my dad wanted he could continue to have the affair and have another children that my mom would treat them well, my dad said his mind was made up, my mom cried and asked him to leave her alone for a while. 

When my dad got back home he heard my mom singing my song(context i'm a leo and my mom always sang ""leãozinho"" from Caetano Velozo to me) he went to my room and peeked through the door and saw my mom in my room holding me in her arms while singing, after i fell asleep my mom started crying softly probably so that i wouldn't wake up, my dad said she started kissing me in the forehead and saying she loved me over and over again. My dad told me my mom sleept with me that night and the next day they started to discuss their divorce. My dad said that my mom did her best to not potray him as the bad guy and when i asked who i was going to live with my mom said i was going to be living with her one week and with my dad the other. 

My dad tried to guilt trip me, he said that my mom could tell everyone about the affair and could push to have full custody of me but ""she understood it wouldn't be healthy for you"". I simply asked about the twins, how was their relationship with him before and why did he told them. 

He said that when the twins were born my mom was already at home but he was able to visit my stepmom in the hospital, i asked him if he was always the twin's legal father to wich he replied yes, my father said that he would visit the twins and my stepmom at least once a week then my stepmom said that they tough the twins should know because they wanted the twins to learn the truth by them. I asked when where they planned to tell me, they didn't said anything. 

I told my dad that hia actions showed that he was norhing more than a selfish asshole, that he hurted me, the twins and my mom, all people who he should have loves and respected. I told him we could never have any type of meaningfull relationship, to forget about being at my wedding or meet my kids. The maximum i could do was tolerating him and his wife for the sake of my siblings,mainly my 4 year old sister. 

My stepmom tried to intervine, she said ""son i ..."" before she could continue my gf replied that i wasn't her son, that she was just my father's lover and that my mom had died. We soon left. 

As we were walking home my gf asked if i was alright to which i said yes. When we got home she held my hand and took me to our room, she laid in our bed and buried my face on her chest she said ""I want you to know how proud i am, you have shown how much strong and mature you are, but you don't need to act tough around me. Please, let it all out."" I started to cry as i have never did before. After what it seemed a eternity i told my gf i wanted to see some of my mom's pictures so that i could calm down. 

It started alright but then i got to two pictures taken one after another, in the first one my mom was holding me and looking at me with a big smile in the other one she was giving me a big kiss and i just lost it again. She didn't deserved any of this shit, i wished she could have found someone better than my dad, someone who could have loved and treated her like she deserved. 

I'm a litter better now but i'm still a emocional mess. My gf was said that she has been worried about my mental state and that she wants me to see a therapist,  i told her i agree but asked her to do the appointement because i was not capable of doing so. 

I want to thank everyone who commented, who sent me dms and gave me advice. Thank you a lot, it means a lot to me. If something else happens in my life i will keep you all updated.

**My dad's side of the family are guilttriping me so that i can forgive him.**

English is not my first language.

So i (22M) am NC with my dad(42M) and my stepmom( aka my dad's lover)(42F) because long story short my mom had fertility issues, my dad cheated on her and my stepmom and mom got pregnant at the same time which means that my twin stepsisters(22F) are actually my halfsisters.

My dad and stepmom have tried to convice the twins and my brothers (16 M,10M) to talk to me,my siblings have refused.

Dad and stepmom have also tried to poisened my sister (4F) against me but my siblings didn't allowed it and i had to explain to my sister why i was mad at her parents.

Since then my dad's family( dad's siblings and parents) and even some family friends have been harassing me and guilt trip me to forgive my dad and stepmom saying things like ""they were always good parents"" ""they love you"" and things like that.

I have told them to stop but they continue to message me, especialy my grandma, saying all this crap about ""family"".

Part of me wants to block them but i am having a hard time doing it. I don't exactly know what my dad and stepmom have told them and i really don't want to go NC with half my family over my dad's mistakes.

Any advice is helpfull.

You posted frequently in the relationship advice sub. The 3 people MAY have followed you to see if you update. Alternatively, your posts in the listen to this sub may have made those 3 follow to get more music recommendations. Lastly, they may be creepier creeps and hoping you turn into a nsfw post. You could troll them by joining the chairs underwater sub and posts Not Submerged Fully under Water stuff. As to the rest. You have specifically requested the internet not to do something that is both easy and mostly harmless... You opened Pandora's box.

But instead, she caught the attention of 4000+ new creeps, eager to learn about her every move. Now she's trapped in the inescapable hamster wheel of social media. Let that be a friendly word of warning, something you won't find in any guidebook: the next time you submit a post on reddit, make sure you know the kind of audience you're attracting, or you may find yourself a target for creeps . . . in The Twilight Zone.

&gt;[Commenter:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jdw1l1/hello_friends_lunch_today_was_classic_eggy_toast/g9bf094/) Is it weird that your accidental rise to fame is kinda comforting? Like you clearly have no idea wtf is happening but you're just rollin with it. Don't stress my dude, the world has just gone to shit and we need something else to look forward to.  
&gt;

&gt;[Commenter:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jg84ij/day_10_lunch/g9ot1k3/) This is like a side story in a rpg game  
&gt;  
&gt;[OOP:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jg84ij/day_10_lunch/g9ou5kk/) I really liked those make food side quests in games like running a kitchen in JRPGs or in Paper Mario when youre Peach and you have to make cakes for a reason I dont remember

&gt;  
&gt;[OOP:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jindcb/day_11_lunch_please_excuse_the_chip_in_my_bowl/ga7ksj1/) Its stayed very consistent at the 4200 mark? Frankly surprised I havent seen drop off. I thought people would get tired of it eventually, heaven knows Im running out of ways to prepare eggs. Next up is the recommended omelette I think, just gotta figure out the mechanics of omelette-making

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;[Commenter 1:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jindcb/day_11_lunch_please_excuse_the_chip_in_my_bowl/ga7pl1r/) Are those your children in your bowl? The eggs?  
&gt;  
&gt;[OOP:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jindcb/day_11_lunch_please_excuse_the_chip_in_my_bowl/ga7q2sv/) When you have as many children as I do you have to start getting creative

&gt;[Commenter:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jkkegb/day_12_salad/gajpfyo/) Have you ever not really wanted an egg but because of your Reddit fame, you have the obligation to eat eggs? Or do you just not post the non egg related foods?  
&gt;  
&gt;[OOP:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jkkegb/day_12_salad/gajuat1/) Ill admit I eat eggs slightly more often than I did before, but if anything its increased my love of them. And yeah, I dont post non-egg meals.

&gt;  
&gt;[OOP:](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheoreticalDinosaur/comments/jluixq/day_13_boo/ghsk5b0/) And I missed you!! Posting was fun but also stressful in a way? So thats why. But I hope youve been good? How was your end of the year?

We had our first baby young and were flat broke, unplanned, not ready etc. We made it work and luckily, I really succeeded financially afterwards.

She asked us for the money a few weeks ago and my wife and I have been discussing it. She texts her or me every couple of days to ""check on our deal"". 
Yesterday the family way at our place for my 13yro's birthday and my SIL just blurts out ""you two were poor when you had her, why won't you help me have one now that you're rich?"" I told her to please let it go right now and we will talk about it in private. She called me a selfish and entitled AH in front of both our families. I got angry and told her that now she is for sure not getting our money. 

Her family has been blowing up my phone, calling me an AH.

It reaches a peak of religiosity that is suddenly interrupted by am explosion and EVERYBODY immediately snaps back into their conditioning and the battle resumes, with only one or two bothering to glance at what is both a miracle and the reason the soldiers are there as they leave.

I (18f) am adopted. My aunt and uncle have made comments about this in the past about how I'm not really family or whatever. It doesn't really bother me anymore because I barely see them apart from at family reunions and stuff. They are also homophobic, racist, every kind of ist etc etc. They couldn't get pregnant because of various reasons, including the fact that my aunt is pushing forty. Anyways, they spent a bunch of money on fertility treatments before eventually using an egg donor. (Also, i had just gotten a hysterectomy at the time for medical reasons and my aunt made some weird comment to my mom about how i was wasting my purpose as a woman and how i could've been a surrogate for them (vomit).) They also said they didnt want to adopt, they wanted their own kids, didn't want abandoned problem kids. So the baby was born and shock, horror, surprise, the baby's brown. Apparently, the egg donor wrote caucasian as ethnicity but had a Guyanese grandmother. They had the baby with them at the family reunion and my aunt in particular looked tired and upset. I couldn't resist making a comment to my mom within earshot of them, that if they'd adopted they could have picked out a nice white baby and maybe they mistook the ivf clinic for the build a bear workshop. (I've heard they might be trying to sue the clinic.) My aunt got really upset and started crying, my uncle turned red and started yelling at me about how I had no right to talk about their private life, that i was a bitch, all this crap. Then they left. My mom thought my comments were funny but says I should apologise to keep the peace and my dad says that they needed to hear the truth. I think i might be the TA because it's kind of unfair to the baby to bring her into it. So Reddit AITA?


Update: to clarify some things 1) i am chinese, however even if i had been white, my comment would have still not been racist. Racist means to show prejudice or discrimination to one race because of their race. I don't think anyone would argue that white people are an opressed minority.

2) as for the racist stuff theyve said, they were hardcore trump supporters during both the 2016 and 2020 elections and called my mixed race friend a half breed.

3) This is unfair to the baby. I do feel sorry for her and I regret bringing an innocent baby into this. I hope my aunt and uncle learn from this and maybe become less prejudiced.","AmItheAsshole",4347,4347,0,0.93,4,0,2,531

Secondly I feel cheapened because of their attitude to STDs. If I caught something off them why wouldnt that matter, just because Im in my 40s ? 

Thirdly there is this attitude that THEY know they dont have anything nasty - therefore i should too. In what universe do they think that is right ? Im not a mind reader (or gullible for that matter).

I *wholeheartedly* believe that just about everyone would benefit from growing some flowers or vegetables of their own. The truest magic, the most spiritual experience that I've ever had, is nurturing a plant from dry seed to ten-foot bean vine, snapping a pod off and eating it where I stood. I go out into my garden in the predawn light and I just breathe, and it gives me such an incredible peace. Humans are better, happier, when they get out into nature; even on a brain chemistry level just being around plants improves our health.

But Victory gardens? I don't mean School Garden Army gardens of WWI, and I'm not talking about Europe, but the American victory gardens whose pamphlets I'm seeing shared all over this week? Those gardens everyone in the States was encouraged to grow during WWII?That movement was a desperate propaganda effort on the part of the government to prevent the public from feeling the food shortages brought on by forcing the Japanese American population into concentration camps.

Japanese immigrants and their American-born children grew *forty percent* of the produce in the West Coast--produce that the entire country ate. And when the exclusion zones were put into place, everyone who was 1/16th Japanese or greater by descent lost everything they had. Land they'd never get back (they were given pennies on the dollar for it after the war, but it was not returned to them), belongings they had to sell immediately or else put into storage (where an estimated 80% of it was stolen and sold; after the war, attempts to get recompense from the government for those losses required extensive paperwork and proof; people who didn't have that proof? Like, say, if they'd just spent the last few years in sheds behind barbed wire? They were threatened with extensive fines and five years in prison for their ""fraudulent"" claims).

They lost two hundred thousand acres of the most carefully-worked, most fertile farmland in the country. *72 million dollars* in land, in 1940's dollars. And it had been taken on purpose, and that theft is *the main reason* that Japanese immigrants and their American-born children were interned.

Austin Anson, the managing secretary of the Grower-Shipper Vegetable Association, said:

&gt;Were charged with wanting to get rid of the Japs for selfish reasons. We might as well be honest. We do. Its a question of whether the white man lives on the Pacific Coast or the brown men. They came to this valley to work, and they stayed to take over. They offer higher land prices and higher rents than the white man can pay for land. They undersell the white man in the markets. They can do this because they raise their own labor. They work their women and children while the white farmer has to pay wages for his help. If all the Japs were removed tomorrow, wed never miss them in two weeks, because the white farmers can take over and produce everything the Jap grows. And we dont want them back when the war ends, either.

And he got what he wanted, the others like him who agitated for it--farm associations full of white farmers--got what they wanted. The land was stolen along with everything else, and put in their hands. But the thing is, all that beautifully tended land, cared for at Japanese agricultural standards, fertilized and watered in those specific ways? Dust Bowl farmers didn't have a damn clue how to maintain that level of care. So they didn't. They just continued their own comfortable, destructive farming habits--and the crops died.

Forty percent of West Coast produce had come from those farms, and suddenly those farms were failing. The vegetables were smaller and fewer, the fruits died on the tree, there were disease issues, irrigation issues.

What do you do, as a government, when all at once there's a massive series of food shortages coming, specifically for fruits and vegetables? How do you keep people calm, how do you keep agitators at a minimum?

Victory gardens.

They were presented as a way for the community to pull together, a way to be patriotic, a way to really stick it to the enemy. Everyone should grow their own vegetables! Tear out that turf, put in some tomatoes. Do Your Part. And people did!

And I won't say that people didn't come together because of it, and I won't say that there aren't a lot of justifiably happy memories about individual experiences with their own victory gardens. Gardening is good for the soul, eating something you grew yourself is tremendously satisfying, being able to watch a plant at every stage is something approaching holy. Anything that reinforced the cycle of life, in the face of all that death, had to do good things for the minds and health of the people working those garden plots.

But the movement only existed because of the horrific thing that our government did to people of Japanese descent, and I wish to fuck we didn't romanticize it.

Where the only food will be genetically modified or synthetically lab produced. Meat and naturally grown food will only be for the globalists. People need to open their eyes.

I stand with the Dutch farmers  =ª<û

They are fighting against the WEF who are taking steps to seize their land by stopping them farming.

Meanwhile in SRI LANKA -  The newly installed WEF President is simply more of the same. He has vowed to crackdown on fascist protests. He means his own people, desperately trying to stop the globalist experiment that was originally responsible for destroying farming and their economy. 

Bill Gates and his WEF friends are infiltrating and buying up farms around the world, while Western governments are bribing farmers to retire.

In July 2019, the WEF explained how global farming can take on climate change. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/07/agriculture-climate-change-solution/

*How's the protecting jobs part going*? https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/02/how-to-fight-climate-change-in-agriculture-while-protecting-jobs

Apparently, across these two articles, we need to ""re-examine"" (in 2019) the relationship between agriculture and climate and begin a ""just transition"" to new forms of agriculture, embodied in principle in the Green New Deal. *How's that going*? 

The video is about Germany's ""Just Transition"" to a life after coal. *How's that working out*? https://youtu.be/9EmsA7wG2lo

The second article links to this Malthusian charmer, which openly advocates for lowering fertility rates, among other suggestions. https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/12/how-to-sustainably-feed-10-billion-people-by-2050-in-21-charts

I quote *""2. limiting meat consumption to 52 calories per day by 2050""* and *""4. Achieve replacement level fertility rates""*?

**They've been planning this disaster for a while!** https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/10/our-food-system-is-at-risk-of-crossing-environmental-limits-here-s-how-to-ease-the-pressure

Check out the section on *""stronger regulation of water and fertilizers""*. If they cant buy your farm, they'll make it prohibitively expensive to produce or operate. Only corporately ran farms will be eligible for support, at least until they collapse the privately owned ones. 

Another reason why they wanted lockdowns, most small businesses operate in the food and restaurant sector, bankrupting these small businesses limits everyone's availability of food at the same time it stops the farmer selling to the restaurant, interrupting this self sustained micro economy. 

This is just from WEFs own website, I hope this answers any doubts on the ensuing food collapse! When one company holds so much power, but comes from the richest and oldest families of the world. You need to question what their agendas are! Controlling the media, farming, land, banking, medications, food supply and now plagues. **Wake up**!","conspiracy",4192,4192,0,0.86,15,0,3,670

We have 3 beautiful kids. We support our kids, we live in our dream home, we vacation often, life is good for us I have no complaints.

The problem is when I was in college ( I was 19)a classmate of mine and her wife approached me about being a donor for her and her wife. They were both in their late 20's and wanted to have children. So I agree. I told my parents about it.Lawyers were involved that I was not to seek them out or try to contact them or the kids. Everyone was on the same Page eventually found out they both were able to get pregnant. A few months later I signed some more papers at the lawyers office.Never heard anything else they moved on I moved on.  When visiting my parents I, my wife and I ran into this family. Their son looks EXACTLY like me, to the point where it was uncomfortable. Their daughter looks like my sister.They introduced us it was akward but pleasant. My wife was completely blindsided ....but I understand.

I never bought it up with my wife because when we first started dating kids and fertility was a huge trigger for her because she had been told she would never have kids. But then we started popping out babies so I never felt the need to bring this up because I could legally never be involved with these kids. Like ever. 

She's threatening divorce

She's really struggling with the facts that our kids have siblings. I try to tell her that they don't that they aren't my kids and these women (their mothers) mean literally nothing to me. I go years with even giving them a thought. In hindsight I could have, but I really was trying not to trigger a very sensitive issue for her and we eventually have beautiful children of our own.So I feel like TA.


ETA-
I have acknowledged my wife's feelings. She's handed me my ass several times. 
-I haven't even tried to tell her shes wrong for being upset.  
-I am trying to get her to agree to therapy. These  pregnancies we're done in a clinic I did NOT HAVE S*X WITH THEM.
-I have had copies of everything sent over to show my wife including NDA (cuz we went to the same university) and parental rights.


Hello reddit, another edit and update. 
I am giving her space, I have validated her feelings.I am taking whatever reaction she throws at me because I understand that she is shocked and upset. She still has not agree to therapy. I will start therapy alone to see if she will eventually join me. I'm allowed to think divorce is an overreaction 

My parents got involved because I was 19 to make sure I would not be financially liable. So they also signed NDA. NDA states not to contact, approach or discuss the biology of all parties involved. I will. I will not disclose anyones age apart from my own, I will only say they donor children are over a decade older then my kids.","AmItheAsshole",4188,4188,0,0.95,1,0,1,1120

UPDATE

Ive gotten a lot of messages and questions regarding a update ,  I met to talk with my fiancé this morning and figured I would share the outcome of that conversation. As well as answer a lot of questions Ive seen in comments or that I have received privately.

I have received a lot of questions/comments about his body, his choice. And yes, I do agree with this statement. I said in my original post I respect his decision. It was his choice, his body, and his right to have a vasectomy performed. I never said I was upset that he had it done, but rather upset that when we began to start trying he acted as though he had not had it done and kept it hidden. Leaving me wondering why i couldnt get pregnant when he knew exactly why. That was the issue. I dont understand how that wasnt apparent.

Further, I had a lot of questions about how I couldnt tell he had it done. I know nothing about vasectomys. So yes, I believed his claim of having it done when I was gone on a girls trip for my 21st birthday. But comments about the healing time frame and follow up testing made me doubt this/doubt that he had it done. The more I looked into the time frame of having the procedure done, I doubted him. 

Before all of this came out, I never had any doubts in my partner. He was always very trustworthy, caring, kind, and loving. We rarely argue or fight and even when we have its been over minor things. I never saw any red flags and those in my personal life never did either. He was genuinely a great guy. 

Which is what made not just leaving hard. Weve been together for 6 years, and are we were set to be married in February. We have both invested so much time into this whole relationship as well as time and money into our wedding. So just ending things didnt feel that easy for either of us. 

We had been staying apart from each other to give us each time to cool down before discussing what this would mean for our potential to have a future together. 

We met this morning to discuss the situation/so I could ask him why he hid this and what he shocked me even more. 

I blatantly asked him why he had the procedure done and when he began having doubts about having kids. His response was that he never doubted having kids but started to doubt his ability to have one/get me pregnant. He followed this up by saying he never had the procedure and knew as little about them as I did. Instead he had apparently discovered he had a lower then average sperm count due to hormonal issues at a recent doctors appointment after he mentioned we had been trying without any luck. This appointment was in August. He brought paperwork detailing and proving this to our meeting as well. 

He told me he didnt know how to bring the topic up and mentioned that it made him feel embarrassed. And since he was told he wasnt infertile and that we may just have a harder time getting pregnant he said he was just hoping it would just eventually happen so he wouldnt have to say anything. He says he regrets hiding this, and regrets creating a lie to cover it, and I do forgive him. 

We did re discuss having kids to which he ensured me is something he still wants. I feel relief knowing his concern, words of encouragement, and comfort after every negative test was genuine as he did truly want them to be positive.

When I asked why he created the lie of having a vasectomy rather than just telling me about the fertility issues, it again went back to him saying he felt a sense of embarrassment about the issue. He said he thought saying he had this on purpose would save him the embarrassment of not being able to get me pregnant. He claims his inability to do so these last few months has made him doubt his masculinity and that by creating the idea that he purposefully chose to be sterile would make him seem like more of a man. 

While I dont fully understand this way of thinking, I guess I can slightly understand how these issues may have made him feel less than when he wasnt and shouldnt have felt that way. I offered him comfort and we discussed looking into medical interventions as well as just continuing to attempt to conceive naturally. 

Im not leaving my fiancé. Yes I was upset over his lie, but he deeply regrets it. We both still love each other, both still want to be married, and both still want kids. 

We will however be looking into attending individual and couples therapy to get over this. We are going to postpone the wedding since its only 4 months away, and Im the mean time keep trying to conceive naturally. We decided we will look into intervention methods after our wedding. 

I appreciate everyones advice on my last post, Thank you.

I will try to answer any further questions in the comments but hope this answers a majority of them/clears everything up. 

Thanks.","TrueOffMyChest",4175,4175,0,0.95,0,0,0,625

Hey y'all. Some of you may remember me as the volume eater who encouraged people to eat more low calorie stuff to feel full. Well, I have PCOS and some other chronic diseases, and with my poorly controlled diabetes (which is now back to pre diabetes levels), my menstrual cycle was a disaster, and my endocrinologist recommended weight loss to get pregnant but said that it'd still be a tough journey because most of my ovaries were covered in cysts.

Well, once I was at a healthy weight (I'm still technically overweight on BMI, but it's because of loose skin) and with lab values all normal, I got off the pill with the blessing from my three doctors, expecting it to take a long time to get pregnant.

7 weeks after getting off birth control, I got a positive pregnancy test. No treatments. No nothing. Just naturally pregnant. 

So uhh... Pretty cool effect.

Notice - i edited my post omitting many informations before posting coz it was more than 6000 characters. I will answer your questions in comments.

First of all, DH (30M) and I (29F) married for 9 years and we have 2 children (4F and 7month boy). We are each others first and only everything since we married young (we are from India if that helps you understand). First 2 to 3 years were all good. Eventually we learned that both of us had fertility issues. He had weak sperms and i was physically can't carry a child without endangering it. This started a series of relationship issues between us. My bestfriend Maha (29F) is very supportive of us at that time. I will be forever grateful for that. 

The problem is, his job requires a lot of travelling around India. When he goes onsite, i will go party around in some clubs here (we both are members and he knows i am going). On one such occasions 6 years ago, we had a fight about something that i don't remember now. I seriously considered leaving him as i am financially independent. Me and Maha attend a party in a club where i was very flirting around with dudes. Eventually one guy kissed me, it get very weird so i told him i am married. He yelled at me asking why i was flirting with him then and called security. Maha saw this. Security asked both of us to leave for the timebeing as they know i am a member.  Otw to my home, she starts telling me about how it is wrong and i should be ashamed. I agreed but begged her not tp tell my husband as he is very sensitive person. I promised her i would do better. 

I wanted to give our marriage a second chance. I changed but didn't told my husband about anything. Well yeah, i had a miscarriage but i gave birth to my children. I am also got promotion in my job and DH started his own business about the time our daughter born.

All of this brings us to now, Maha ended her relationship 5 months ago because her bf cheated on her with his coworker.  I was with her during this hard time. She told me now she feels how being cheated on hurts. She threatened me to come clean to DH about kissing other guy behind his back or she will tell him about that. If i told DH about this, divorce will be inevitable. And he is also too sensitive so i was afraid he would self harm himself. And i was worried about our kids. I begged her to reconsider her ultimatum but she won't budge. I sacrificed too many of my goals for this family. I rejected the promotion i am now when it was offered to me the first time (pregnant with first child). My career was in 3 years delayed because of this. Husband knows this and helped me a lot. 

After a few advices from another subreddit at that time, (i made that post like she is lying about me kissing other dude when she wasn't, for advice) i decided to go nuclear. I told my husband that she had a crush on him. She tried to set me up with other guy so she can have her evidence about me being a cheater so she could be with him. That guy forcefully kissed me, i shut him down. Now after her breakup with her bf she again started to blackmail me to leave him. She insists that our daughter is not his so i want a paternity test done on her before Maha starts to manipulate him. Now we both know our daughter looks exactly like his mother when she was a girl. So he told me that's not necessary and he knows i am not a cheater and he will handle my friend if she tries to 'manipulate' him. After this, i told Maha that my daughter isn't my DH's child. She doesn't know about my MIL's look on my daughter thing so she was furious. She told me she is going to tell my husband.

Well, DH shuts her down and called her out among our (me and Maha) friends. We told them the same version i told him. They believed us. Now all our work friends stopped talking/hanging out with her. She tried to secretly call our coworker Baviya in phone to hear our conversation as i didn't cave in in whatsapp. Thanks to the advice i got in reddit, i was prepared for this. I played with her emotions called her names for trying to steal my husband. Baviya later came to me to apologize for believing that i tried to cheat. With enough evidence against her harassing me, she was fired and i cut contact with her not before telling her not to break my family ever again (i was very careful with my words as she may record, you know). 

Now, i regret that it all came to this. I regret not believing in our marriage in the first place. I regret kissing a guy. I regret i had to paint my bestfriend as the villain of my story. I regret she was fired because of me. I regret not supporting her in her hardest time. But i don't regret twisting the truth to my husband. If he knows the truth, divorce is the only way and my perfect family will be ruined forever. 

You can call me wharever you want,  for kissing some guy, for lying to my husband,  for making my bff the villain, for 
getting her fired but know this, she was trying to break a happy family because someone in the family did one stupid (and small) mistake 6 years ago. She doesn't want DH to be in denial and he deserves to know the truth even if he commits suicide like wtf. Fuck off.

Only her and me know what actually happened, no evidences. Nobody will believe her and i won't say anything. I dont care what you gonna call me. Go ahead. But i build this family and i won't let anyone destroy it. 
Thank you

Throwaway
I (29F) married my husband (30M) in 2013. We have two children (4F and 10 month baby boy). My bestfriend had a crush on my husband ever since we married. We had some history between us because of that. She was very career motivated person and want to marry after her 30's. She was in love with her ex-bf for some time before she found that he cheated on her. She ended her relationship with him.

After that she told me she wanted to be with my husband. We had few fights about this. I told my husband about her crush on him. After that She told my husband that i cheated on him with some guy in a club (i didn't). My husband didn't believe any of this and had some harsh words to her. 

She was also fired from our workplace because she was harassing me on work hours. Her career took a pause because of this. Now she has to start from scratch in another company. She wasn't happy about this. Before leaving, she told my husband he will regret his words.

We haven't heard from her again. Two weeks ago her mother came to our house. She told us that my bestfriend committed suicide in christmas week last year. We are devastated. Regardless of the fight, she was my childhood bestfriend so i cried a lot. My husband reacted very poorly of this and has been very guilty for his harsh words towards her. He told me more than once that he is regretting his actions towards her when she was already in emotional stress. One time he asked me whether what my bestfriend said about me is true? That i cheated on him? I told him no firmly but deep down he seems to not believe me.

He talks to me only one or two words. When in work, he completely ignores me. Our workmates came to know about suicide and they are very sympathetic. But they know i am not at fault her neither do my husband. But still husband blames himself.

We doesn't have active sex life even before this. Normally only once or twice every month. He is always the one to initiate. But he is distant from me for past few days. I wanted to suggest therapy to him but i don't know how he will react to it. Any suggestions on how to deal with my husband.

// OP here, 
In the first post, OOP replied to as many comments as she can. However, she didn't reply to comments in the second post. Also, i can't find the original advice post she mentioned that she made in another account. Sorry //

TL;DR :- **OOP cheats on her husband during early stages of her marriage. Only her bff knows this but didn't tell the husband because OOP begged her not to. Now fast forward 6 years later, bff's boyfriend cheats on her. Now she knows how cheating hurts. So she gave OOP an ultimatum to come clean to her husband. OOP realizing there is no way her husband stay with her if she comes clean, decided to throw bff under the bus. She fabricates lies about bff, traps her with lies and makes her own family and friends against her. Bff goes no contact with OOP. This is where OOP wrote the first post admitting everything she did. In second post, bff committed suicide so OOP wrote the second post the same version of events she told her husband and her friends to make them against bff while expecting sympathy from internet**

We have been trying for over 8 years without luck - I tested fine for fertility but she has PCOS, an out of place ovary, chronic inflammation, along with other smaller issues.

An accident? We don't think so!","&gt;The parachutes of the Russian pilots shot down over Ukraine do not open. An accident? We don't think so!  
&gt;  
&gt;The other day a Russian Su-25 aircraft was shot down by the Ukrainian air defence system. The enemy pilot ejected, but died.  
&gt;  
&gt;The downed Russian pilot was one of many thousands of occupants who came ""to Ukraine"" and will remain forever in Ukrainian soil. However, this case has its own peculiarity and adds to the statistics of downed ""Putin's aces"" whose parachute did not open after ejection.  
&gt;  
&gt;A detailed study of the wreckage of this and earlier downed Russian fascist planes is under way, and preliminary results suggest that one of the reasons for the parachute not opening **might be that it was deliberately misfolded before takeoff**.  
&gt;  
&gt;At first glance this seems a paradoxical conclusion. However, following from the fact that Russian mothers, in order to satisfy geopolitical ambitions of the Kremlin dwarf Putin, have to deploy a truly Stakhanovite movement to give birth not to children, but to tanks, artillerymen and specialists of other military professions, many thousands of whom have become fertilizer for Ukrainian black soil, this option should not be completely ruled out.  
&gt;  
&gt;All the more so, each of the Russian pilots flying combat missions into the Ukrainian sky, killing Ukrainian women and children, destroying our cities with 500-kilogram bombs and missiles, which have a thousand-year history, is a war criminal according to international canons and will be sentenced to a long prison term. To hand such people over to justice and reveal the truth to the whole world is somehow not according to the Kremlin's rules. It is better for the pilot to have his parachute slightly ""adjusted"" before the flight by traditionally gray and inconspicuous special forces (heir of ""iron Felix"" and petty Putin).  
&gt;  
&gt;As they say - once and it's in the bag. I mean the pilot is in the ground and will not tell anybody anything. Russian women will give birth to many more babies. Not for the first time.

[**I Was Trapped into having a child**](https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/ju2kqh/i_was_trapped_into_having_a_child/) - submitted on 14 Nov 2020

I was advised to post this here, I also have not bonded to my kids.


Before me and my husband got married he knew I despised having children, I didn't want my body to be huge or take care of whiny children. Fast forward 1 year later and he's talking about having kids and that he's always wanted kids (didn't tell me this before getting married) and that I can even stay at home and he'll be the only one working so that I take care of the kids. I said no, I don't want the burden of a child for life, it would be too stressful for me, he said fine. A few months later while in bed he would rub my stomach a lot, which I didn't think much of then. I'm also not on birth control for mental reasons but we use condoms. One night I came home after work and had some drinks, we had sex that night I don't remember much but I do remember him going to the bathroom a lot. Everything was fine until the next morning I went to use our bathroom and I had a hunch to check out the condom from last night in the garbage and surely there were holes in them. 

I immediately started crying because I know I'm very fertile. My husband wakes up and sees me crying and I ask him why he poked holes in the condom, he instantly denied it and said it was a manufacturing error that he would never do ""such a thing"". I tell him if I'm pregnant I'm getting an abortion he agrees. That is until a few weeks later when I confirm I'm pregnant, he goes ""babe you can't have an abortion, you already had one with Another man before that's not healthy, I thought you were trying to be more Christian "", I was embarrassed because he was right &amp; it made me really upset because he was using my past abortion that was really difficult for me. So we ended up keeping it and my body does get huge = with fraternal twins. My pregnancy was awful and I was very depressed during that time, though my husband was very caring of course because this is what he wanted. And honestly I just wanted to be a good wife too.

Fast forward 2 years later, we now have a 2 year old boy &amp; girl, I had to quit my job because he refused to look after them, and now I'm a stay at home mom. I absolutely resent this, my kids won't leave me alone, I have no alone time there is constant whining and crying. I don't know what to do, I can't even go away for a while since he controls all the money :(. I don't know if I can do this anymore. 

TL;DR: Husband poked holes in condom while I was drunk, I wanted to get an abortion and he convinced me not to. All my fears came true and I am now stuck with 2 kids as a stay at home mom.

Your husband is a psychopathic abuser and a rapist, and you should divorce him ASAP.

[**Comment by OOP From Similar Post in relationship_advice**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/jtyg7j/husband_trapped_me_into_having_kids/gc8jczy/)

He told me he didn't want kids either before we got married. The night we had sex I was drunk unfortunately, we haven't had much sex after the kids were born. I want to separate but it's hard since he controls our finances and I don't work.

[**Update on: I Was Trapped Into having a child**](https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/ka7kzn/update_on_i_was_trapped_into_having_a_child/) - submitted on 10 Dec 2020

Hi Reddit community,  I first wanted to thank all of the helpful comments on my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/comments/ju2kqh/i_was_trapped_into_having_a_child/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf). 

It made me realize that what my husband did was in fact rape me but I tried to disassociate myself from those accusations at first. 

Also some people were asking why I didn't take birth control, I am sensitive to hormones and it makes me really depressed and moody - it's just terrible for me. 

I also wanted to provide a short update on the situation. 

I ended up looking at some divorce lawyers and telling my close friend about my situation. We made a plan while my husband was at work and as someone suggested to pack an ""escape bag"". I left a few weeks later in the afternoon to my friends house in another city. I also met the divorce lawyer there, discussed everything and it's looking really good for me. As for my kids I hired a babysitter (who was paid very well after) , for the day after my husband left for work and didn't tell him. 

He tried calling me multiple times, texting  me, and leaving voice messages. I did my best to ignore them. He's gotten the message and knows about me filing for divorce, and he keeps texting me to talk and telling me our kids miss their ""mommy"". I feel really really bad, I haven't decided if I should keep my kids or leave them to him. 

I am a little worried because he hasn't suspend me from using his debit card, I fear he may try to track me that way to guilt trip me in person =.

Overall I'm just relived to be my own person again, I am still looking for work but my friend has been really supportive an amazing about this with letting me stay with her for a while. Thank you all for the help!

Thanks for the advice. He's being obsessive and making new numbers everyday to message me. I wouldn't put it past him to make up something like that to lure me back. I fear I couldn't go back to get my kids even if I wanted to as I belive he's brainwashed the babysitter into believing I'm a terrible mother because she's not answering my texts, I'm not sure it's worth the risk right now. He just wants me back home with him and the kids like nothing ever happened.

Please stop. I'm aware of my actions and the damage that will inevitably be done by it. I already said I blame myself for all of this, but I need this break right now to clear my mind and decide my kid's future. Maybe I can take care of them once the divorce is final and I get a job plus my mental health gets better; but it's not really ideal right now for me to look after them and all they'll see is their mom crying all the time. Like I said they're fine with there father right now, he was never abusive to them.

[**AITA for telling everyone to leave me the fuck alone?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/u4dshw/aita_for_telling_everyone_to_leave_me_the_fuck/)

I (25F) have a 6 month old son. His father is deceased, his fathers family dont want anything to do with him and my own family (minus my dad) have told me that they dont want anything to do with him either.

Ive read and heard enough to know that I shouldnt expect anyone to help me and that my kid is my own responsibility so thats how Ive been dealing with everything.

I work from home so I dont really need a babysitter for work or anything either.

Im okay tbh. Im still dealing with grief and Im kind of lonely but every time I talk to anyone they always remind me that they dont want to deal with a baby. For example: I sent my sister a funny post and before reacting to the post she sent me a warning text saying that this doesnt mean shell babysit. I DIDNT EVEN MENTION MY SON???

Everyone does this to me, my mother, sisters, friends. They also act like I made a mistake for not terminating after my bf passed so yeah, Id rather be lonely.

We have a family group chat and although I dont bother texting on there after my sisters told me not to send any pics of my son because nobody cares except me, I do read their conversations to feel something idek.

Well idk how they didnt realize I was in the GC because you know-FAMILY GC-but they were talking about how they have a surprise party planned for my birthday and I lost it. I burst into tears and immediately called my sister who was with the rest of the family.

I asked them what they were trying to accomplish after making me feel like shit for almost a year. She told me to stop being dramatic but I just kept going. I asked her and the rest of my family why they thought that Id appreciate the party after months of them not talking to me or my baby. My mom told me that she just wanted me to realize how difficult being a single mother is but I told her to shut up. I then told them all to leave me the fuck alone and dont bother with the surprise party. One sister called me a bitch and the others laughed at me saying that Im being hysterical and overly dramatic and they definitely werent doing the party now or at least until I apologize.

I dont want to apologize though. I dont think Im the AH but my sisters and mother say that Im overreacting and that this is exactly why I dont have any friends. They say Im the AH. My dad found out about everything and came over last night and told me to ignore everyone but I cant stop thinking about this. AITA?

Edit:

My bfs family is very religious and dont like the fact that I had a baby out of wedlock.

My 2 sisters are in their mid-late thirties and dont have children for whatever reason. They were supportive when my bf (no I didnt steal him from anyone) was alive but did make a few off comments about how fertile/young I am and how theyre not etc etc. I dont know why they switched up and thats also why I lost it.

My parents are divorced and my father is not in the gc. Its my sisters, mother and step father. Im sorry, shouldve made this clear.

[**UPDATE: AITA for telling everyone to leave me the fuck alone?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v3cc3q/update_aita_for_telling_everyone_to_leave_me_the/)

Wow. I have never felt so supported and loved in a very long time. I wasnt even going to post anything but Im so happy I did.

I dont know how to explain just how big of an impact everyones comments and dms had on me. It was so lovely. Thank you so much for all the offers of friendship, and more.

So as of a few weeks ago, I moved in with my father. Being alone with my son had me going crazy. The loneliness was literally killing me. I needed help and I am no longer ashamed to admit it. My dad made the offer.

I work Mon-Fri and have the weekends off and well Ive been following everyones advice and signed up for a mommy and me thing nearby. It was nerve wrecking but so many moms were so friendly and came up to me themselves. I got three numbers and theyre all inviting me to a dinner party. Theyre really sweet despite being at least 5 years older than me. Theyve sort of adopted me lol (their words not mine).

Im also going for walks after work. My dad and son come along sometimes. Me and my dad also cook together and we make some pretty neat stuff for his girlfriend who has also been really kind.

As for my mother and sisters, I still dont know why they dislike me and my baby so much. But I took that step and left the GC. This might sound ridiculous but it was really hard. I even shed a tear. But I did it. They havent spoken to me since.

I contacted my in laws one last time. Idk why but his parents said they were willing to meet. They wont try and take him from me but my dad got me a lawyer just in case. Im meeting them this weekend and depending on how it goes, I will let them see my son eventually.

Finally, I saw a doctor and Ive been diagnosed with PPD. Im currently seeing a therapist that was recommended to me and have started a treatment plan. My son, father and his gf have been my biggest supporters and Im trying to be better for me but them as well. Ive also been missing my fiancé a lot these days but his memory is kind of calming. Idk.

It hasnt been very long but Im already seeing improvements in my life. Its crazy how making my original post kickstarted this change. Thank you so very much for everything.

She's the oldest in our family and I (32f) am the youngest. 10 years ago I learned I was pregnant for the first time. It was a little unexpected but my husband and I were so excited and we told our families. Beth was a mom of two at the time. Two days after my first US I started bleeding heavily, ended up passing out and discovered I had lost the baby. I called and told my family. My parents and siblings decided to come and see me. While I was on the phone with Beth she told me she was pregnant and wanted to tell everyone to make the bad news easier, and would I prefer for her to wait until they had left the hospital or would I like her to say it there. I told her I would appreciate her waiting until they weren't in my room. Even after asking me herself she showed up and announced to the family around my hospital bed and made a big deal out of hugging every person there in celebration. The rest of the family looked shell shocked and our sister closest in age to me, Chlo, asked if I was okay and asked if I wanted them to kick her out. I was too depressed to answer.

A couple of years later I was diagnosed as infertile because I could not conceive again, even after we started trying. I told my family as a heads up because it got me down and I was trying to come to terms. Beth's words were ""That's aright because I'm pregnant"". Cue even more shock from the family and them scolding her for saying anything even remotely close to that.

I'm now pregnant thanks to IVF and a of help from fertility doctors and my wonderful OB. We kept quiet on our journey with IVF, our families knew we planned to pursue it but we didn't give regular updates in case it failed, and waited until we got the positive pregnancy test to confirm. Babies were safe and still alive after my first scan and we decided that was the time for us. During a regular family dinner we made the announcement. Nobody knew it was coming. But during the announcement Beth jumps in and says she believes she could be pregnant again (she wasn't) and wanted everyone to know.

Chlo, my SIL (brother's wife) and BIL (other brother's husband) are throwing my shower. I told them I didn't want to invite Beth. That I feared she would try to turn it into her celebration or make more insensitive comments. They all understood and said they agreed. Beth found out I was having a shower and tried to find out info. She was told that info was not being given out. Then she tried to corner Chlo, who told her that she, SIL and BIL had decided not to invite her (Beth) since she seemed to be unable to be compassionate to me or let me have a moment after a decade of struggling to have a baby). Beth then approaches me and I told her I didn't want her there. She told me she's my sister and I'm being childish and petty about it. Her husband then called me and said I was punishing Beth for having kids easily when I couldn't.

I have always had a childfree mindset from very early childhood, but at one point a friend brought up that she had just signed up to be an egg donor. It seemed pretty simple for my part, you just sign up, a person or couple picks you, then you go donate eggs and voila! They would be able to have their very own baby, I would feel good about helping with that, as well as a few thousand dollars in compensation.

A few months after signing up I was chosen by a nice couple from halfway across the world. Everything seemed great in the beginning. There was an initial screening where I had to travel to their clinic, do an interview and have a ultrasound type test done to be sure I was a viable candidate. 

Initially when they contacted me to give me the details; they explained that I'd come down to their clinic for 2 weeks, I would be given some medication to make me produce a lot more eggs in a cycle than usual. Then they would bring me in, harvest the eggs and let me go home to rest. Cool, I could do that - I informed my employer that I would have to take off for that time ( since the clinic was several provinces over, I'd have to fly and stay for the duration ). My boss was ok with it and said they could accommodate me.

Some of my friends and family did some research on their own and came to me with concerns. Apparently the medication they put the donor on would very likely have some lasting side effects, some were just like regular PMS symptoms but others reported extreme weight gain, permanent mental health damage and other serious illnesses like increased chance of cancer and.. death.. So obviously they had concerns, and told me to ask the doctors and staff at the donation clinic.

When I brought up my concerns to the egg donation doctor and staff, they became annoyed with me right away. They brushed off my concerns and instead kept bringing up the couple - didn't I realize how much they would be going through as well? Didn't I realize how much money they were spending to do this? It made me feel very uneasy, I just wanted to talk about what the possible downsides are for me and how we might be able to mitigate it. They didn't seem to care about my concerns at all, more that I should care about the donors being able to have a baby and get their money's worth. I was to donate eggs to this nice couple and should be grateful to do so.. I was still uneasy but brushed off my own worries for now.

Eventually, I got my period and contacted them. The conversation was something like ""I'm ready, should I tell my employer I will be away for two weeks starting tomorrow?"" and they got annoyed with me again.  She said "".. you could be here for 8 weeks or more. Everyone is different.."" and I started to back off really quick, I explained that so far they only ever mentioned only 2 weeks, never any longer. I would never be approved to take that much time off work..  At that point they got very aggressive, but it was all about the recipient couple, and the money they were spending on this. They kept asking me how I would feel if I had spent all this money and the donor backed off at the last minute, and don't you realize how much they are spending on this? It was weird, I tried to explain that I wasn't comfortable, as they made it seem like there was no possible side effects on my part that were worth worrying about, and that I would only have to be away for 2 weeks, all of it was extremely misleading. At this point I told that I wasn't going to go through with it at all. It was too many lies and they were basically yelling at me to come do this donation, completely invalidating my concerns.. 

At this point she calmed down a little and said ""Ok then, I'm going to have the couple contact you, and you can explain to them why they won't be having a baby."" I was gutted, I really did feel bad for them, I knew that this would probably be crushing as I figured they'd been trying to have a baby for a long time. That must have really been hard for them, I think anyone with fertility issues should seriously consider adopting, I personally can't imagine putting myself through something like that just to have a halfway biological child, when you can adopt an unwanted child who is already here and needs a loving family.

The donation clinic staff continued to harrass me for sometime after this, they called me a lot, left many of voicemails and texts. Some threatened legal action while others just tried to make me feel shame for not going through with it. I ignored them all and eventually had my friend pick up and say they had the wrong number. They eventually stopped, I hope the couple found what they were looking for in the end.

 Honestly if my family and friends weren't so supportive, I probably would have caved and went do to the donation. I'm very glad for them because looking back, it was super weird and they didn't care at all about what negative effects it might have on me, I was just a walking egg donator and they just wanted to get me all jacked up on meds and harvest a bunch of my eggs, no matter the cost to my personal health, employment or life.

I hope this can be a tale of caution to someone who is considering being a donor or for anyone who did it and was treated more or less like an egg factory. Do your research and don't be afraid to back out of any situation you are not comfortable in, at any point you can withdraw, you should never feel forced to go through with a medical procedure if you don't want to.

I sat there in shock for A moment trying to process how this couldve happened how and why so quickly, just everything. 

After I was able to gain a slight amount of composure I started asking questions come to find out she hasnt gone to the hospital in two months so after she found out she was pregnant she didnt go to the hospital since. 
I asked her why she didnt tell me that she was pregnant for so long simply responded with I knew my body and I just wanted to make sure everything was okay beforehand 

I asked her how she just didnt tell me all that time and was perfectly fine with it and all she said was I just told you and carried on looking at the pregnancy test. 

I responded under the heat of the moment  well if you wouldve just told me then maybe I couldve helped and this wouldnt have happened to say regretted what I said was an understatement I know how that sounded but that is genuinely not what I meant to come out like it was simply under the heat of the moment while I was still trying to understand everything that was going on. 

Right after she asked how Im blaming this on her and I tried  to explain thats not what I meant and that came out so wrong  but she ignored me grabbed some of her random belongings and left 
 she was gone for two weeks and I tried to call around and see where she was at but no answers.

I found out that she has been staying at my in-laws' house for the past two weeks. I tried talking to her multiple times explaining thats not what I meant I was under the heat of the moment and that this is an entire misunderstanding.

She said she  just couldnt get what I said out of her head and asked me to leave. 

A week after that I come home to divorce papers on the table and a shit ton of her belongings packed out. 
I know that what I said was wrong but i did not mean it I tried taking it back I tried explaining to her that thats not what I meant I dont think that is her fault but I was just confused so many times. I know that this is wrong but I feel like this was completely blown out of proportion for a genuine misunderstanding I have gone above and beyond to try to explain this but she just wont listen again I understand that it was an asshole thing to say but under the circumstances, I wasnt in the right state of mind. she was holding the test she took when she found out she was pregnant

EDIT- alright yall crazy people heres some adds. 1.no im not abusive wether yall Believe it or not2. No i HIGHLY doubt my wife lied about her pregnancy. 3. I am going to try to get some answers as you guys have brought up some valid points. 4. Ill update when I find new info. 5.

Mood: &gt;!wholesome!&lt;


ORIGINAL POST: 

Im pregnant by my friend after a ONS. Were both still reeling after our partners cheated on us with each other.

Okay, this is a doozy so please bear with me, Im trying to make sense of it myself.

My ex-husband (36M) and I (38F) were friends with another couple, Larry (fake name, 36M) and Kate (fake name, 36F). 

Recently, Larry and I started to work jobs that require us to be away from home on evenings. My ex and Kate started to hang out when we couldnt be there: dinners, taking the dogs out for walks, shows, etc.

Larry and I were relieved that they were getting along and keeping each other from being lonely. But you know what happens next: Kate and my ex announced during what was a nice dinner at their house that they had fallen in love and wanted to divorce us. 

The fallout was awful. Larry kicked Kate out, I kicked my ex out, and they both got somewhere to live together. I was inconsolable, catatonic at most times, and only therapy and my familys support got me through. I filed for divorce before ex could and that is now underway. 

Larry and I clung to each other a bit, as the other knew what the other felt and vice versa. Since I live close to work and he is working remotely, he basically moved in the guest bedroom, going to his flat only for a few things and watering the plants. Hes planning on selling it and is having it surveyed. 

We had a very platonic relationship, and even though Im older, he felt like my big brother even before this mess. 


Anyway, valentines comes around and we decided to get pissed and commiserate. He showed me a necklace he had bought for Kate for their anniversary. Its a custom design and took a couple of months to be completed. Its gorgeous and I told him so.

He said he forgot about it, until he got the email saying it was dispatched a month ago. He cant force himself to get rid of it and I understood. I still have my wedding rings in my drawer.

I dont know who made the first move, but it happened and we slept together that night. We couldnt look at each other the next morning and he moved back to his flat.

I was very sad and locked myself away again, hating myself for letting it get so far. We didnt talk or text for a couple of weeks. I thought I lost a really good friend.

He came around one night with dinner and flowers, asking for forgiveness that it happened. He blamed himself and I told him it was both our mistake. We both decided to forget it happened and carry on.

He came around often again, but never staying the night. 

Three weeks ago, I started to feel dizzy and nauseous at work. I thought it had something to do with my new medication so I set up an appointment with my GP. Long story short, we found Im pregnant.

So here I am, scared and anxious to tell Larry. I want to keep the baby as I have always wanted to be a mother but I dont want to lose him if I do. Weve just gotten our equilibrium back.

UPDATE: 

Im pregnant by a friend after a ONS. Were both still reeling after our partners cheated on us with each other

First off, thank you so much for the advice and replies, I read the all, even the ones that were denouncing me for baby trapping Larry.

To be clear, my ex and I wanted children and started to try when I hit 30. Issues on both sides made it clear we cant have any naturally so we saved up for a few rounds of IVF before discussing adopting. I do have a good, stable job and with the money I saved up (even if half of it goes to ex after the divorce), bean and I will be set for a while. My mother has been over the moon about the new grandbaby and has made plans to retire and help me should I find myself a single mother. 

Anyway, a couple of days after I posted, I invited Larry for dinner. I declined alcohol, which had his eyebrow raising but I dont drink if Im working the next day and he knows this. 

I told him after dessert, and yes, he was stunned. Im on birth control due to PCOS and yes, BC fails too. I told him straight up I dont expect anything from him, but he should know as it was his child too. I wanted to keep bean and he can be involved or not as much as he wants.

He was quite concerned about my health, and besides a bit of sickness and dizziness here and there, Im mainly all right. He nods and tells me he needs to go home and think. I agree and told him to call me when he feels hes ready.

Three days later, he tells me hes coming over, and he brings a couple of suitcases with him. He declares hes moving in and helping with the pregnancy, baby and all. I laughed until I was crying but I will admit it was a relief and joy to know the father wants to be involved.

Weve sat down, hashed a lot of boundaries, agreements, and expectations of the whole thing. Were going to a lawyer so we can settle the contract. I am confident he just wants best for the bean and I. He offered to buy the exs half of the house so we could all stay here. 

Hes settled in his room, my library/office is being turned into a nursery. He offered to convert the shed as the new library for my birthday when he could see I was crying over where to put my books.

I have no romantic expectations of him and I suspect he feels the same. I get more hugs and forehead kisses though, which is nice. And its lovely to have someone rub your back and pull your hair away when youre sick. 

We get to go together on my next appointment with the doctor. Too early to say the gender yet though!

""So magicians don't actually build towers?""

""No, they do. Back in the early days, they were everywhere. It was a rite of passage; each magician would build their tower on their own, forming it into the purest expression of their understanding of magic. All the knowledge they accumulated would be stored within. But after the Mage Wars and the Dust Rebellion, most realized they were nothing but targets. So they changed where they were built.""

""The in... Incar...""

""The Mental Incarnation Theorem. The great mages of the time pooled together their knowledge, and created a way to take something physical and store it in their mental landscape. They carried their towers with them. Later generations improved the theorem, to the point they created the tower entirely in their minds. They were no longer able to physicalize their towers, but instead tied their magic to it's foundations, making them immensely powerful. This lead to the Tower model we have today. Every mage builds their tower to be incredibly sturdy, because if you destroy a mage's Tower...""

""You destroy their magic!""  
&amp;nbsp;

Dave smiled. The young elves were a joy to teach. They listened attentively, they asked questions, and most importantly... They didn't care he was human. Or that he was a First - a one-floor mage. The chimes rang, indicating the time for lessons was over. Eylas was currently his only student, and based on the cold looks her parents had been handing him recently, soon he wouldn't even have that. Eylas stood up, and prepared to head out. Dave looked down to pack his things, when...

""I'm sorry."" Dave looked up. Eylas' smile was gone. Instead, she looked nervous and sad. ""I heard Father talking to the elder last night. He said-""

Dave interrupted her. ""Nothing nice, I'm sure. You don't need to repeat it, it's nothing I haven't heard before. I'm a human teacher in the Elven Protectorate after all.""

She nodded. ""I wanted to thank you for everything. I've never enjoyed classes, but you made everything so interesting! I want to hear more about the towers, and the Dust War, and magic! The other teachers are just so... so... boring! It's only theory and discussions about discussions, and why one of them was wrong! It's so... boring.

Dave smiled gently. ""They care about the who and the what, not the how or the why. Never stop asking questions Eylas. You were one of my best students, and I'll miss our classes. You should hurry home; I'm sure the elder is-""

""Right here,"" a cool voice informed him from the doorway. Eylas made a guilty start, and hurried past Dave, head down. The elder let her through, then stared emotionlessly at Dave. ""You know what I'm about to say... Dusty.""

Dave hadn't twitched at that term in years. ""I'll leave tonight."" The elder didn't acknowledge him further, and left. Dave looked at the sun. It was nearly noon. He would need to leave immediately to make it out of the forest and into Meadowland before dark. Not even 15 minutes later, he was on the road.  
&amp;nbsp;

Not even 15 minutes after that, he was surrounded.  
&amp;nbsp;


Eight Elves, all Thirds or higher. Despite surrounding Dave, they talked amongst themselves like he wasn't there. ""Shame about the last Dusty. He didn't last that long."" ""One less human won't matter, they breed like rabbits anyways."" ""Good riddance I say. A disgrace to magic. How many years, and still a First? I'd offer myself as fertilizer to the Mother Tree before I hit 200.""

Dave only sighed, and set down his pack. The elves all turned to him now, eyes gleaming. One of them spoke. ""You humans killed so many of my ancestors in your rebellion. This is just justice, Dusty."" At that, by some unspoken agreement, they all started to cast a spell. Dave looked at them. Looked up at the peaceful trees. He raised his hand and snapped his fingers.

Space solidified around them. Everything went silent. Then everything went dark.  
&amp;nbsp;  

&amp;nbsp;

The last elf was on the ground, gasping and bleeding. The others had died in the magical darkness, trapped in by the walls of Force. He was terrified. All magicians could inherently see the Towers of others, and the man in front of him was clearly a First, and the weakest variety at that. His Tower was already capped, and couldn't be built any higher. So why was his magic so terrifying? ""How..."" He croaked at Dave.

Dave only shook his head. The elf looked on in horror as his view of the tower shifted. The 'ground' fell away... revealing the rest of his Tower.

""Who said you could only build your towers up?""  
&amp;nbsp;

------
AN: I've had this idea rattling around in my head for a long, long time now. It all came about from brainstorming interesting magic systems while bored at work. This one really grabbed me - everyone hears about the mage towers trope, but in a world of mages, there could never be enough space for that! The ""building a Tower into the ground"" idea wasn't actually what I wanted to do at first - he was going to build a pyramid instead. But that would need so much time, and I'm not ready to write a novel, thank you very much. Hope you all enjoyed, this was a lot of fun to write.


EDIT: Uh, holy crap everyone. I just woke up and I'm blown away by the response this got.  Thank you all so much for everything... Especially for the help in expanding the world. It means so much to me that people like this enough to pick at it and expand on the idea.","HFY",3166,3166,0,0.99,7,1,1,158

I appreciate all the information you've given me about writing on Reddit, pollinators, legal matters, and invasive honeysuckle. You didn't waste your time, because I did pay attention. I have to sleep now because dawn comes really early and foster puppies don't care that I got into a Reddit loop. Peace to you all. 

Edited to appease the Reddit Editorial Board.

I don't think I'm an A, but I am open to other Points Of View. 
When my neighborhood was built, it pretty much ruined the natural flora and fauna. I'm no botanist, but existing farmland, trees cut down, all green gone, animals gone. The soil is useless hard clay. I hate it, but It Is What It Is. Anyway. 
My backyard is big, and I hate lawns. I built a subsistance farm and converted front yard into clover. While the clover was not in direct violation of the HOA rules, it was frowned upon, by the concerned looks from neighbors and the cars slowing down by my house. I Dont Really Care. Everyone violates rules here.

To try to mitigate some of the damage done, I do everything I can to attract pollinators, especially bees and birds. I planted a whole ton of honeysuckle. From training and soil fortification, it has taken off. The smell and the vines, the hummingbirds and the bees, listening to them when they come around are heaven for me. 

Dear Husband and I are respectful, introverted neighbors. We only socialize if our kids force us to. 

Old neighbors didnt care. New neighbors (NNs) move in with two kids. About three months later, New Neighbor wife knocks at my door. She introduces herself and tells me all about her and her family (unsolicited, by the w). While talking, she looks at the honeysuckle draped over my porch. 

New Neighbor wife, Out Of The Blue, ""you know, New Neighbor husband could help your Dear Husband take all those vines down."" 

What The Fudge? Me: ""Why?"" 

New Neighbor wife ""because it's honeysuckle. Honeysuckle attracts bees."" 

Me: ""yes ma'am. I planted it for that reason. And the hummingbirds."" 
New Neighbor wife: ""You want bees in your yard?"" 

Me: ""Yes ma'am. And birds. They're important for fertilizing this area. I'm pretty proud of the progress."" 

Obviously everything I say from this point on is making her uncomfortable. But... my porch and my yard and she invited herself on it to talk to me like this. 

New Neighbor wife: ""Well, New Neighbor daughter is deathly allergic to bees. We have to travel everywhere with an Epi-pen. You have to stop attracting bees to your yard."" 

Me: ""Ma'am, I am sorry to hear about New Neighbor daughter's situation, but no ma'am. The world is filled with bees, and wrecking the vegetation in my yard to possibly prevent bees from coming near here is futile."" Yep really said that. 

New Neighbor wife stated that if New Neighbor daughter gets stung she could die and it'll be my fault. New Neighbor wife tells me how having weeds in my lawn is unkempt and lazy and New Neighbor wife'll be talking to the HOA to report me.
Me: ""You'd best run on home fast before a bee starts chasing you.""
Dear Husband thinks I could have been nicer, but To Be Fair, he doesn't care about the clover or the honeysuckle. He does worry they could have a legal case against us should New Neighbor daughter get stung near our house. I have not talked to a lawyer, but surely I can't be sued for not harnessing bees?

No fence, per the HOA. Maybe ""Beware of bees"" signs at the edge of our yard? Slightly concerned that New Neighbor wife may 'help' us trim the honeysuckle (nowhere near New Neighbor wife's yard). Thank God I Work From Home and we have cameras all around. 
For What It's Worth, New Neighbor wife's house is about 300' awayp. 
Reddit, AITA?

Other edits:
- thank you for combing through my post to find where I misused a semi colon (or colon?). It's been a long day, for unrelated reasons, so I welcome your Reddit education. Yall are serious about this stuff and I mean no disrespect. 

- the honeysuckle was literally dug up from one location in the southwest of a southeastern state in the US and moved to the southeast of that same state, not two hours away. I didn't buy it online to take over the world. I promise.

- the same exact honeysuckle is growing on fences and sides of houses not 5 miles from my house I live in now. I'm not introducing something that isn't already here and I'm not letting it encroach anywhere near land that's not ours. Thanks for your concern.","AmItheAsshole",3166,3166,0,0.96,2,1,1,929

I literally do not know what to do. This is long, **TL;DR** at bottom.

My wife and I have been married for 3 years, together for 6. She's always been one of the most amazing people I've ever met. No huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. That's why this is so difficult for me.

We've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years. She's in marketing and I work independently as an IT consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible. We decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time. We've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

Long story short, I was diagnosed with azoospermia last December. Blockage in the pipes just meant I wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. It's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this July. She's got a high sex drive as do I, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way I could have gotten her pregnant.

She missed her period this week. I couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right? The babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out. She took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

At first I was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. She's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. I'm not the jealous type, but I'm literally stuck. The doctors said this couldn't happen. And I can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

My wife's been ecstatic. She's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. She was so excited when she first found out that I didn't express my worries then. But she left for work and now I feel completely torn. What if she did cheat?

Looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues. Her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. She definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. She always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different. I remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

Fuck man I don't know what to do. I set up an appointment on Monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine. If it is mine and I accuse her of cheating I feel like the world's biggest asshole. But she's coming home in a few hours and I don't know what I'm going to say to her, I can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and I just didn't see it.

Do I wait until the doctor appointment Monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? I'm worried I won't be able to hide what's going on.

**TL;DR: Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine. Want to wait until Monday, but don't think I can hide it. What do I tell her?**

**Edit:** I should add I've been cheated on before. Our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now. I'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**Edit** I really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past. My wife's coming home though in an hour and I have to decide if I'm going to put on a happy face until Monday or not.

**Edit** She texted saying she's going be home late

This is bringing up some old emotional scars I think and is just fucking with me. I'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward. I think I need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

**TL;DR:** Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update **TL;DR** at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar. I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart. I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while. It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on. My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away. It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing. A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it. I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer. I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

""You know I'm not Ashley, right?""

She knows me well. Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized. I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner. What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while. I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty. She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex. She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that. She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off. I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her. Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head. Maybe I'm just being paranoid. Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to. But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia. I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help. I feel like I just got more uncertainty.

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night. We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning. I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off. I really couldn't put my finger on it. We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus. We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand. This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before. And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again? I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself. But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off. Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think I could be fertile. Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go. Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

UPDATE: I've been trying to center myself. We talked calmly for a bit on the phone. She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits. I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home. I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not. Thankfully she's not working late today.

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE: I went for a long run to clear my mind. Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home. I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them. Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

[**Final and happy update - posted three years ago**](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c2grcq/happy_update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for/)

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities. I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted. But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night. I told her everything that was going on. The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment. I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized. She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me. She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly. And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't. We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it. Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment. She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back. She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields. It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture. It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait. I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page. After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed. We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend. I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me. That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real. I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all. This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together. I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything. Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this. It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**TL;DR Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything. We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.**

UPDATE: The paternity test came back intially positive for anyone that's going to see this : )

**Am I the asshole for not telling my ex I got pregnant?**

I (28 F) was with my ex-husband for about 6 years. During this time, we were trying for a baby but had no success.

About 4 years into our marriage, our marriage had a rough patch. My ex had stress had work and slept with his coworker to relieve it. He confessed to me rather quick and a week later, they sat me down and told me they were expecting a child.

I was an idiot back then and so I felt like I should forgive him because I truly believed he loved me and I thought I had no one.

It wasnt. My exs family treated me like their own, but my exs supposed daughter was the apple of their eye. As a result of that, my exs coworker was frequent presence in our lives. They felt like they had to include the mom of their grandchild for everything too and she made her way in every family picture and memory. It didnt help that I suspected that the coworker had feelings for my ex and flirted with him when she can.

People thought that she was my exs wife constantly and I finally had enough when during the baby girls first birthday party when I was told to take a picture of my ex, his mistress, his daughter, and his parents and it didnt include me. It hit me that I was now treated as the other woman and I realized that I deserved more than this bullshit. I filed for divorce a few months later and left. It was the hardest time of my life but I ended up getting a promotion at work and met this sweet, wonderful guy.

Fast forward to now, me and my boyfriend are madly in love and I gave birth to an adorable baby girl that I considered a miracle baby. I got pregnant with my boyfriend like 3 months after dating him and I thought that it was strange that this could happen since my previous failed attempts with ex and had thought that I was the infertile one. It crossed my mind then that maybe he was the infertile one and he only believed mistress was pregnant with his child because they were having an affair. I didnt say anything though because it was not my place anymore.

However, my boyfriend was so happy about my daughters birth and posted it on Facebook and tagged me in the post. I was still friends with my ex SIL on FB and she saw the post. She called me up and said that she was hurt that I didnt let her know that I could actually get pregnant and the lack of child during my first marriage could be my exs fault. He took a paternity test.

The poor baby girl was NEVER my exs. The coworker apparently was dating this terrible guy during the time she slept with my ex and didnt know who the childs father was so she just strung my ex along cause she had feelings for him and thought hed be the best father for her child.

Now my ex blames me for not telling him that I was pregnant way before and him having to father this girl. Hes doing pretty bad now and I cant help but feel guilty like I shouldve told him.

**EDIT:** I didnt realize that I could edit my post even after the 3000 character limit.

Okay so first of all, I keep seeing that people have seen other posts like mine and some youtube video (??). If so, Im upset that others have had similar situations as me and that some people find the situation so hilarious that they make a video out of it. Ive also never posted on reddit before (I had a previous account for browsing not posting).

I dont think I have to prove my story and I honestly posted this not to seek validation that my ex supposedly is the worst ever, but to gain perspective since my ex and his family were MY family and close confidantes for a large period of my life. We were pretty close and I had promised to keep in touch after the divorce (which they were super upset about), but I really couldnt after everything that happened between us. Theyre now super pissed at me for the divorce and for being complicit in my ex taking on the expenses of his not-daughter and forming a paternal connection with her for longer than he shouldve.

**EDIT:** So heres whats been happening right now, I havent spoken to them after this and have been avoiding my exs calls. He texted me saying that he is sorry and overreacted and felt guilty about prioritizing people who were never really family over me. I only replied with asking how his daughter is because even though she isnt biologically his, shes still his girl. She seems like an adorable kiddo and adores her dad :(. My exs mistress is able to support the girl financially so my ex wont contribute to that but he says that hes still going to see her every month because he feels morally obligated to. I feel bad for the girl so much because she seems to have lost her family unit (dad, grandparents, cousins).

**Judgment:** NTA

&gt;A note on the infertility: I always assumed that it was me who was infertile because I had incidents in college where I didnt use protection a couple of times (very irresponsible and highly not recommended) and nothing came out of it. At the time, I believed I was extremely lucky, but when trying to get pregnant, I thought of the incident as proof that I was the infertile one and had led my ex to believe as such. Him supposedly getting his coworker pregnant strengthened my belief. We were actually going to go to a fertility clinic before we got the news about his coworker, but that never ended up happening.  
&gt;  
&gt;Side note: Thank you for all the kind words :)

[Top Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h83lq5/comment/fuoq184/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3):

&gt;NTA - first of all, what the fuck - your ex cheats on you and blames you for him taking on fatherhood for a child that is not his?  
&gt;  
&gt;What a - I am not going to say it, because this comment will be removed.  
&gt;  
&gt;sorry - no rough patch justifies cheating, he should have taken up counselling. He fucked her, he cheated, he should have considered the possibility, that she is fucking other guys, too.  
&gt;  
&gt;The only one he can blame is the woman who forced that child onto him and himself.  
&gt;  
&gt;Don't feel bad, you don't need to be mad at your ex, but you sure as hell need to grow up and be mad at the audacity, that he is trying to make you the bad one here.  
&gt;  
&gt;It's great you still get along with your Ex's family, but ma dude, he made his bed, cheating with his coworker - who was already in bed with another man - now he can lie in it and take care of alimony suits or whatever his plan is.  
&gt;  
&gt;I hope he can figure out something, because that child considers him her dad already - but hell, that woman stole years from him.  
&gt;  
&gt;EDIT: Wow - thanks kind stranger, for the gold, I am a sporadic user on reddit so I haven't quite figured out the awards yet - but I did NOT expect this to go through the roof like it did.I try to comment, like I would comment on a friend's problem they confide in me. Thanks again.  
&gt;  
&gt;And also want to make clear, yeah the last sentence was a bit hard to understand - I do still think it was entirely EXs fault and he got all he deserved and more; however I also see another issue here, the fact of slipping another human being a fast one; in this case a baby and playing on their good faith, suggesting it is their child.EX was at least '!decent!' enough to take on responsibility for the child he thought was his. He played OP and got played in turn. This is a fuck fest and the child is the only one loosing here.

[Another Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h83lq5/comment/fuoqqhk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3):

&gt;Nta. Your ex cheated, you moved on. He has now abandoned the lady that drove a wedge in your relationship because she was sleeping with another when you were married to him. He is TA. His life choices are in no way your fault. Cut him out.  
&gt;  
&gt;Congratulations for moving on. Go and enjoy your new family. New man sounds like he is going to be a much better father.

[**UPDATE: AITA for not telling my ex I got pregnant**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ilyfhs/update_aita_for_not_telling_my_ex_i_got_pregnant/)

I got messages asking me to update and Im now frequently on Reddit so I thought why not?

First things first, Im getting married! My boyfriend proposed a few weeks ago and well be tying the knot once this whole mess of a year is over.

I know a lot of people here said that my exs family is toxic and I shouldnt keep in touch with them, but I did contact them to tell them about my engagement, eek!

It went.. well. My ex-MIL cried and told me she was happy for me and apologized for everything. She felt bad about what happened and promises to keep in touch with me. My ex-SIL also apologized for blowing up at me but she was just very overwhelmed by everything going on in her familys life. I can sympathize and told her that all is forgiven.

This family is still super important to me but this felt more like closure and Im at peace with my feelings now. Its a chapter in my life that was bittersweet with a lot of great memories but is now closed. Ill always look back fondly, but now its time for me to move on.

The last Ive heard, My exs ex-child(???) is living with her mother and her biological father is now more involved in her life. My ex stopped visiting all together and doesnt seem to be in great shape but I havent inquired because I dont feel like its my place anymore. I wish him well and hopefully hes able to move on from this.

For those who messaged me saying that this is fake, believe what you want to believe. I dont really care anymore that you think this is from a youtube video. I just hope that those who are reading this know that even though you are struggling, are in tough times, or are just depressed with your life, know that it WILL get better. It happened to me and it happened to a lot of people. You too are special and you too will achieve happiness. Dont give up on yourself. Do what is right. If you think this is fake, believe it so as long as you get this message loud and clear.

Mucho love to those who supported me, love ya =

I looked up from my desk to the man with hands tucked into his skinny jeans as he glared at me over Gucci sunglasses.

You hung the Privacy Please sign on your door, ordered iced tea, and told the girl that her art sucked more than a hungry litter of newborn kittens. That was an exact quote. I frowned.

The man scowled. I expect better treatment at your price point. I can afford the Hilton, but I came here for the ambiance, and that girl ruined it.

I moved aside a glass of water, pushed away the paperwork, stood, and folded my arms. Over the years, Ive come to recognize when certain guests are going to spend half the day demanding all of my attention. The girl is also a guest. I have no control over her behavior.

Skinny Jeans folded his arms and leaned forward. Maybe youre not trying hard enough.

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. Shes six years old. You made her cry.

You cant coddle children. It turns them into snowflakes. He looked around the living room that also served as my office. I should have gone with the Hilton. Everyone raves about that stupid garden you use to feed the guests, but your breakfast was blasé at best. This is just a shitty house, and its much smaller than my own, which is very large.

The chill ran through my neck again, like something was breathing just behind me. The curtains tickled my cheek despite the absence of any breeze. Sir, youre at a bed and breakfast. The whole point is that youre staying in my house.

He grunted and stared at my painting of the Pequod above the mantel. I shouldnt have listened to the online reviews. This house would be much nicer if you got rid of the shitty art and furniture.

The chill ran past my neck, into my back, through my chest, and out of my stomach, leaving me lukewarm inside. Sir, please dont insult the house. Its one of the oldest continuously inhabited residences in Massachusetts, and-

-and no one cared about it enough to make improvements since 1850. He chuckled. Its not your fault, some people are born without taste.

The glass of water tipped over, spilling across the days paperwork. My stomach dropped. Sir, Im a very open-minded person, but the one policy upon which I must insist is that you do not insult the Watcher-

Who came up with such a stupid name for a house? he snapped.

His sunglasses fell to the floor and cracked in two.

What the *fuck*? Those were worth $3,000, you bitch!

I didnt touch them, I answered in a tone of forced control. As I explained upon arrival, the only rule we have is that you not insult the house-

How do you expect me not to insult something that sucks? he spat as he slammed his boots against the broken glasses. Im the smartest person in the room, and you know it. I have clients who practically run the State of Connecticut, and theyll have this place shut down.

Sir, this isnt Connecticut-

Im going to pack my things. I wont be staying another night.

The lukewarm streak in my stomach turned fiery as the room got warmer. Sir, I whispered, please just leave this house immediately and I will refund your visit.

He looked down at me with a victorious smile. Its too late to apologize. He shook his head, never breaking eye contact with me. You have a pleasing frame, and probably could change my mind if you were forty years younger. But you just have to accept the fact that youre not as hot as you once were. Skinny Jeans turned around, crossed the room, and climbed the stairs to the second floor.

The heat left my stomach as papers on my desk fluttered, and the door slammed behind him without being touched. Nausea gripped my gut as I collapsed into my chair, panting. I rested my forehead in my open palms, my entire body shaking.

Fuck.

*

Nineteen minutes later, Id climbed the thirteen steps to the second floor. My hands trembled as I walked down the narrow hallway, eyeing the final door on my left. Was it safe to check?

Of course not. But it never would be.

I struggled to twist the knob as my sweaty palms slipped across metal. It took three attempts to open the door. I prayed that it wouldnt be a terrible sight.

It was a terrible sight. A coppery smell hit me before anything else, and I couldnt force myself not to stare at the carnage.

How did so much blood get on the ceiling? I whispered. 

The bed sheets fluttered, followed by curtains near where I stood. Then my stomach went from hot to lukewarm to cold to hot again as my arms turned frigid. I gasped and stepped back, suddenly very afraid. 

Im not complaining, I announced to the room. I  Ill clean it up. 

Taking a tentative step over a rogue eyeball, I lifted what had once been Skinny Jeans arm. It felt uncannily like an oversized turkey leg from the Renaissance Fair. 

You know me, I explained to the ostensibly empty room, I always look on the bright side. Hell be enough to fertilize the whole garden, and that keeps our guests coming back [year after year](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

Well guess what? Time for some karma you rainbow bellied bitch.

I'll never judge a someone for hedging their portfolio, but actively hoping for death, destruction and widespread bankruptcy is another thing entirely.

It's not very nice to want to see the world burn, so that you can make some money.

The next few weeks will tell that just like every other time we thought the end was here - the world is not actually going to cave in on itself.

I will bet you all my money (and I have) that the bottom was Monday.

Reasons why Monday was peak fear:

* The world is beginning to relax a bit as we understand that USA and Russia are not going to nuke each other
* Europe will not lose access to it's energy
* Fertilizers will not be sanctioned, and the crisis will not trigger a global famine
* Despite what the headlines say, Russia was not cut off entirely from SWIFT. Only some banks were.
* Both sides want some form of peace
* Just by looking at the inflationary data from 2021, you can see that we are about to hit an inflection point in inflation growth. The rise in inflation will start slowing until the actual YOY growth rate of inflation starts falling below 8%, then 7%, then 5% etc. Price levels will not fall, but the growth rate will.
* Oil is falling, and is taking pressure off inflation.
* The markets WANT interest rate hikes now. That means the rate hike today is GOOD NEWS.
* On Monday, SPY tested the 200 day and 50 day MA death cross. We bounced.
* Jerome Powell is about to whisper sweet soothing nothings into our ears, like he always does.

So in closing, if you were literally cheering for a global catastrophe in the form of WW3 and hyperinflation so that your stocks would go up:

# You. Are. A. Terrible. Person.

If that's you cheering for pain, fuck you and you deserve your losses.

A pharmacist in MO refused to fill my medication.","This week has been the hardest week of my life and I am not one to want to share these things, but I believe too many people are ignorant about what going through a miscarriage is actually like (including myself before this week).

My husband and I have been trying for a baby for almost a year. I had made so many life style changes, started reading baby books, was taking my prenatal vitamins, and already seeing a physician about possible fertility issue just in case. Finally, on June 4th, I had a positive pregnancy test. My husband and I both cried, it was probably the best day of our lives.

We were overzealous and though we knew miscarriage was an option, you can't convince yourself it will happen to you. We started preparing immediately, buying baby stuff, making lists, and I had a dr's appointment and my first ultrasound scheduled within days.

On Wednesday, my baby was supposed to be 9 weeks and 3 days. We went to the ultrasound and there my baby was. It was there and everything I wanted. Even though I could see it, and it seemed so perfect, I felt in my gut something was wrong because the ultrasound tech was quiet. The silence was deafening and I was convincing myself she was quiet because she wasn't the Dr and wasn't allowed to talk about it. After what felt like 10-15 minutes of pictures, she pulled the ultrasound back to my baby and zoomed back in. She started talking finally. ""And there's your baby, there's the yolk, and the sac... I am so sorry but there is no heartbeat.""

She just sat there, with my baby on the screen, the probe still in my vagina, as I cried and all my husband could do is grab my leg. Eventually she pulled it out and told me she would be back with a Dr. We sat in there for twenty minutes, crying. I spiraled through all the emotions possible grief, anger, fear, guilt, and denial. I almost convinced myself that once the Dr saw the pictures he would know the baby was fine, and the technician was wrong.

The Dr came in and confirmed the baby was not viable. They are able to tell in two ways, one by some measurement (I cannot remember what it was) and by not having a heartbeat. My baby was not viable for both reasons.

The Dr talked with us for a long time and was very kind, but it was so confusing and hard. Miscarriage is confusing and not enough people talk about it. He told me I had a few options: 1) wait to see if my body miscarries by itself. I was not showing signs of miscarriage, and my baby was still there. He said this could take weeks and if the process begins it can take weeks. He said if I do this, I need to monitor for heavy bleeding, extreme pain/cramping, fevers, shortness of breath, and chills. I asked, well isn't miscarrying going to produce heavy bleeding and extreme cramping? His answer was yes. Then how do I know if I need to go to the emergency room? He said well go if you think you need to. If my body did not miscarry itself, I could get sick from sepsis and would put myself at risk and possibly need more emergent care. 2) Take a medical intervention (misoprostol). This will cause the miscarriage and most of it will be done between 24 and 48 hours. 3) Do a D&amp;C, a surgical procedure to remove all the tissue.

The Dr. scheduled me an appointment for the very next day to figure out what we wanted to do. The next day I was with a new Dr to me, but a Dr they specifically chosen because she had dealt with this with patients before and she told me she has went through it herself. Wednesday night, I had extremely cramping and heavy bleeding. I believed this was likely my miscarriage, and it had happened naturally. I told the Dr what had happened, and again realized I knew nothing about miscarriages. She said it could have been. It could have been some of it, could have been none of it. She said I still had the option to wait it out naturally, but again this could lead to it's own risks. We talked through all the options again, and my husband and I agreed the misoprostol was the best option. This way we would know it was done and wouldn't have to live in fear waiting. And to be honest, I couldn't live with knowing my dead baby was inside me any longer.

These are abortion pills. These are what you take when you need an abortion. Let me tell you why I fucking know first hand why no one uses this shit was birth control. I was so scared to take these pills. ""Expect extreme cramping and bleeding, but also go to the emergency room if you have extreme cramping and bleeding."" It was all so confusing. ""Be warry of fevers, chills, shortness of breath, dizziness."" Expect extreme pain, but just rotate between over the counter Tylenol and ibuprofen. Know this could go on for up to 48 hours. Stay home.

And at the end she said ""When you go to the pharmacy, they are going to ask if you are pregnant. If you say yes, they will not give them to you. Tell them instead you are having an active miscarriage"".

Our hell wasn't over. Now we get to go to a Walgreens pharmacy and have to be asked an intrusive question and answer it in front of everyone. You ever been to a Walgreen's pharmacy???????? There is no fucking privacy.  I already had a pit in my gut, I am in Missouri, I was ready for the judgement.

I went to the Walgreen's pharmacy attached to the medical center I was at. I thought it would be safe and they would be the most understanding. And they were... but they did haven't the prescription. She told me she could order it for tomorrow (Friday). My husband had to leave for work on Saturday and I didn't want to be going through this alone, so I told her I needed it today. She told me to try another Walgreens.

We went to the next Walgreens. I asked the technician to check if they had it before they filled it, because I needed it today. She checked and said it was available and they would get it filled. I felt some relief and was ready to get this one nightmare over with and start the next. Then she came out, and she said she was so sorry but the pharmacist refused to fill it.

The pharmacist refused to fill it. It hadn't clicked in my head what was going on, I asked why, she said he said the ""dose was too high"". I gave them my medical paper work (I was not thinking, I just was panicked and wanted this over with). She gave it back to him and came back and just said he refused to fill it. That's it. I asked what I can do, what I need to do. She said she didn't know, there was nothing.

To be honest, I cursed and I cried. I am embarrassed but have I not fucking been through enough? have I not fucking suffered enough? My husband and I went back to the car and we called the original pharmacy, I was crying and yelling and they were so nice. They worked to figure out what they could do for me, and they ended up being able to fill it by giving me a shit ton of lower dosage pills. Thank you to those brilliant angels that went out of their way because they realized how much I needed just some fucking human decency.

I bled a lot on the pills. I cramped a lot and it hurt. I cried a lot and I miss my baby.

And then Friday I was told Roe vs Wade was gone. And I have heard so many people over and over again say this won't hurt women who are having miscarriages and how we are overreacting.

I can tell you right now, the day before it was even gone, that I was denied my medication I needed for my miscarriage. I was denied it in Missouri by a male pharmacist. Right now, it hurts too much, but I am going to call and get his name and file a formal complaint, but this will not end. This will get worse.

I am so scared to have a baby now. This process hurt so much and was so evil and such a fucking nightmare. And now it will be worse. I am so scared of how I will be treated if this happens again. We don't deserve this, no one deserves this.

I was always pro-choice because it's none of my damn business what other women do with their bodies. But I wanted to share my story, because so many people keeping fucking spouting how this won't affect women who have miscarriages.

FUCK YOU to every single one of those people.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: I want to say thank you for everyone's kindness. After this situation and then all the Roe vs Wade discussion right afterwards, I was feeling very negative, helpless, and alone. This has made me feel much stronger, more hopeful, and now angry.

My family filed complaints by calling this customer service number:  Company/Store Inquiries or *Complaints*: (toll-free) 1-800-*WALGREENS* (1-800-925-4733) . Please be warned, some of them were moved around a few times and on hold a few times. I am unsure of other avenues to complaints.

u/copper_rainbows shared the following privacy complaint form link: [https://www.walgreens.com/pharmacy/privacyComplaintForm/privacyComplaintForm.jsp?tier3Id=1462](https://www.walgreens.com/pharmacy/privacyComplaintForm/privacyComplaintForm.jsp?tier3Id=1462)

My details for the complaint and others to avoid this Walgreens

Address:  330 SW Ward Rd, Lee's Summit, MO 64081

Time: June 23, 2022 at \~4:10 PM

There was only one pharmacist on staff at this time from my knowledge. With these details, Walgreens will know who the person was and I will not have to share a name.

The entire situation:

\- Called them on our way to their location at 3:58 PM, the technician that answered kept getting our last name spelt wrong and would not answer if they could fill it today.

\- Arrive there around 6-8 minutes later, gave details to technician at the counter and asked if she could see if they could fill it today.

\- Technician checked and said yes it was available and went to process the medication.

\- We waited at the chairs in the lobby. The technician came out and said the pharmacist refused to fill the medication, the dosage was too high. I asked what we could do, she said he called our original Walgreens pharmacy (the one that did not have the specific dosage I needed on hand) and they did not answer (WE WILL GET BACK TO THIS). I asked if we could call our physician. She did not respond.

\- THE DOSAGE WAS FOR 600 MICROGRAMS OF MISOPROSTOL EVERY 6 HOURS FOR 24 HOURS. YOU CAN EASILY GOOGLE THIS IS ACTUALLY ON THE LOWER END OF DOSAGES FOR MISCARRIAGE.

\- Gave the technician my paperwork to give to the pharmacist (I should not have done this, but was panicked and did not know what to do)

\- She took it back to him, came back and just said he would not fill it.

\- Asked what I can do? Can I call my physician? What if I call the other pharmacy?

\- She did not respond or give any advice.

\- The pharmacist NEVER CAME TO SPEAK TO ME. Never.

\- I cried and cursed. Sorry to the technician, but no one would help me or give me any information.

\- Left and went to my car. Immediately called the original Walgreens pharmacy. They answered immediately and said they never received a call. I told them about the situation, she was silent and said they were not going to fill it, and started working with me to get it figured out there.","TwoXChromosomes",54432,54432,0,0.85,144,9,32,1753

Wade","The Supreme Court has officially released its ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, on the constitutionality of pre-viability abortion bans. The Court ruled 63 that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overturning both Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and returning ""the authority to regulate abortion"" to the states.

Justice Alito delivered the majority opinion, joined by Justices Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Justices Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice Roberts each filed concurring opinions, while Justices Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan dissented.

I am an OB/GYN in a busy suburb of San Francisco. One of my patients was the vice president of a large health insurance corporation. She was a dynamic executive who climbed the corporate ladder quickly. One of her special talents was reducing healthcare benefits for patients. She initiated a policy where women who underwent cesarean section would to be discharged in two days rather than the standard four day hospital stay. Shortly after having in vitro fertilization she found herself pregnant with twins. During one of her office visits I mentioned the new two-day policy. I told her that for some patients it was really rough to be discharged after major surgery in two days and be expected to care for a newborn infant. She just smiled and said that she didn't get where she was in corporate America by giving away money. And patients just needed to suck it up. Health insurance wasn't meant to be a convenience.

She was 42 years old and went to full-term with her twins. Despite her age she elected to attempt a vaginal delivery because of the quick recovery. Her labor was long and extremely difficult and ended with cesarean section. On day two I went to her room to complete her discharge from the hospital. She said, ""I'm NOT leaving! This is inhuman! You can't expect me to go home and take care of twins like this! I can barely walk! All you need to do is write a note in the chart that says I'm having a complication. My stay will be authorized."" I told her that would be fraud. And I wouldn't be willing to falsify a medical record.

I'm just going to be direct and quick. 

I (M35) have 2 sisters that I'm close with, I also have a niece (Leah), Leah's 16 and after my ex wife decided to split up and divorce due to inferitility problems that lasted for 5 years. I started a college fund for Leah to help her go to her chosen college. That was in 2019 

Now I visit my mother's home (where my sister and Leah are living) every week to spend the weekend together. 

This past weekend I was asleep upstairs while my mother, my sister and Leah were in the kitchen. I came downstairs to grab a glass of water and heard my sister talking about my ex wife expecting a baby with her new husband. This struck a nerve and I kind of froze from shock. I then heard Leah react to the news repeatedly saying ""I told you so I told you so"" then explained she's always thought that I was the one with a problem for not being able to have a baby with my ex, but that I was too ""afraid"" to admit due to fragile masculinity. I could not believe what she said but what made it worse is her following statement about how my ex was smart to get a divorce before it was too late. I went upstairs and into the room and shut the door and stayed there for hours. 

Mom and sister saw me about to leave and insisted to know what the problem was. I didn't want to argue but I told them that I heard what Leah said about me. Leah stopped eating and got quiet. My sister tried to play dumb but I told her I heard their entire conversation about my ex wife and her pregnancy news. My sister tried to backpaddle saying Leah is just a kid who doesn't know much about this stuff and was just ""spouting nonesense"". I told them I don't wanna talk about it and they refused to let me leave but I left eventually.


I later sent my sister a text telling her about how hurt and devastated I was because of what Leah said, and told her I will no longer be responsible for funding her education. My sister kept trying to call then texted saying Leah didn't mean what she said and offered to make her apologize but I didn't feel comfortable being in the same room with someone who, blamed me for something that was out of my control and, something that literally turned my life upside down. 

My mother tried to get me to come over so we could talk saying Leah doesn't deseve me turning my back on her like that.


ETA So this went off unexpectedly, I read a lot of insightful comments but couldn't keep up (I'm sorry). I haven't seen my sister nor Leah after what happened. but they are still trying to contact me, which means there's still a room for a discussion and so I've decided to go see them tomorrow, sit down together and have a long conversation but this. Now I admit I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable talking about what's bothering me. especially when it comes to sensitive topics, but like some of you have said, this is my family, my niece and her future. I admit that I was mad when I told my sister about the college fund cancelation, I love Leah so much and see her as my own daughter. Unfortunately her dad, my BIL is deceased and so I understand losing a parent at a young age and relate to the kind of hurt she carries inside ( lost my father in an accident when I was 11) And I think that...sitting down and talking things out is the best option before I make any decision. Hopefully this will get resolved soon and I'm so sorry for the long ETA but I just wanted to let you guys know. I might update on what happens after we talk so we'll see how it goes.


Thank you so much for bearing with me. Also, one more thing to clarify, both my ex wife and I were having these fertility issues, both sides but since my ex wife got pregnant soon after her new marriage then my family thought that I was the problem ""originally"". It is what it is and I'm learning to not words get in my head so easily. I'm not mad at anyone, I'm just trying to move on with my life like anybody else.","AmItheAsshole",24690,24690,0,0.95,39,0,8,5631

They've tried absolutely everything, from medical to spiritual, but unfortunately, nothing works. Now that she's approaching late 30s, they're starting to look into adoption, but it's also been a slow going, since their financial condition isn't exactly stable from multiple rounds of fertility treatments they went through. I can only imagine the struggle, and I sympathize with her, but the stress this situation is bringing her and her husband honestly puts a strain on our relationship.

My husband and I (both 30) lost our best friends, Mason and his wife, Kate, two weeks ago in a horrible car accident. They left behind their son Pete, who isn't even two yet. It was so sudden and so heart-wrenching. We're still grieving, which lowers out contact with a lot of people, including my sister and BIL. Our main concern right now is ourselves and Pete, whose custody has come to us because we're both his godparents, actively engaged in Pete's life since his birth, and because Mason and Kate have neither left a Will nor have immediate living relatives who can take him in.

We've decided to adopt Pete as soon as we can stomach the process. My husband and I never planned on having kids, and even if we did, this is absolutely not the way we want to go about it. The situation is far from ideal, but we're starting the adoption process yesterday, for Pete's safety if nothing else. We broke the news to our extended families and friends, letting them know that my husband and I won't be very available for a little longer because of this.

I know my sister and BIL will have something to say about this. I'm prepared for a few heated text messages or voice mails. However, I didn't expect them to turn up on our doorstep, crying about how ""unfair"" it is that we were given everything they wanted, and how we didn't deserve to be parents because we didn't go through what they had to. I've never seen my husband so angry before. He's usually very mild and gentle, but recent events have stretched our patience to the limits. We kicked them off of our porch, and I told my sister before she left that since our pain inconveniences her so much, I won't have her around me and my family at all anymore.

I know she made a fuss about it, and now everyone has something to say to us. We turned off our phones, so we don't know which ones are cursing us and which one aren't. I know some did/are. My husband and I are both in pain and grieving, and we can't trust ourselves to be objective. Did we go to far?

Edit: I originally did not want to put this information in, because I don't want everyone to point at it and say this is the reason we're not in the wrong. For the sake of disclosure: My husband and I are both men. No, this is not a case of homophobia. My sister, for all her fault, was the first person to accept me for who I love, and I will not hear a single word about this in the comment. ","AmItheAsshole",23809,23809,0,0.97,43,1,2,2025

Pleased read the full story.

My husband's brother (BIL 37) and his wife (SIL 35) struggled with infertility for years after trying so much for long they decided to stop. But started...sort of living the experience of having a child by doing the things that parents do like getting a nursery (they removed it now) buying bany cothes, toys, attending school shows etc etc.


I'm 7 months pregnant, and BIL &amp; SIL has been asking many questions on what's it like to be expecting. It was bothersome with them getting involved but I grin &amp; bear til they requested to be with me in the delivery room to experience child birth. I said no and stood firm but later discovered that my husband ""volunteered"" his place to give his brother and his wife both a chance to have this experience. We had a fight and I told him off.

BIL &amp; SIL came over later to try to ""talk me"" into it, I nicely said no but they pushed me so I blew up telling them their fertility problems aren't my fault (harsh I know and regret saying it) and told them to get therapy. Sil started crying, Bil asked me take time to think but I rudely said there was nothing to think about and my mind's already been made. 


They left and my husband starte raging, after yelling at me about how this is his child too and how rude and dismissive I was to his grieving and strugglig brother and wife, he told me to look him in the eyes and tell him if I would be happy to ruin his brother's marriage when I can do this small, yet graceful deed and help BIL and wife ""process"" their trauma and finally make peace with it. I felt so much anger I cried, he told me to get over myself already and stop being purposefully selfish and petty.

We're not talking now and he says it stays this way til I say yes, I might've acted cruel but I just wanted him as the father of my child to be with me and don't feel comfortable with BIL &amp; SIL being there.","AmItheAsshole",23393,23393,0,0.96,41,0,5,5086

She has a daughter (8) from a previous relationship. Right off the bat, it was made known I had fertility issues and likely wouldnt ever be able to father a child. I moved slow in the relationship, although I had fallen in love with her fast. When things got serious, I overheard her telling her sister she was concerned that I might be an aggressive type person because of the amount of scars I have. I didnt want her scared away so I told her I had a bad childhood and left it at that. 

A little over two years into our relationship, I felt somewhat comfortable opening up and for the first time I told her exactly why Im infertile which is a direct result of an injury I suffered due to trauma as a child. She was really empathetic and I was just thankful I had found the one I want to spend my life with that also came with a kid I adore. 

Fast forward to last summer. My partner and her friend decided to play an impromptu prank on me. I came home from work, there were multiple positive pregnancy tests in the bathroom. My partner announced she was pregnant, I started freaking out&a happy freak out cause I thought I had hit the lottery with the slim to none chance I have. They both started laughing, the tests were from the friend and not my partner. 

I was pretty much devastated and felt really let down that my partner would actually pull a prank like that. At first she was shocked by my reaction and said, I thought youd know it was a joke considering your circumstances. She ended up apologizing after realizing how hurt I was. 

Now for the point of the post. Three weeks ago she arranged a huge dinner with her entire family at our house. She had us play this stupid mystery game and ultimately announced to everyone shes pregnant. Her mother and sisters were deliriously happy. Immediately I got pissed thinking this was yet another prank, so I showed absolutely no emotions which everyone caught on to. I said to my partner, Either youre just mentally disturbed or youre cheating. Thats pretty much when all hell broke loose. 

My partners POV is that she was sincerely apologetic about the prank and I should know her well enough to not think shed ever pull that stunt again. Shes also livid at me for ruining the announcement, embarrassing her in front of her entire family, causing them to think Im a horrible person and then finally insinuating that shes a cheater. 

I still stand by my claim that had she never pranked me, my reaction would have been different. I do find it odd she decided to tell me along with her family. Things would have likely went over better had she told me first, and then we announced it together. But Im starting to think I acted immaturely causing scene in front of her family, and I think thats maybe where Im wrong.","AmItheAsshole",23311,23311,0,0.97,15,0,6,2554

To start off I want to say that my husband (36M) has an old friend (33M) that he's known since highschool. they're inseperable and spend the entire week together. like they're really really close.

My husband and I struggled with fertility issues for years. we recently started new method (IVF) in hopes to get at least one child together. Note that I saved for the majority of treatment while my husband only paid 2-3 thousands. We saved up for another round after the huge disappointment and heartbreak from failing the first time (that's just how it goes). This time I'd put all the money (including dad's inhertance) and my husband didn't pay a cent.


Last week I found out that he secretly pulled out 7k (we had 11k in total). I was completely and utterly shocked I confronted him and he casually reminded me of how many times his best friend complained about his ""old junk"" car and he decided to ""lend"" him 7k to buy a decent car, his argument was that his friend would've done the same for him. I was beyond livid I asked if he really thought that was okay and he said that I shouldn't worry and guaranteed his friend will pay us back in time. I lost it on him and immediately demanded his friend to send the money back and threatened police involvement in case he refused. His friend immediately returned the money but told my husband about the polic thing and my husband came home and yelled at me calling me unhinged and selfish. I told him I saved up some of this money/used my inheritance for this treatment while he contributed nothing even though we're in this together. He ""corrected"" me saying I'm the one with the problem and he thought it's only fair that I ""make up"" for it by paying for the IVF myself. This hurt so badly and I couldn't argue anymore. He went to stay with his friend while constantly shaming me for how I treated them both and for the police invovlement like they stole from me or something.","AmItheAsshole",23100,23100,0,0.96,28,0,3,4174

[**AITA for ruining a pregnancy announcement by telling the woman she may have taken the wrong test**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/oanl22/aita_for_ruining_a_pregnancy_announcement_by/) - 30 June 2021

Obligatory sorry for the formatting. I'm on mobile and it's my first post on here. 

My husband and I (30m, 30f) recently invited eight friends for lunch and were asked if we could also include a new couple, Doug and Sasha (both 30s). We have never met them, but everyone who was invited has, so we said sure. 

At one point Sasha needed to use the restroom, and I told her to use the master since the other bathroom was occupied. I was helping my husband finish with food when Sasha came out of the master bawling and holding something in her hand. At first I thought she hurt herself, but she said something to Doug that caused him to drop to his knees, cry, and begin kissing her stomach. All of our friends begin screaming, jumping, and crying. It was insane. 

Finally, Sasha tells my husband and I that she is pregnant. Of course, we congratulate both she and Doug and gave them a bag for the test (their request). I will admit I did find it odd that she brought a pregnancy test and took it at a complete stranger's house, but I did not say that. 

Once everyone sat down to eat Sasha said: OP, I hope you don't mind that I used one of your pregnancy tests. I just saw them and had to. I responded (confused) I don't have pregnancy tests. Sasha says yes, in your drawer. I asked Sasha if she meant the blue box in the back of my lower left drawer that was closed. 

She seemed to realize I was pointing out that she basically snooped and sheepishly said the box said pregnancy for pregnancy test. I said Sasha, the brand is Pregmate and those are ovulation tests. I do not own pregnancy tests. Did you take an ovulation test? 

Doug freaked the absolute F out at me saying his wife was not an idiot and can read a box. He insisted Sasha get the test out and show me that I'm wrong. Sasha refused saying she didn't need to prove anything to a complete stranger and insisted they leave immediately. 

One of the couples thought Doug and Sasha acted ridiculous. The other three couples thought I should have pulled Sasha aside to discuss my concerns and said I was an asshole for saying something in front everyone. 

Honestly, the whole situation caught me off guard and everything happened so quickly. The whole thing was bizarre and confusing. I just didn't have time to put the pieces together mentally before asking about the ovulation tests. 

Also, I found out later through one of our friends that Sasha did take an ovulation test, and she is not pregnant.

Verdict: NTA

**EDIT TO ADD UPDATE:**

I do not meet the criteria for a standalone update. I'm not sure if anyone will see this. In case anyone does ... 

First, let me thank anyone who took time to read, comment, or give an award. I am very, very, very grateful for the feedback. 

Based on the responses, today I called up one of my friends who was present (and took Doug and Sasha's side) and basically told her I was owed and explanation for wtf happened. Here is what I found out: 

- Apparently my friends have know D&amp;S for much longer than I realized. This is strange because they have never talked about D&amp;S before this.

- Doug constantly brings up wanting to have a baby every time they see him. 

- One night Sasha confided in the women that Doug divorced his first wife because she was ""old and infertile"" - she was the same age as Doug. Doug married Sasha because she was ""young and fertilize"" - Sasha heard him tell this to some friends. At that point D&amp;S had been trying to conceive for over a year, and Sasha was concerned that Doug was going to leave her. They (the women in my friend group) tried to convince Sasha that this is not a healthy relationship, but she insisted she was happy and just needed to get pregnant. They ""gave her the courage to seek medical assistance"" which she had previously been too scared to do. 

- Sasha end up getting prescribed fertility meds at her appointment and was scared to test with Doug, so they told her they would come to her house to be with her when she tested and be a support system for her. 

- The day D&amp;S were at my house was after Sasha's first round of meds and she was in the window to test. She had not planned on testing but had a ""lightbulb moment"" when I told her to use my bathroom. 

- Sasha only took the test and did not steal anything. When the test came back with two lines, Sasha was in shock and immediately wanted to share with her husband and support system. 

- Doug was mortified by the ordeal and D&amp;S have been fighting a lot.

- Sasha has been badmouthing me to anyone who will listen. She believes I ruined her marriage and embarrassed her and Doug because my husband and I were threatened by D&amp;S and the friendships they were building. Sasha told my girl friends they shouldn't spend time with me anymore because who can be friends with someone who treats a guest in their own home that way. 

- My friends felt they had to take Sasha's side in the moment because they knew how important the pregnancy was to her marriage. 

- I am back on good terms with my friends. 

Also, yes my husband and I have been privately trying to get pregnant. I am pissed that now my friends are aware. Thank you to my fellow TTCers, past and present, who mentioned this invasion of privacy or gave well wishes. You all touched my heart.

My egg was used so no worries in this regard, plus our surrogate is a respectful, kind woman who's been keeping her part of the contract in tact, but it's Hunter who's starting to act strange, I've noticed that he's been focusing his all attention on our surrogate like skipping work to visit her or get her things she didn't ask for, chat with her all the time on social media and also constantly offering to do things for her like .... drive her places and sometimes even invite her out or offer to repair stuff for her. She complained to me about this and even told me about things he's been doing that I didn't even know about, like bringing her gifts. I tried speaking to him about what this looks like but he said that he's doing what he's doing for his son and not her, still I asked that he tone it down and respect the woman's space. He got mad at me and accused me of being jealous of the woman who's carrying my own child and said that this makes me look bad. I said our surrogate was the one who complained about his behavior and he said that this wasn't true. Apparently this made him somewhat angry so I gave him time to cool down a bit.

Yesterday, our surrogate called me saying that Hunter came over and told her guests to leave, I asked why and she said that he wanted to show her the 9k car he bought for her. I was shocked, she said she declined the car and asked him to leave but he started arguing with her about using public transportation and risking our baby's wellbeing. I was fuming I called him demanding he get home and he did eventually. Once he got back I picked up a fight with him and yelled at him saying that he's been nothing but overstepping, disrespectful, and inappropriate towards our surrogate, again he explained the car wasn't for her but to ensure that the baby is safe. I told him to stop disrespecting the woman and stop using the baby as an excuse to stomp all over her boundaries. He ranted about how he was just trying to make this work and that I should do the same if not more, he even accused me of not loving our son as much he does but this isn't the way and putting 9k for car without telling me? He left the house for a while then came back and refused to speak to me.

I might've been hard on him, he might've just been oblivious so I'm less sure seeing his reaction now.","AmItheAsshole",20299,20299,0,0.96,13,0,3,1907

Both the older two have neurodivergencies. My youngest is 6 months old. I have fertility issues so it took me about 4-5 years between kids to get pregnant. As soon as we found out we were having our 3rd, my husband made an appointment for a vasectomy because we knew we were done. Her due date was in November but With Covid, it took almost 10 months to get an appointment. The surgery itself wasnt available until May. 
After her birth, the nurses left us with bye! See you again next time! 
NOPE! No& just no. We laughed and said no way. We were making steps to prevent that. Thats what they all say. 
We get home and my neighbor goes aww shes so sweet. Ready for the 4th? ABSOLUTELY THE F NOT! He goes the 4th is always the one that sneaks up on you. 
Not going to happen. With my fertility, I was lucky to have kids at all. 
May comes along. We did it. His vasectomy was the next day. We were sitting in bed watching a movie and I said thank god! We made it! No more babies! And proceeded to high five each other. 
The next morning, for giggles, I took a test because I had extra (TTC for over a year so I had a huge bag) 
We were laughing and joking and forgot about it. Went in an hour later to 2 lines. Yeah.. a positive. That couldnt be& maybe the tests were old? Maybe an evap line? We joked about it some more, but just in case I took another. Positive. Again. Ran to the store to buy a fresh one. Also positive. Guys&we wore condoms, we avoided possible ovulation windows, we did everything in our power besides abstinence to prevent a baby. Im convinced I got pregnant through that high five. Literally the only explanation. 
TL;DR 
I prematurely high-fived my husband before his vasectomy to find out Im pregnant again.","tifu",19918,19918,0,0.89,14,1,0,1133

She was my parent's favorite daughter. I have always been a little overweight, I had PCOS, my sister was slim and fit. I always held that resentment towards her, especially when she belittled me with my mom. Not letting me eat more than one serving of dinner or more than one serving of dessert. Telling me that sleeping in was making me gain weight. She always overshadowed my accomplishments. 

My sister married when she was 23 to a wealthy man (28) from our community. We're Indian, her marriage was arranged. They have 3 beautiful kids. I love my niece and nephews more than anything

 I married my husband (26) two years ago and we have been trying for a baby for almost one year. My sister always said that it was because I brought shame to my parents for marrying outside our culture that I couldn't have a baby.  After many negative pregnancy tests, a few months ago, we finally had a positive pregnancy test. Unfortunately, when I was four months, I had a miscarriage. I was devastated. I couldn't believe what was going on. Two months after our tragedy, my family threw my sister a birthday party. There she and her husband announced they were pregnant. My heart did ache, but I was happy for them

As the evening went on, my sister kept making comments like, ""we weren't even trying for a baby"", ""It so funny how we get pregnant so easily"". Just as I thought things couldn't get worse. We were standing with cousins when my sister said ""We didn't even want more kids, I was almost contemplating having an abortion"" She said all that while looking at me. 

I am all for women having abortions, but having my sister use it as a weapon against me. Showing off how fertile she is, how she was contemplating having an abortion after they decided to keep the baby and announce it. That really hurt me. I was so upset and frustrated. My husband noticed the change in my emotions immediately. We said goodbye to my parents and let the party immediately.

 I got many texts from my sister and our cousins calling me jealous and an asshole for walking out on my sister's birthday party, and not being part of their pregnancy celebration. My husband and our friends say that I had all the rights to feel the way I did, but I'm not sure.

So, am I the asshole?","AmItheAsshole",18867,18867,0,0.95,37,0,2,1148

I f32 have recently inherited money from my mom. she was only parent and losing her is beyond devastating. The money can barely be called inheritance because my mom and her family didn't have much but it's better than nothing. my fiance at first said I deserved it and have the right to do whatever I wanted with it.


However, he told his whole family about and then his infertile brother and his wife pulled him aside for a conversation. After that he started talking about ""wanting/needing"" a nephew/niece. basically hinting about his brother's infertility issues then flatout requested that I pay for his brother and wife's IVF treatment from my inheritence money. I was taken aback initially but then I declined. He got mad saying I was selfish because (1) He &amp; I are blessed to never have issues with fertility. and (2) I literally have nothing to lose if I give them money....""easy money"" that I didn't work for. This upset me to the point where I lashed oit at him telling him to stop bothering and guilting me about it.

I denied the request as a final decision. but he got more agitated and went on a campaign to shame me for treating him as if he's not my future husband therefor gets say/right to my inheritance. and not giving a single crap about his family's issues.","AmItheAsshole",17730,17730,0,0.96,15,0,2,2558

Fetuses do not matter. The only things in this world that are remotely worth caring about the lives of are sentient beings. We don't care about rocks, flowers, fungi, cancer cultures, sperm, egg cells, or anything of the sort. But we care about cats, dogs, birds, fish, cows, pigs, and people. Why? Because animals have brains, they see the world and feel emotion and think about things and have goals and dreams and desires. They LIVE. Flowers and fungi are alive, but they don't LIVE.

Fetuses don't live. They're human, they're alive, but they don't live until their brains start working enough to create consciousness. Until that happens there is no reason to give a fuck whether they're aborted or not, unless you're an aspiring parent who wants to have your child specifically. Nothing is lost if you go through your life abstinent and all your sperm or eggs never get fertilized and conceive the person that they could conceive if you bred. Nothing is lost if you use contraceptives to prevent conception. And nothing is lost if you abort a fetus. In every case, a living person just doesn't happen. Whether it happens at the foot of the conveyor belt or midway through the conveyor belt, it's totally irrelevant because a living person only appears at the end of the conveyor belt.

Anybody who thinks life begins at conception is misguided. Anybody who cares about the unborn is ridiculous. And anybody who wanted women to have their rights to their bodily autonomy stripped away for the sake of unliving cell clusters is abominable.

[AITA for making a scene when I found out my sister put my niece up for adoption when she had her son](https://rareddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mfq936/aita_for_making_a_scene_when_i_found_out_my/)

My sister had a second child and we were all thrilled for her. She lives a few states over and we haven't seen her this last year. She had one child 2 years ago with her bf and the other one was born last month.

Yesterday we had a family zoom meeting to see the baby and to say hi to my other nibbling. We get on, family starts to load in. Everyone is basically there thrilled to see the baby. We get to meet her new baby boy. After a bit I asked to see my niece as well.

My sister got quite and very quietly said she doesn't have her. My aunt questioned this and I was also confused. After a few minutes my sister said that in the beginning of January she put her daughter up for a closed adoption because she couldn't care for two kids.

Everyone lost it. The whole zoom was a mess. We didn't know. We never got to say goodbye. She didn't have to do this because any one of us would have taken my niece. Fuck, I could have taken her.. Ive had multiple miscarriages/fertility issues and although I am currently pregnant I am stable, owning a home, and have the resources to have taken a toddler as well as have my baby. Important: My sister has always also said she wanted to be a boy mom.

I lost it. I called my sister a narcissistic cunt. I asked her when she'd get bored of the new baby and get rid of that one too. I asked her how the hell she could do this without reaching out to family. I know my sister and I know deep down she just didn't want a daughter. She was depressed when she found out she was having a girl but thrilled for this entire recent pregnancy. I called her a monster for making children she didn't want to care for, like they were a novelty. I said some other things too.

At this point, my grandmother is a complete mess and says her chest hurts so I stop. My aunt who is with my grandmother goes to help her and turns off the camera. My grandmother ended up having a panic attack that they thought was a heart attack at first. I am so glad she is okay.

My sister has since cut off all contact from the entire family. My father is pissed at me for blowing up (I was the only one who did) and says that I pushed her away. He said he could have tried to convince her to reverse it but my verbal lashing completely ruined any chance of getting my niece back. I don't think he understands what a close adoption means. Also, adoption takes a minute so for her to have it completed by January makes me feel this process was in place for a minute. I don't think there's any chance of seeing my niece again when the mother and father both signed her to be adopted. He's mad at me because now he lost his grand daughter and is afraid he'll never know his grandson.

My dad things I'm an ass for freaking out and ""nearly giving my grandmother a heart attack."" I'm feeling guilty that my grandmother had such an extreme reaction but I feel that's more because she lost her great grand daughter

**Edit to update:**
I've contacted local CPS for my sisters area, local courts, and I have a lawyer looking into it for me (starting tomorrow as I just obtained him).

Thank you for the helpful comments pointing out the issues with this. Especially thank you to those in social work who reached out to me privately. I didnt realize how many options I had to fight this or to see if it was legit. I'll update when I find more out from the lawyer.

Lots of people commenting this is fake; I really wish it was. This has been a nightmare. Thank you again to those with helpful suggestions and feedback.

**Final Update:**I am pursuing legal custody and due to this I will not be providing any more updates. My lawyer recommended this. The kids come first. I can say a few things.

1. They found her. The adoption process started a year ago in silence as a ""private rehoming."" It was explained to me that we could fight it as they skipped steps in the process.
2. My sister told them she had no family/ the family she does have is abusive. There was abuse on our mothers side but they are long dead now.
3. Theres an open investigation into my sister already for her son because of the way she surrendered custody of her daughter.
4. I'm going to temporarily move into an apartment in that area so I am close by incase CPS takes custody of my nephew. It was explained that this was the only way I could actively fight for custody -- by being available and close.

Thanks to u/LetsBAnonymous93, it turns out there may be some kind of an update to this mess. She made the following post: 

[FTM- my MIL just informed us she has a full blown nursery for our baby and I'm unsure how to react to it.](https://rareddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/moaym2/ftm_my_mil_just_informed_us_she_has_a_full_blown/): 

Im unsure how to react to this new information.

I am 6 months pregnant with my first after multiple losses. My MIL just informed my husband that she wouldn't be getting anything for us for the baby shower because she's setting up her own nursery. She's using his old crib, which my husband originally thought we would get. (I'm fine with not getting his old crib, I'd rather buy a new one.)

***We may be getting custody of my sisters children as well*** and MIL made it clear they wouldn't be welcome but she had room for my future child. She sent pictures and her nursery is almost completed while we didn't start ours. Honestly, it's gorgeous. We just bought a house and we are saving for the possibility of taking my sisters children. We aren't going all out on a nursery, we are being frugal and mindful with it. Meanwhile she clearly spent thousands of dollars already.

It's just so odd that she's doing a full blown nursery. I'm a bit confused to why she's doing this. She doesn't talk to me much so she doesn't know I plan on exclusively breast feeding for a bit and attachment bonding. Frankly, I don't think my child would be spending the nights till after 6 months.

I'm unsure how to react to this.

**OOP also stated in the comments:**

&gt;Assuming your sisters' kids might be in your custody, they'd be raised as, or nearly as, siblings correct? Imagine how ""grandma"" wants the one but the other ones can't come over! That plus you are going to be attaching to your own LO via breastfeeding and all that. She can't breastfeed for you nor are there plans to enable her. (If you do choose to put your LO on formula, that's not necessarily bad, I just wouldn't tell her). Blended families are always complicated and her cutting out these other kids shows she's not up to blended family. Which is the way that yours is.

&gt;&gt;***Yes, chances are we will be getting full time custody***. I'm not okay with how she's been treating the expansion of our family. She's a first time grandmother as well and she's already rejecting the other two kids we will have. I don't want them growing up thinking they are less then the youngest child simply because of who birthed who. I want them to feel equally loved and respected. I'm going to bring that up to my husband as a major concern.","BestofRedditorUpdates",13694,13694,0,0.96,0,0,2,1032

I just wanted to share my e-mail here that I sent withdrawing my acceptance of the position.","Prior to Dobbs, I accepted a position that is my dream job.  The job was in Tennessee.  The Dobbs decision was issued after I had accepted the position and before I had received final approval.  After much consideration, I had to make the heart-wrenching decision to withdraw my acceptance.  This is the e-mail I sent, redacted in part to protect my privacy:

It is with a heavy heart that I am informing you that I must withdraw my acceptance for *(position redacted)*.  As you know, the political landscape has changed drastically in the last week.  Due to the current state of political affairs in Tennessee, I cannot live there.

I am devastated by the necessity of this decision.  I have wanted to be a *(position redacted)* for 15 years and I was thrilled to be selected.  However, it is unacceptable that I must be prepared to give up rights in order to be a *(position redacted)* in Tennessee.

Tennessees lawmakers have decided that womens reproductive health is a public concern.  As much as I would like to spare you the details of how this affects me personally, I believe this is important information to share under the circumstances since my reproductive health would be considered a matter of public concern if I moved to Tennessee.  More and more women will be placed in the humiliating position of having their reproductive health scrutinized.  I would not be exempt from this in Tennessee either.

I am a woman of child-bearing age.  I have an IUD.  There is a substantial risk of ectopic pregnancy, a medical emergency that will not result in viable embryo, in the event of IUD failure.  I do not trust that I could receive prompt and appropriate medical care if I experience this particular medical emergency in Tennessee.  Furthermore, IUDs need to be replaced every few years.  States with laws like those in Tennessee are contemplating banning IUDs as abortifacients due to the remote possibility that an IUD could potentially prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg (despite the fact that this is not the primary, or even the secondary, manner in which IUDs function).  These contemplated bans are without regard for the fact that an IUD, in cases such as mine, serves as medical treatment to prevent problems, such as extensive bleeding, that I would otherwise have with my menstrual cycle.

In short, my ability to obtain appropriate medical care is likely to be severely restricted or even eliminated if I were to move to Tennessee.  It is unthinkable that I would need to travel out-of-state to obtain routine or even emergent medical care on the basis of sex.  It is even more unthinkable that some states are taking the position that leaving the state for medical treatment could result in the commission of a crime.

I apologize for the inconvenience of withdrawing my acceptance at this stage.  I certainly could not have foreseen that womens rights would be stripped after 49 years at the time I accepted *(position redacted)*.

I am *(age redacted)* years old.  I grew up believing that I was equal to men.  I have conducted myself consistent with that understanding and I have refused to accept any discriminatory treatment for my entire life.  I am astounded that I have been put in the position of feeling like a second-class citizen for the first time in my life.

I am deeply disturbed by this entire situation and that I have no choice but to decline such an honorable appointment, that I have worked so hard to obtain, solely on the basis that I am a woman.","TwoXChromosomes",13487,13487,0,0.93,43,5,4,593

In my state, PLAN B sits on the shelves unlocked next to pads, tampons, and Monistat. Anyone can privately grab it and check out themselves. THAT IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

Edit: feeling petty. Reddit really is the only place that a """"""boarded OBGYN"""""""" can be openly transphobic and say creepy misogynistic comments about women who gain weight, and spread misinformation that flies against the official position of ACOG on the matter.

She has been planning her wedding for 2 years and I have been actively helping her the entire time as her maid of honor. I am extremely excited for her to get married, but she is slightly controlling. She's the kind of girl that has to have everything perfect or it's completely ruined. But her wedding, her rules.

Well, I found out I was pregnant at the beginning of October and am due toward the end of June. This is my first baby and I have struggled heavily with fertility issues so this is a literal miracle baby. My husband and I had literally just given up hope in trying for a little while this past summer. I will be in my second trimester during the time of her wedding. Well, I told my best friend last week and she seemed... upset. She wasn't too happy that I was pregnant and her first question is if I would fit in my bridesmaid dress. The dress is extremely flowy and I told her that I should be just fine, and if not I'll cover the cost of any alternations/buying another dress (I bought my dress in the first place anyways). Like literally her first question, not even congratulations.

I tried to shrug it off and just assumed she was stressed. Her bachelorette party is next month (I've been exclusively planning it) so I just reached out with the final details to her to confirm everything. During the phone call she tried to make me feel bad that I wouldn't be drinking with the rest of them and that it wouldn't be the ""bach party of her dreams"" and I told her it would still be fun. That upset me even more, but I just tried to shrug it off once again.

Today she called and told me she had a ""hard decision"" to make but she's been thinking about it and while she would like to keep me MOH she doesn't want me in her pictures. She said that my bump would be too distracting, she didn't want her pictures to turn into a ""maternity photoshoot"" and that she just didn't feel comfortable with it. However, she still wanted me to pay for the bachelorette party, help her plan the wedding, and wanted me to do almost everything MOH except be in pictures and she was debating if she still wanted me to give a speech. She then sent me a bunch of bag-like dresses to choose from as my new dress since I won't need my MOH dress.

We have been best friends since we were 10. I would have never in my wildest dreams expected her to act this way. WIBTA for dropping out of her wedding? I really don't feel like paying for, and being supportive of, a person who treats me like a disposable mooch after years of fertility issues. But I also feel like I may be overreacting as some of my friends said that I would look odd in the pictures. Thoughts?

Edit:

I want to first say a big thank you to all the wonderful comments of congratulations and support. I often try to be very level-headed about things, sometimes to the detriment of myself, and also still wanted to be a part of the day since she is my best friend and we have grown together for so long. I am someone who really values integrity and I felt like if I dropped out, I would be betraying a core value of mine. And many many many people reached out to me for an update, so here it is:

I sat down with her and had a very long and blunt talk. I even brought out the post to show her that I am not crazy about some of the points I made. I told her about how deeply my feelings were hurt by her words and actions. I told her I couldn't understand why I couldn't be a full MOH and be included in pictures. If I were to be fully honest, she almost convinced me that the whole idea of just keeping me as MOH but with no pictures was for my benefit. She told me it was to take the ""stress"" off of me for the day and to make sure I didn't feel uncomfortable with my ""new weight"" but I knew it wasn't true. I knew she just didn't want me to be in her wedding party with a baby bump but wanted my money and planning expertise (I've withheld this information but I am a wedding planner with many connections, however, I wouldn't cut any of them off due to a falling out. I am not planning her wedding as I felt it would be too much for me because I would want it to be to a level of perfection I couldn't achieve, but I did hook her up with another planner friend who is incredible but she has utilized me for free a lot). I think I realized all too clearly in almost an instant that the second she got engaged that our friendship became a business-partnership to her, whereas it never changed for me. For the past two years, what I thought were friendship-bonding experiences for me I realized were merely free expenses for her.

In the end, I decided to step out of the wedding as MOH. I will be sending all the information I have to our joint friend who is in the wedding party and will still be paying for that friend's portion of the bach party instead of the whole thing, as I know it will put that friend out of money which I feel awful about. I have been uninvited to the wedding as a whole, which was not unexpected. My friend was very angry and upset with the conversation and said some deeply hurtful things that will take me a long time to recover from. To say I am devastated is an understatement, as I expected this woman to be the godmother of my child. But I feel extremely relieved to have discovered this before the birth of my child. Now my baby's life will be filled with people who love them unconditionally. and the same goes for me.

His father is deceased, his fathers family dont want anything to do with him and my own family (minus my dad) have told me that they dont want anything to do with him either. 

Ive read and heard enough to know that I shouldnt expect anyone to help me and that my kid is my own responsibility so thats how Ive been dealing with everything. 

I work from home so I dont really need a babysitter for work or anything either.  

Im okay tbh. Im still dealing with grief and Im kind of lonely but every time I talk to anyone they always remind me that they dont want to deal with a baby. For example: I sent my sister a funny post and before reacting to the post she sent me a warning text saying that this doesnt mean shell babysit. I DIDNT EVEN MENTION MY SON???

Everyone does this to me, my mother, sisters, friends. They also act like I made a mistake for not terminating after my bf passed so yeah, Id rather be lonely. 

We have a family group chat and although I dont bother texting on there after my sisters told me not to send any pics of my son because nobody cares except me, I do read their conversations to feel something idek. 

Well idk how they didnt realize I was in the GC because you know-FAMILY GC-but they were talking about how they have a surprise party planned for my birthday and I lost it. I burst into tears and immediately called my sister who was with the rest of the family. 

I asked them what they were trying to accomplish after making me feel like shit for almost a year. She told me to stop being dramatic but I just kept going. I asked her and the rest of my family why they thought that Id appreciate the party after months of them not talking to me or my baby. My mom told me that she just wanted me to realize how difficult being a single mother is but I told her to shut up. I then told them all to leave me the fuck alone and dont bother with the surprise party. One sister called me a bitch and the others laughed at me saying that Im being hysterical and overly dramatic and they definitely werent doing the party now or at least until I apologize. 

I dont want to apologize though. I dont think Im the AH but my sisters and mother say that Im overreacting and that this is exactly why I dont have any friends. They say Im the AH. My dad found out about everything and came over last night and told me to ignore everyone but I cant stop thinking about this. AITA?

Edit:

My bfs family is very religious and dont like the fact that I had a baby out of wedlock. 

My 2 sisters are in their mid-late thirties and dont have children for whatever reason. They were supportive when my bf (no I didnt steal him from anyone) was alive but did make a few off comments about how fertile/young I am and how theyre not etc etc. I dont know why they switched up and thats also why I lost it.

My parents are divorced and my father is not in the gc. Its my sisters, mother and step father. Im sorry, shouldve made this clear.","AmItheAsshole",11790,11790,0,0.99,11,0,0,531

[**Original**](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/uuw0im/my_friends_are_mad_at_me_for_telling_my_friends/) **posted** r/TrueOffMyChest **on May 21st 2022.**

**My friends are mad at me for telling my friends wife about him demanding a paternity test from me, but seriously, Im gay.**

I dont know whether to laugh or cry over this entire situation thats unfolded in the past six weeks. I (23m) have a coworker Ive been friends with for four years, pretty much since I started working at the factory Im still in. Robert (32m) just had his first daughter Chelsea (2mo) after 4 boys. The boys are dang near carbon copies of him; bleach blond straight hair, freckless skin, and I swear to god they were just born with tans. His high school sweetheart/wife Danielle (32f) is a tight curled redhead with freckles for days, and burns like theres no tomorrow.

Their daughter from the jump had a full head of red hair thats already starting to curl. When I got to meet her, she was 2 weeks old.

I gasped (a fellow red head myself here with long curly red hair) and said something along the lines of, Omg it finally happened! The red is alive! Just being dramatic and funny.

Robert goes, Yeah dont bank on that staying. My genes are strong after all. Danielle rolled her eyes and I shrugged it off as a weird joke at first, but the entire time I was there, he pretty much kept going on about how his genes would prevail.

Jump forward, Chelsea is now five weeks old. For three weeks, every single day, Robert would be complaining about how little of himself he sees in his daughter, how much of a stranger she is for it, that somedays he thinks hes looking at another persons baby. He only ever seemed to want to complain to me about it as it was. After the fifth day in a row, I started trying to explain how genetics work, pretty much saying genes arent going to always drastically go one way.

Three days ago, Robert came into work just itching for an argument with everyone. Our mutual friend Jessie asked him wtf his deal was on our break after he shouted at another friend for asking a work related question. He blew up saying he knows Chelsea isnt his, that his cheating wh@re of a wife just wont admit it and he knows exactly who she was Fing around with. He then looks over at me and points at me and yells at me to get my A$$ outside. I asked why? And he starts screaming hes not stupid, he knows Ive been trying to kiss a$$ to avoid this beat down.

Im gay. I have a male fiancé. I have a pride stickers all over my car. Outside of work I am a parrot of colorfulness. I just couldnt help but laugh at him, it was just so bizarre and I know I wasnt the only one looking at him like he was insane either. I told him Chelsea is literally half of Danielles genetics, that Danielle isnt a Fing incubator for his genetics, and asked him why he was so obsessed with their kids needing to look exactly like him? Whats the point of that? He wouldnt answer and just kept telling me to get up before he dragged me out to the parking lot. I told him Im not going to fight him on something this ridiculous and asked him if he was trying to get fired?

He started demanding I take a paternity test and I again asked if he was completely serious.

He said he was because I spend so much time with Danielle. Hes not necessarily wrong, but shes a part of the girlfriend group Im apart of, theres five of us in total and We do artsy stuff, try new places, just hang out and do whatever but never stuff like THAT.

I told him to go take a paternity test for himself. He argued that hes not paying for a test he knows the truth to. I told him well Im not paying for a paternity test and then asked which redhead in the factory was he gonna accuse next? The exchange ended when our shift manager came in for her break.

I texted Danielle and told her exactly what happened. Next day was my day off, so my phone was on silent and I slept in. Woke up to Elliot (my partner) getting off the phone and telling me I should check my phone. Id been bombarded with dozens of messages and missed calls/threatening voicemails from Robert because Danielle had kicked him out. Hed decided to get Elliots number out of Danielles phone to tell him his version of events. Id already told Elliot the night before so he was just baffled how certain Robert was.

Danielle did text me a few times, apologizing on his behalf and then updating me they were getting a paternity test/shes filing for divorce, that she has no idea why hed think such a thing. My partner thinks its hilariously sad Robert destroyed his marriage like this.

This morning while getting ready for work, Robert texted me saying he has the money and when the test comes back with the truth hed F me up in court for what Ive done, how Ive ruined not only his life, but his kids lives and everyone in their families lives too. Idiot really has gone around telling everyone Im the dad. I agreed to the test and told him he may as well quit his job and just vanish after this because its gonna be real embarrassing when I walk in with the paperwork and wave it around saying Im not the daddy to his red headed child and he has to explain to everyone including his own children what an absolute idiot he is.

Our friends have been giving me the cold shoulder all day, pretty much saying yeah they dont think Im the dad for sure but Im a trash friend for going straight to his wife and getting him thrown out of his own house and being forced to sleep in his truck and that I shouldve just agreed to the paternity test to begin with instead of stirring up drama and getting unnecessary people involved, but its one thing if he decided he wanted one for himself, but he expected me to not only get one but pay my own way and just not say anything? But yeah. Im the trash friend and trash person I guess.

Edit to add: Ill definitely update here or make a new post when the time rolls around. Trying to get it done Monday or even Tuesday at the latest because its all over Facebook now. Roberts family is doing nothing but slandering Danielle and Im being mocked for having the reverse version of a beard (like when a man uses a woman as a cover so people dont know hes actually gay) and its causing issues now with Elliots family because their logic is well they wouldnt be so sure if there wasnt proof my family is 100% with me and knows I absolutely have zero interest in women. Even if I did, Im not a cheater.

Edit: I dont know how many edits Im allowed to do without confusing people, so I made a new post. EDIT TO THIS EDIT: my new post is showing as removed/deleted, it doesnt on my end so Im assuming Reddit error. Ill update it here and separate with \_\_\_\_\_ hopefully it doesnt get removed.

EDIT AGAIN: I cant comment or post anything now here. I think Ive been banned.

&gt;*Wtf is wrong with them, dude was trying to street fight you and basically ruin your relationship, but your trash for telling your friend something that definitely would have gotten back to her...? He was calling her a whore and smearing her name, just disrespecting their vows and entire marriage. Honestly wtf is wrong with him, why wouldn't he want a mini version of his wife when he has so many of himself? My siblings look exactly like my mom and I look different, but no one accused my mom of sleeping around, especially since I resembled my dads great aunt. Dude just doesn't understand genetics and I hope he takes a test for himself, otherwise he'll ride around town looking for more redheads.* [\[link\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/uuw0im/comment/i9ht8fz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

 

&gt;*I dont know why people havent suggested this yet but you need to email HR and inform them that not only is he calling you and verbally threatening you and messaging you texts threatening violence, hes also been threatening you at work also.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*Inform HR first then inform your manager. Tell your manager you are afraid for your safety and you are considering going to the police to get a restraining order against him.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*I dont know why people havent suggested that and why this isnt being taken as seriously as it should. Hes threatening to beat you and Eff you up. WHILST YOU ARE AT YOUR PLACE OF WORK. Seriously, hes incredibly unstable right now. Hes losing everything.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*HR. Now. Also call the non emergency police line and tell them about these threats, not only in person but you have all of this in text and voice mail too. Atleast then you have a paper trail.*

[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/user/McGhostShadow/comments/uxw60k/this_is_the_previous_post_and_the_update_to_said/)**, posted to OP's own page on May 26th 2022.**

The paternity test has been scheduled for this Thursday, but the woman I spoke with over the phone informed me theyre a bit backed up right now for the actual processing of their tests, so the 3-4 business day wait is actually more like 5-7 right now. Regarding my coworkers, Ive had a mixture of being approached and doing the approaching to figure out why everyone flipped on the dime the way they had at work considering weve all been friends for so long.

I was wrong in my initial post that Robert was only complaining to me about Danielle and his paranoid suspicions. I was just getting the filtered version. Hed been gaging my responses, trying to trip me up and intimidate me into a confession from what Ive gathered.

What got me was these paranoid thoughts have been going on for a better part of two years, roughly since I became a permanent fixture in the girlfriend night. Robert was suspicious of me because I apparently dont act or look like a gay man should. Theres no guide book to being gay for starters. Me Personally that just didnt make sense, considering this man has seen me in a unicorn onesie (the full length body ones, not the baby type looking ones), getting face masks applied, and having my hair done by his wife and the other ladies. I cant wear nail polish, have false nails/lashes, or wear jewelry to work because of safety and sanitation or else I would.

A few coworkers did enlighten me that when Danielle got pregnant with Chelsea, Robert started making weird jokes that this one may come out a redhead with how much Danielle hangs out with me, but he slowly started changing, seemed like he genuinely meant it, grasping at straws when our work friends would call him paranoid, claiming hed come home to the bed all rumpled up as if they dont have three big dogs that exclusively sleep in their bed with them. Hed sworn that hed caught us kissing on more than one occasion (yet never confronted us?) Ive at most given Danielle a peck on the cheek, I have a thing about kissing anyone besides Elliot, even my own parents and siblings. Swore that we were always acting like intimate lovers, so much so that he apparently has DOZENS of messages from people frequently messaging him asking if they were divorcing because of us. I personally dont believe that for a second because hes a confrontational guy. Doesnt think before he acts kinda deal.

What has new drama unfolding is that when Roberts over analyzing searching for any legitimate proof turned up with nothing he saw in person, he put up cameras.

I didnt know at any point cameras had been installed, Danielle never mentioned them, but they had been for quite some time. Little ones in the book cases around the living area, their bedroom, kitchen, and dining area. I did know about the ones on the garage, back door and the ring camera, waved or flipped them off playfully plenty and yelled weird stuff at them. I wouldnt have minded as much if the conversations the five of us were having werent sensitive topics and meant to remain just between us.

I dont even discuss things in person with Elliot about whats said, if they wanted him to know, theyd tell him themselves. I know what its like to have secrets violated and voiced without my consent. My cousin was the one to tell our family Im gay, I was terrified despite coming from a very liberal family. Our friends dont come from very accepting families like mine.

I reached out to Danielle to confirm it as more than a rumor. She called me and did confirm the locations I listed above. All of these locations (save for the bedroom) are areas we mostly hang out to have these conversations.

I asked if they had audio, she admitted they did, but that she doesnt even have access to them and theyre linked to an app on Roberts phone only he has access to. I asked what she meant by that and she emptied her guts in tears that a few months before she got pregnant, he confronted her about her friendship with me, several times in fact, none of this I heard and the reasoning was, because he didnt trust her with any male friends, hardly liked her talking to her own male family members. For her to prove herself that shes loyal to him, her phone was set up to where text messages she received and sent also went to his phone, he had all her passwords to all her apps like she was a child needing supervision on the internet.

Didnt matter to him, he still wanted her to drop me, when she refused over his personal insecurities, especially since he has many sisters who arent actually related to him, hed decided right then and there we were having an affair and got cameras installed.

She told me she didnt give me a heads up because she was worried if I knew the cameras were there, Id confront him, hed leave, and she couldnt afford the house or taking care of the boys alone and once she got pregnant again, she definitely couldnt afford it anymore. I asked her if hed accused her from the start of Chelsea not being his and she admitted that he kept bouncing back and forth on accepting that shes his and then pulling a 180 saying he knows shes not.

When we had girls nights in and out while Robert would have guys nights out or go over to a buddys house to play cards, drink, and watch the game. Sometimes hed take the boys, other times theyd drop them off to their grandparents. I used to think they were such couples goals for that, knowing they needed not only some nights away from the kids to have their own identities, but also nights away from each other to maintain individuality. I was wrong. Hed sit over at his friends houses and just watch us in the cameras. She admitted that she knew he was watching us all the time and possibly saving the videos because hed try striking up a conversation or start making fun of us for the things wed talked about. She didnt know for sure if he was saving them, but it doesnt matter.

I told her she could have told us during a night out. There were plenty of instances and if she had explained all of this to us, made it known so we wouldnt be discussing private matters anymore. The other three women in our friend group have vented about their own martial issues, fertility struggles, trauma, family bs, etc.

To know now that hes been not only listening in on things wed shared in confidence, but also saving them to his phone to do who knows what with, show to whomever, was really upsetting. I voiced as much that we werent voicing very private matters as his source of personal entertainment and potential blackmail, that these types of conversations could result in something horrific happening to any of them. She pretty much said she cant undo it, but that shes taken down all the cameras for the time being until the tests come back.

I asked if she was seriously considering taking him back, what exactly her plan was then for when it does 100% come back hes Chelseas dad? Just to carry on like the slandering and lies didnt happen, the privacy breach didnt?

She said that hed agreed to couples counseling if it did and would make sure everyone knew the cameras were there. I felt like I was talking to an actively thickening wall, telling her that from what Ive gathered, hes alienated her from being able to vocalize her marital problems to her friends and has to walk on eggshells not only in her house because of constant surveillance she doesnt even have access to, but also her messages and texts. She claimed things would change, I dropped that conversation because we can cross that bridge in a week or so.

I told her she needs to tell the others about him having potential harmful videos on his phone of them. She tried to argue that hed never post them or send them to other people, he isnt that kind of man. I argued back that this is the same man that tried to take me outside to fight, posted all over what a wh@re she is, slandered my name, still is actively slandering us, having his family do the same and based on all the random crap theyve posted, theyve been feeding into his paranoid delusional crap hes been spouting off at them and conjuring up stories to go along with his accusations. It was a lot of back and forth, me going off on her for lying to me about knowing this was pretty much going to happen, hang ups on both ends to cool off, me ranting at Elliot about it, before she finally agreed she would tell them.

The backlash she got was pretty intense and is still an ongoing current festival of panic and fear. Two of them blocked her off everything, called/having been texting me to tell me that they just dont feel safe anymore being her friend, the third is on the fence, because she doesnt want Danielle to feel anymore alienated than she already has been, but is also worried about him posting the videos or sending them to their families out of petty revenge since she vented about an abortion she never told her VERY prolife family about that could very well get her disowned.

I understand Danielle, but I dont at the same time. I understand, since I personally have been in a romantic relationship with an abusive person, I know the desperation to be validated as telling the truth about something can be blinding to red flags of the whole picture, but I dont understand why I had to be the one to ask her about it, why she didnt immediately tell us. What if hed decided to start posting those videos all over Facebook for their partners and family to see and something awful happened to one of them? Its just a hot mess, I need a drink, and its only fing Tuesday.

[**My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/) - 28 May 2019

My wife and I are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

When I was in my 20s I donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (I literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). I've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. Always. And she has always said she's okay with it.

Fast forward to yesterday I answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" Obviously I have no idea what the fuck is going on, so I ask her to explain what she's talking about.

Turns out this girl is my daughter (I understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when I didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. After turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. She called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. Apparently my wife told her that I wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

Honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman I loved could be so fucking heartless. So for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when I was home.

I tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that I did not say any of that. We organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night I blew up at her. Honestly, I've NEVER yelled at anyone as long as I can remember, but I couldn't hold it in. 

Am I wrong to think that's so severely fucked up of my wife to do? I honestly can't comprehend how she could say that. I'm not thinking straight and need some advice on how to deal with this.

&amp;nbsp;

[**[update] My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bv0pmy/update_my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me/) - 31 May 2019 

Hesitant to post an update after how infuriating some of the replies in the previous thread were, but figure I owe it to those of you that offered genuine well meaning advice. Plus I've had some time to calm down. I probably wont reply to comments because otherwise I'm just going to get worked up again by people saying my wife didn't betray my trust etc. 

If you're a woman and are going to say it's ""understandable"" what my wife did, then consider how you'd feel if you put a kid up for adoption when you were young, that kid tried to reach out when they turned  18... And your husband told them you wanted nothing to with them without ever telling you they tried to reach out. It's not ""understandable"".

--------------------

Wife texted me yesterday and said we ""needed to talk"" while I was at work. This was the first time either of us had spoken or messaged each other since the fight. I dropped our kids off at my parents' house so we could be alone and went straight home. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting her to say, but I genuinely hoped she would at least apologise first and foremost. Because in my opinion she severely betrayed my trust by not only denying my agency, but also lying to me about it, and then downplaying the entire ordeal.

When I get home and we sit down to talk the first thing she says is that she ""forbids"" me from seeing this young woman. Not an apology. An ultimatum that if I went and saw her, she would kick me out of the house (which is laughable considering I owned the house before marrying her...)

I asked her if she was serious. If she isn't even going to apologise etc, and she reaffirmed she has nothing to apologise for. Yeah, okay. At this point I remembered someone's comment in that post about how she might have done this before. I asked her if she has ever done anything like this previously and she said no. I kept pushing her and she kept saying no. 

Finally I told her that I had already called the fertility clinic to reach out to any parents and explain what my wife had done in case they had tried to contact me previously (not sure what has come of that yet).  I explain that if I find out she has and she doesn't come clean now, I'm divorcing her immediately. She immediately changes tune and says she has ""only"" done it one other time.  ""Only"". Fuck, that ""only"" infuriated me even though it's just a god damn word.

Anyway turns out another girl called a couple years back after she turned 18 too. Her parents are lesbians and so she just wanted to meet her biological father since she doesn't have a father of her own (according to my wife, so take it with a grain of salt at this point). I tend to believe what she's saying, as the original girl also has lesbian parents and wanted to meet me for the same reason. 

She wouldn't say **exactly** what she said to this young women, but she did say she made sure she'd stay away from our family. I mean, at least my wife was finally honest with me, but Jesus Christ what a fucking heartless thing to do.

I feel like I don't even know my wife. The woman I thought I married had some fucking empathy.

She still hasn't apologised and goes back to ""forbidding"" me from seeing this young woman. I explained she no longer has a say in the matter. Had she explained her concerns to me like an adult, I would have listened to them and taken them seriously. But by trying to deny me having any choice in the matter, and for being needlessly cruel to these girls, she doesn't get a say in this anymore.

I told her she has 7 days to give me a genuine apology and agree to marriage counselling, or I would call a divorce lawyer. I also reaffirmed she doesn't get a say in whether I meet with this girl, but I would consider her feelings if any future kids reach out (and she doesn't fucking lie about it).

A few hours later she ""apologised"". I say ""apologised"" in quotes because it was clearly not genuine. But whatever, it's at least an admission of guilt. So we're going to to marriage counselling and try to work through this.

Tbh though, I don't think I'll ever see her the same way again. So I have doubts our marriage will last.

[**he doesn't want children**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ycdyct/he_doesnt_want_children/) - (24 Oct 2022)

Last night, my husband told me that he doesn't want to have children. He cried and cried and told me that he's known for sure for a while but didn't know how to tell me because he knows how important it is to me. We've been together for 9 years, married for 2 years, and although he's been depressed for the past year (difficult career stuff happening for him), I thought things were on track. He's said many times that it wasn't a good time for a baby, or that it made him nervous, but never ever that he didn't want them.

I'm devastated. I cried and raged and called him a liar. He says he's been lying to himself all this time. I cried myself to sleep and he got up early and went to work without waking me. I'm 37, I feel strongly about having a baby very soon. The thought of never having one breaks my heart. But so does leaving my marriage. I love my husband so much - I would move mountains for him. And I'm so so so angry and sad.

Is there any way to move forward? I simultaneously want to hold him and punch him right now. I don't know what to do or how to feel.

&amp;nbsp;

[Update to ""he doesn't want children.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/yglb8p/update_to_he_doesnt_want_children/) - (30 Oct 2022)

I posted Monday about my husband telling me out of nowhere that he never wants children (I do.) It's been a sad, difficult week, but I have made some decisions and taken action.

First off, thanks to everyone who offered kind, supportive advice. I have come to the sad realization that I would rather live without my husband than without a child of my own. I am taking steps to leave.

I've made an appointment with an OB for a few weeks from now, to discuss my fertility and options for becoming a single parent.

I'm working with a realtor to buy a house on my own! This is so exciting to me, I've been wanting to buy for ages and had too much instability to do it before now.

There are a lot of little details to work out, and the actual divorce is probably a ways off (because reasons, none of your business.) But in spite of the deep sadness I feel, I think I'm making the right decision. The two friends I've told have been completely supportive and think I'm doing the right thing. Even my husband thinks I'm doing the right thing, although it's clear he's in a lot of pain. He's even offered to help me buy a new bed and things when I move out (too hard to get ours out of our current rental.)

So I'm sad, but moving forward with hope.

Finally, to everyone who said I'm too old to have kids, go fuck your self.

Posted on r/relationshipadvice by u/ThrowRAjocolo

Original Post: July 29 2022

(throwaway because he is on Reddit Though not this subreddit I dont think) I apologize if the formatting is acting up

So pretty much what the titles says. He said I traumatized him for no reason and I made him nauseas, and when I said that I felt the same he said it wasnt the same because women do it all the time.

To be clear, this view is solely around this, and though he agree it is horrible and arduous and has even offer to pay for therapy throughout my pregnancy and after. He doesnt agree that it is enough reason to avoid doing this together

I disagree, since he wont have any part of the childbirth only the making.

We have more than enough saved for a surrogate due to my inheritance. (More than enough to pay her even better than the average.) He said it wouldnt feel like his child unless I did it naturally. And that it was something that I should want to experience as a women.

Now after I showed him the pictures he says I ruined the experience for him

I dont want this to be the end, we are great in every other area of our relationship, and I feel like the underlying reason he wasnt me to carry, is for a bonding experience. But I have a lot of reproductive trauma from horrendous periods for the last 15 years of my life, and FINALLY found a treatment this year, My first year ever without crippling pain. And I just cant imagine adding more, or maiming myself when there is another way.

I think he thinks I will change my mind. But this is a hard line for me. I dont want to divorce him, we both want children that isnt the issue&but I will if I need to, because I wont be manipulated in to giving in to doing this.

I would love some advice from women on how they might have discussed something like this with their husbands, and mens opinions on how to explain this to him?

EDIT: to be clear, tearing is not my only, fear. It was simply the only visual representation that I could find to attempt to make him understand. I have not intention of getting pregnant, after finally finding a pain free existence after 15 years, partially simply due to the trauma I have compiled in that time. That means, no. I do not want a scheduled c-section either.

EDIT: Also, I dont appeciate people looking down on the lovely women who are surrogates. Some are friends that have offered, because they loved being pregnant so much, but dont want to have anymore children themselves. One commenter here even stated she would surrogate to keep other women from going through what she when to and had been looking into doing so. Another one of my friends has a literal pregnancy kink. So I would appreciate if people stopped judging things they clearly dont understand.

EDIT: I am looking into adoption, I have always wanted to adopt. I started preemptively on the documents too. However it is a extremely long, uncertain and drawn out process that the government makes only more difficult. It can take years and years, and still remain uncertain.

UPDATE POSTED: August 2 2022 (four days later) on r/relationshipadvice

I spoke to him again, and hes doubling down on the fact that he doesnt think this is an issue, as woman Go through it all the time even though I told him that his is hard line, and that I would never expect him to give up his body for something I wanted, especially something that wasnt even necessary to reach the same point Ei. a child. He just got angry at me.

So I brought him to my therapy session this morning, hoping that we would be able to speak to him together to help him understand, as my therapist stated that it would be a danger to my mental health, if I were too compound that experience with my past traumas as it can be a trigger. (I suffered mild accuse stress disorder from the experiences with pain I had). Ive never seen my therapist frustrated, but he was so flippant about his views, even though we listen calmly to his reasons about it being a couples bonding time etc. And I explained why it wouldnt be that because I would be so anxious the entire time, He said, especially that he was sure I would enjoy it once it was happening because I clearly wanted children and loved them. Eventually my therapist asked him if he cared about the impact I may have on me and his response was why would it have a lasting impact, women do it every day and when she said that it had lasting impacts on them to, and that a number of women would take this option if they could&he literally got up and walked out. And stopped responding for a couple hours.

he messaged me an 30 mins ago like nothing had happened and asked if I want him to grab me a burrito for lunch on his way back.

I was just in such disbelieve that that would be the first thing he said after how he acted that I texted back \[no. Id prefer you didnt come back.\] which I felt instantly terrible about, so I added that it might just be better for him to stay with his brother for a couple days.

He is currently blowing up my phone but I really dont want to answer and I honestly not sure I want him to come back

I feel like I married a man who loved me more than thinking I should just be able to do something because women do it all the time.Im honestly debating contacting a lawyer, but I dont know if Im over reacting. I dont know how I can fix this. Even my therapist looked disappointed in him. And Im passed disappointed, Im disgusted.

He knew when we married I might not want to get pregnant. I just dont know when he stopped caring about me as a person.

Hopefully he will be able to stay at his brothers, as end on speaking to my therapist again before coming to any final conclusions but I feel like when you start looking up divoarce lawyers on your phone its not a good sign and I dont know how to come back from how hes treating me.

I dont know if Im ranting or asking a question, but again if anything has any suggestions, that would be great.

Im not sure if this link is working but here is the context/original to this:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/wbdbvw/i\_told\_my\_husband\_i\_couldnt\_mentally\_handle\_the/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/wbdbvw/i_told_my_husband_i_couldnt_mentally_handle_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

EDIT: can peope stop suggestions c-sections, as if its some magical thing I havent heard of before? That is another option for birth, not pregnancy.

EDIT: if you read my first post I have suggested Surrogacy and I have the money to pay it myself. For some reason he just wants to experience me being pregnant.

EDIT: I think Im going to stop responding. My last post did help because some suggested to bring him to therapy with me, and even though it didnt work out the way I wanted it did give me clarity on his views. But All the people suggesting c-sections as an option to someone who has past reproductive pain and reproductive medical trauma related ptsd need to reevaluate there beliefs. If multiple therapist have told me I likely would not be a good choice for me then Im going with their suggestion.

Some clarity for people:

\-he knew about my trauma prior to marriage and that I was 50/50 about birthing children myself.

\-a couple freinds have offered to be surogates because they enjoyed being pregnant but dont want anymore children, one, because she has a pregnancy kink. So, Id appreciate if people didnt suggest I was trafficking them, as if they cant make this choice for themselves

\-I can pay for the surrogacy, I have an inheritance that is solely mine. Also yes, I have also offered adoption.

\-bottom line. I do want children.

Relevant comments made on the update:

u/Rip_Dirtbag: So did the conversation of having children never come up before? If youre as militant about not getting pregnant as these two posts suggest, then I cant imagine any human being would know you for 5 minutes without being fully aware of your stance on this issue. How is gods name did your husband not know?

OOPs response: I do want children. He was always aware of the fact that I was 50/50 on caring. I even froze my eggs Prior to surgery to fix my pain. I have also begun on adoption documents because they take so long (Which he was aware of).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

u/Infinite-Hearing-738: Then why is he trying to make you carry a pregnancy now if he's always known you don't want to? Seems like he did a bait and switch on you.

OOPs response: It does feel that way a bit. I dont understand why it means so much to him now. I dont know if he had it in his head that just because I retained my fertility after my surgery that it meant I would suddenly want to, and ease my whole past Because I am physically capable.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

u/wernercd: C-Section an option? His attitude is obviously horrible and is going to be an issue going forward but there is the alternative to ""natural"" birth.

And his horrible attitude? Would probably be a really good reason to separate. Don't get me wrong, I have a ""you're tougher than you think, buck up and push through"" attitude with stuff myself but he's taking that to a level even I don't think I could approach. You've talked to him... you've had a neutral third party join the conversation... and he's still acting like you aren't serious and you can just ignore these fears?

This seems to be a major issue for you and this could definitely be a deal breaker for your relationship.

OOPs response: I dont want to get or be pregnant. I would get a tubal if I didnt have so much trauma preventing me from having any remotely invasive reproductive procedure like that. And I doubt that will be on the table for years to come.

The reason surrogacy is on the table is because I had a feeling I wouldnt be able to do anymore of this and got my eggs frozen before my last big procedure, it was also in question whether I would be able to retain my fertility, so it was a precaution.

2ND (and possibly FINAL)UPDATE POSTED: August 2 2022 (four days later) on r/RelationshipAdvice

I think this will be the final update since he came back to the house that night , despite me asking for space and he laid into me the immedietly the instant he saw me. There was lots of suggesting I wasnt being a good wife and that I wouldnt be a good real mother lots of him calling selfish &amp; a coward for not being willing to actually bond with my child like other women do everyday. He also brought up me trying to manipulate him with my therapist.

I told him to leave, multiple times, until I got angry too and asked him how a exactly his experience of making of a child would be any different whether he ejaculated into a container or into me and how if he took issue with thisif I could ever trust him to love a child we adopted (which was something we had always spoken of doing.)

(this is all paraphrasing as there was a lot going on.)

He got so angry he was literally red in the face, and just and reiterated much of the same. to which I told him to leave *again*, and he told me no he wouldnt leave, and that I had to listen, because I was being so selfish and ruining everything.

That was about when the police showed up (one of our neighbours had called). He tried to tell the police they it was fine, but I said I didnt want him there in front of them, and that he needed to calm down away from me. So with the polices suggestion he finally left.

Its been a couple days, blocked him yesterday after an influx of insults and name-calling texts. I still feel very numb, however that tends to be my reaction to high stress situations.

I feel like a idiot because I thought we could work this out since we he had been okay with this when it had been an option when we got together. Wed discussed it so many times and still had the same goals in life, etc, and because I would never have asked this of him if it was the other way around&I honestly didnt think this would break us. But Ive ever seen that side of him and I have no intention of ever seeing it again.

I will be contacting an attorney, also maybe change the locks, as the house is technically mine.

I wasnt sure I was going to post again, but there have been a lot of kind people and your reassurance really did help me, I really wish this was better than I think it will end up going. Im sorry if this was hard to follow, im still a bit shaken And it feels like a bit like Im in the eye of a storm Atm. i think I posted this wrong the first time&I wont be fixing it again..

 Notable cooments made on the 2ND UPDATE

u/Smoozagoozle: I dont think anything you could say would have ever worked. He wanted what he wanted and thats the only way he wanted it.

I mean, to the point that he was throwing a literal tantrum to get it. Mind you, he was throwing said tantrum to get you to be pregnant. There is something genuinely fucked up with him

It was very out of character. ive never seen him act that way, it was a bit sureal.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

u/Foolish5678: Ugh he just keeps getting worse and worse each time to post. Why is he so set on this? Why is he so set on you giving birth? Is he hoping youll die so he can collect life insurance on you or something? I dont fucking get it

When the time comes, you will be a great mother with hopefully a much better spouse then he is.

I am glad you were able to remove him from your house. Definitely have all communication done through attorneys from here on out, the man does not sound rational at all.

Stay safe OP and I wish you well !

The more I think about it the less I understand. . He gave absolutely no other reason except this bonding belief. And I dont know why he seems to think bonding is only achieved during a pregnancy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Deleted: (-153 downvotes) He freaked out, and was wrong in acting so extremely. You were also clearly trying to manipulate him. So you're both better off alone.

How is trying to help him understand why what he was asking would be dangerous for me, with a mediator in the room manipulation? When he clearly wasnt understanding when I explained it.

So adoption is pretty common in my family. I probably have more adopted cousins than biological ones, tho I cant say for sure since it really doesnt matter in my family. My (22M) younger brother (15M) was adopted by my parents when he was 7, our dads were close and he used to come round a lot.

His dad then passed due to medical issues when he was 7 and my parents took him in because he would have gone into the system.

So hes lived with us since I was 14 and I do see him as my little brother and we are family. His bio mom is still around but isnt allowed to see him.

The problem comes in with my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years and weve met each other's families and we have gotten in great with them. About a month ago she came to me complaining about how her sister is adopting. Saying it was cheating especially since she doesnt have any fertility issues. I told her that it doesnt matter if the kid is adopted or not and that my brother is adopted. She didnt say anything else to me about it after that. However she has stopped calling my brother my brother, she just calls him by his name.

Yesterday she and her friend (who is also my friend and introduced us) and was talking about she is so happy that my parents will be her in-laws. He agreed and said that my parents and my brother would make great in-laws, she then corrected him and told him that my brother wouldnt be her in-law since hes adopted. He had no idea how to respond and ended up telling me about it. This caused an argument between us with me saying my brother is my brother and her insisting that he isnt and that there is a difference. She told me to sleep somewhere else that night. I told her no, this is my home too and if she has the issue she should sleep somewhere else. This caused her to scream at me, calling me manipulative and abusive before leaving to sleep at her parents.

Her dad, who I really get along with has asked to speak with me and Ive gotten some aggressive messages from some other members of her family. I didnt think I was in the wrong but with so many people upset with me I think I might be. I brought it up so maybe I should have left, so AITA?","AmItheAsshole",9695,9695,0,0.97,8,0,1,1253

Nobody in my family knew this until recently but a while back I (27M) donated sperm to make some money. Guessing you know where this is going. 

Months ago my brother Chris and his wife Janette talked to me about them deciding to have a baby by using artificial insemination. My brother has problems with fertility. They did treatment for 2 years. Then they decided on adoption when that didnt work. Then the parents changed their mind and kept the baby. Basically theyve been threw it and just want to have a baby.

They found out Im a donor because they looked on the same site. None of my personal info is on it except for a childhood picture of me and some vague info of what I studied in school and stuff. But obviously Chris recognized me. And they both sat me down pretty much to ask for my blessing about using my sperm. I said no. Theres no way Id be comfortable with something like that. Yeah I donated sperm because I needed money but any child born from thag would never be part of my personal life. Not at least for like 18 years or ever if they dont reach out. 

Id see this kid constantly because our family gets together almost 2-3 times a month. My brother lives 5 minutes from me. And then I said its just plain weird for my own SIL to be injected with *my* sperm, carry a kid thats biologically mine. Then one day that kid finds out their uncle is their biological father. Just&no. They were put off by my answer. But never brought it up again so I thought that was it.

Months later they announced theyre pregnant. Everyone knows they used a donor. What none of us knew is that they still went with using MINE. My brother was distant for a while until he came out and told me the truth because he was starting to feel bad and the babys going to be here soon. 

I felt a rush of so many emotions but most of all I was angry. And yeah I did call them selfish and crazy because did they didnt consider how this would affect the child when they found out about their biological dad. How would that affect them mentally. And also what it would do to *me* seeing my biological child all the time. How that would fuck with my mind. SIL was crying, my brother got mad at me for insulting them after everything they've gone through.

My parents know everything now and theyre involved. First they are pretty upset with my brother for going along knowing they didnt have my okay. But they think I didnt have a right to judge who they are as parents. My brother especially thinks Im an asshole because its not my place to decide who they used as a donor since Im the one who donated in the first place.

They are right I dont have a right to decide what they do. Its just so fucking bizarre and Im feeling a lot. But does it make me an asshole for still basically insulting them as parents?","AmItheAsshole",9438,9438,0,0.96,9,0,2,1681

My husband brought 3 people he barely knows to live with us because family and Ive been playing maid for the past 3 months



Im stuck cleaning up after 5 people now because my husband decided to bring 3 people from out of the country to come live with us without even talking to me about it. One is his 17 year old cousin he brought literally on his way home and let me know when they were 3 hours away from our house and the other 2 are newly weds, one of which is another cousin of his, who he hid was coming from me until the DAY I WAS SCHEDULED TO BE INDUCED TO HAVE OUR SECOND BABY. He never told me when they were showing up and 6 hours after having my baby, my ring camera goes off to show me 2 strangers knocking on my door. It was them. Surprise surprise. I cried my ass off.


I ended up staying at my moms house for a month after because why the fuck would I want to stay in a house with 3 strangers i barely know while Im recovering from childbirth and they kept telling my cousin they dont know why I was avoiding them and asking him if I dont like them or am mad at them.


Theyre disgusting, they never clean up after themselves. Im responsible for taking the wife places even though I never signed up for this shit. We have to buy all the food and supplies for the house and these people had the audacity to say they want to keep snacks separated from us because of our 5 year old. But theyre more than welcome to use all our food whenever they feel like it but my daughter cant eat one of their rice krispy treats.


Ive been cleaning up after all of them for 3 months now and I cant do it anymore. My house is disgusting, they broke my washer because theyre always doing laundry and I never get to do laundry because its always full and when I put anything in the dryer, it gets taken out before its done so I end up having to rewash all of it. I have 7 laundry baskets full of clothes to catch up on.


They also talk about me behind my back and the wife only ever talks to me when she needs something. I Already have to clean up After my disorganized husband who leaves chips bags, wrappers and crumbs everywhere and now I have to clean up after a teenager who we cant get rid of and a newly wed couple who spends most the day fucking in my daughters room because and where theyre staying.


I know I have an SO problem and I have tried talking to him about this but just like with any other conversation, its like he tunes me out as soon as he hears my voice. I cant bring up his cousin wife anymore because my husband always defends her fiercely and we end up fighting about it.


I even got her a job with my aunt and she hasnt been two work in two weeks and my aunt only did this favor because I asked and his cousins wife kept moaning and crying about wanting to work but not being able to find a job.


Im at my wits end and with having a new born and a 5 year old, I have mental breakdowns everyday because Im constantly cleaning and Im at the point I want to divorce my husband because I cant believe he did something so fucking selfish. He didnt once consider my feelings or comfort with all of this. He didnt take into account that his pregnant wife might not be ok with all of this and just brought them here and expected me to just shut up.


I dont know what to do anymore.


Update #1: Ive been reading through all the comments and just wanted to answer some questions I saw. No, my husband was actually not like this before. Were in the process of building our dream home and before that he was a fantastic husband. He also owns his own business and has actually started therapy a couple months ago because he told me he feels incredibly depressed from all the stress hes been dealing with. Before the house build, he helped around the house, he helped with the kids and communicated really well to me. He started changing about 5 months ago when we got past a certain phase in our house build.


Also the house we live in isnt mine or his. Its my moms house. And the kicker is we arent even paying rent here. I have my uncle living in a room in the house and he pays my mom rent and helps around the house when he can. We actually asked him to live with us because of an incident that happened a couple years back and we wanted to have another person in the house for safety. So my husband brought three people to live in a house that isnt even his to begin with.


My husbands actually way too nice when it comes to his family. He doesnt know how to say no. He went back home for the first time since he was 4 and when he got there he was immediately being asked about his life here in the US because his family thinks hes super rich and has it easy. Thats when the teenager was thrown on us and the teenager is actually a US citizen so my husband felt like he couldnt say no. I guess the teen went back and told his cousin how easy it is here and the other cousin is also a us citizen and began to call my husband everyday asking for help to get to us. It was literally every single day at 6 pm and hed be on the phone with him for hours. My ILs were pissed when they found out he was going to be helping them and tried to convince him not to help but he didnt listen.


I was the one who said the couple couldnt come when we move into our new home. I can get the teen to clean and help, its easy because he gets super embarrassed when I call him out on his messes and is actually pretty apologetic. He actually isnt too much of a handful and is always willing to help. Its the couple thats been the problem really.


I did give him an ultimatum and he did choose us so theyre aware that they arent coming with us when we move. We most next week so they should be out by next Friday.


My husband asked me this morning if something was wrong and I told him everything I wrote on here and emphasized that he is the problem and how incredibly hurt I was that he never took me into consideration when he made these decisions. He said we could take a break and he would leave for a little bit so we could figure out what our next steps are and I could get some space but Im not letting him do that. Id end up being here with his family and theyre not my problem theyre his. I cant go to my moms because my mom has two people from her home country staying there that we also barely know because she felt bad for them and they needed a place to stay so Im stuck here and am moving into my new home next week by myself with the kids.



[Update 1 month later](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/slq8iy/update_my_husband_brought_3_people_the_barely/)



So a lot happened in the last month. The couple didnt find a place to live. They started stressing about how they were gonna be homeless and stuff and my husband guilt tripped me into letting them live with us. So yeah they moved into our new house and they were super super happy.


At first everything was ok. They stayed out of my way and I didnt bother them because I was bitter and busy moving. Eventually, I thought ok, Im gonna live with these people so let me try and get along with the wife. We actually got along pretty ok. My aunt ended up firing her because she stopped going to work so she was at home literally all day. And she didnt do shit to contribute. She never cleaned or cooked or helped around the house but I was like ok whatever as long as she isnt making a mess.


Eventually she made an appointment at a womens clinic for some fertility issues she was having and she asked me to take her and I said sure whatever. So I was taking her to her appointments and spending more time with her and we were really getting along.


Now mind you, theyre not paying rent yet. I was cooking all our dinners on the weeknights and lunch and dinner on the weekends and still cleaning up afterwards by myself. I would wake up at 5 am, make breakfast for my family, clean, make lunch, clean, make dinner and then stay awake til midnight and clean. Her routine was wake up around 12 pm, make a coffee, eat breakfast, go to her room and come out when her husband got home so they could eat my dinner. I was getting burnt out but it was the most solid my marriage has ever been. I was cleaning and cooking and he was helping me with the kids and helping around the house. This lasted like 2 weeks.


Today my daughter had my husbands phone, I noticed it on the couch and this man never goes without his phone. I got curious because he will not post shit about me on social media so I wanted to see if he finally had. He hasnt but I noticed he had a couple of girls I didnt know as new Instagram friends. So I go to his post youve liked and notice this girls pictures. Hes liked all her pictures even her most recent being like 2 weeks ago and I go to her profile and notice that shes from where his cousin and wife are and that cousins wife is the only mutual friend they have.


I got curious and thought Im gonna go through cousins wifes WhatsApp messages with my husband because theres nooooo way they havent discussed this girl. Low and behold, she told him about this girl. She sent my husband a screenshot of this girls Facebook profile and my husband was like whats that? And she was like oh I meant to send it to the other cousin but my husband gave me the wrong number my bad. And my husband goes wait shes gorgeous send it again so I can look her up and cousins wife says no I dont want any problems and he goes no send it and tell her Im gonna add her and stuff so she doesnt get shy because I know how girls in your country can be. And she goes ok and sends him the screenshot again and starts telling him about her and what shes like. Then she says oh shes 18 tho and he goes ok does she have an older sister or something? And she goes yeah she does and hes like well send me hers too and she sends it to him too and he adds her too and then he screenshots that the first girl accepted the friend request and sends it to cousins wife the these emojis ===


And cousins wife thinks its super funnyand basically ends the convo with ""dont worry itll stay between us 3 lol""


So he added her on Facebook and then went and still wanted to add her on Instagram.


So, these fuckers, living in my house rent free, Im cooking and cleaning for them, taking her to appointments and shit, being a maid for all of them, have the audacity to do some shit like this. Dont even feel one lick of remorse. So I confronted my husband, he blamed me and said that it was because he was stressed because of building and because I was staying with my mom after the baby so he did something stupid and I wasnt being a good wife and that now that I finally am, he didnt want to ruin anything. He doesnt think she owes me an apology and he doesnt think he does either because it was just a friend request. 


So I kicked them all out. I kicked him, the cousin, the wife and the teen out. The teen I felt bad but he was just there and hes my husbands responsibility. My in laws came to pick up the couple and after screaming at them and my MIL calling the wife a bunch of names, took them to their house and apologized for their family causing me issues. I am now going to separate from my soon to be ex husband, sell my dream home, use the cash to buy a house for me and my daughters.


They dont think theyve done anything wrong. Cousins wife says that she told my husband she didnt want any problems so she doesnt feel like she messed up. Husband is still feverishly defending them and doesnt want me to confront them so theres probably more to all of this but at this point I dont care.



*OP adds in a comment:*


She wanted us to let her get a dog. She thought she should be allowed to and her idea was that shed put a diaper on the dog or put down pads and shed get a teacup type so it wouldnt bother us.


Little does she know that when they first got here, her husband complained about how he used to always step on dog poop and pee back home because she never cleaned up after the dogs. Why the hell would I let you bring a dog in when I know for a fact you wont clean up after him. Also a diaper on a dog and doggy pads?? Like how fucked up dude.





*a commenter asks:*


&gt;So & you are leaving him&right?


OP: Yes its over.



*ETA OP just left a short update in a comment today, July 23. Thanks to u/ProductivePete for letting me know!*


OP: I did leave him but we still arent divorced because in my state you have to be separated for a certain amount of time before you can even file so hes still technically my husband.","BestofRedditorUpdates",9264,9264,0,0.97,2,0,0,432

[FINAL UPDATE] 

Hello, thank you to everyone who has sent me chats/messages supporting me and asking how I'm doing. I do have an update.

1. I gave birth to my son in the beginning of April. He is healthy and I had no health complications.
2. At the end of March I was able to get temporary full physical and legal custody of my kids.
3. My 14 year old daughter asked me if I'd be willing to do family therapy with her and her dad. I did not want to do it. I fought it, but eventually I chose to do so for the sake of my daughter and her need to process everything and hopefully move on.
4. I learned a LOT more about the relationship between my ex and my egg donor due to homework the therapist gave us. My ex did reveal more things which I believe to be true:
   1. My mom had actually tried to seduce him well before we were of age. From my ex's recollection when my egg donor took over the youth group I was 15 and he was a few months from turning 15. The grooming began then. She'd counsel him ""privately"" because he needed it. They kissed at some point when he was still 14 and that was all they did (meaning they'd make out during these sessions) until he turned 18. It was right around the time of the first kiss that my mom convinced him to ask me out and date me so they could keep seeing each other without suspicion. At this revelation, I was both devastated (my entire relationship was built on a lie and my husband never loved me and also a sense of relief knowing that I had absolutely nothing to do with their affair.) The reason I believe this is true is that when he asked me out, I had to get permission from my parents to date. At the time the rule was no one could date before age 16. My mom went to bat for me, or so I thought. We started dating right after he turned 15. The timeline adds up.  **EDITED:** My dad is currently looking into potential other cases of abuse and manipulation right now with the help of the church officials, nothing has turned up, and truthfully while I hate my egg donor, I find it hard to believe she'd have the stamina to carry on multiple affairs with other boys. I think she seduced him knowing I liked him and wanted to feel superiority over me? Looking back all of this makes sense, her treatment of me, and my children in relationship to her other grandkids. I think all of this was a seriously fucked up case of her being narcissistic and punishing me for ""ruining her life.""
   2. The did not have full sex until he turned 18 and I guess that was his birthday present from her.
   3. My 22F and 20 M children are still not speaking to him which he has come to grips with and understands they'll likely never re-establish contact with him.
   4. The twins and I have reconciled fully.

Now for the egg donor:

After the last phone call with my aunt, I cut off contact with her and my grandmother. I was tired of my aunt trying to guilt trip me into talking to my egg donor. My grandma is a whole other problem and is beginning to show signs of dementia and senility. She is still harassing my egg donor and calling her a whore of Babylon, which I'm okay with, but the other stuff she's doing and saying is not something I want to add to my life of stress.

My 34F and 42F sister were the ones who helped me with labor and delivery plan. My ex knew what the plans were but also that I did not want him at the hospital until I had already given birth and was in a better place for him to meet his son. He agreed to this. The day I went into labor my 34F sister took my 14F and 5F children to her home while my 42F sister was with me in the room. Apparently, my 14F child needed something from the school and reached out to my ex to pick it up as he was still on the official pick up list (he no longer is) and drop it off at my sister's house. My egg donor was with him when he took the call. He refused to let her come along as I did not want my children around my egg donor. She apparently followed him in her car to the store and then my sister's house and threw a temper tantrum on the front lawn of my sister's house. My ex ""broke up"" with her and told her she was too much drama and it just wasn't worth it anymore and she flew into a rage and physically attacked him and started destroying things in my sister's yard. The cops were called my egg donor was arrested for domestic violence. At that point my ex, my sister, and I all took out orders of protection against her due to the instability and the situation.

My ex moved into an apartment close to the HVAC company. My 14 year old daughter has decided not to forgive him and told him that she didn't want to be around him currently, so only the 5 year old visits my ex. He comes to my dad's house and visits her one weeknight and one weekend evening (when I take my other kids and twin brothers out for dinner).

We've established contact through a custody app and we'll be revisiting the custody issue in June. I will be pursuing full legal and physical custody until my ex can prove to me he's done the necessary therapy and treatment he needs. I still hate my ex with everything in my being for what he did to me from the time I was 15 until recently, but I hate my egg donor far more for what she did to us all. I do have some sympathy for him and I truly want him to be okay for the sake of my younger kids. **EDITED:** Yes, he has met his newborn son. He met him the night I gave birth. I also allowed his in laws and brothers to meet him as well. His in laws and I are currently setting up plans for the 14 and 5 year old to have time with them as well as times they can come visit my newborn. My ex is allowed supervised visitation at this point (not a court ordered visitation, but my wishes which he is adhering too as he does his therapy and rehab) and he gets regular time with the 5 year old. He does get access to our newborn at least once a week (if he comes with his parents) if he wishes. He's seen his son at least six times since I gave birth and three in my presence. We're slowly rebuilding civilized communication.

As for the other divorce proceedings he's agreed to a mediated uncontested divorce and I'll be getting half of everything, including the business. I'm choosing to sell my shares to one of my ex's workers who'd like to become a partner. The ex is happy with this and I'll be happy to be completely rid of any ties to my ex.

My dad was able to sell my old house. It didn't even get listed as our realtor knew a family looking and I have begun looking for houses about 45 minutes away from my dad.

As for the egg donor: she has gone into hiding. Once the twins told her unequivocally they'd never live with her and that they wanted nothing to do with her, especially after how she got arrested, she began a whole lot of guilt tripping and blaming them. She is now contesting the divorce from my dad and only speaking to him through her lawyer.

As for my 38F sister, she got a wake up call from this whole thing when my mother called her and berated her for 45 minutes for not bailing her out of jail. Apparently, my 38F sister has been going through fertility issues (like I said I don't talk to her and had no idea) and she's been stressed out and anxious and feeling bad about herself, which is why she let our egg donor manipulate her because she felt good about herself when she was getting all the positive attention. When she wasn't willing to pay the money to bail her out as she and her partner were saving up for another cycle of IVF, she realized that she was being manipulated and reached out to me. We have begun slowly talking again, but she is on my side regarding this all. She is also talking to my dad again, which for his sake, I'm happy that he is able to reconnect with her.

Having my son (btw, we did the DNA test a few weeks before his birth he is definitely my ex's), has been a pleasure and joy and he and my other kids and my support system of my dad and siblings has gotten me through this and will continue to do so. I am hopeful that at some point I will be able to deal with my ex without anger and bitterness, seeing as he has trauma from what my egg donor did to him. I'll be okay. Like I said, this will be my last update on this. So thank you for all the kindness, love, and support!

I'm (28m) is happily married to my wife Sara (31), we have been together for over 6 years and married for 3 years. My mother Laura (45) had me pretty early on. She always wanted a big family and has been together with my dad since they were 14. After she had me, she decided to be a stay at home mother and in a space of the next 10 years had a total of 7 kids, so I have loads of siblings. She has recently announced that I am to become a brother again.

Me and Sara have been struggling to conceive for the past three years. We really would like to have a kid together and considered surrogacy, but my family kinda talked us out, saying we shouldn't trust our child some unknown woman. I have suggested my mother or my sister to become our surrogate if they are that worried, but both of them declined saying that they can't have any more children and won't be able to carry (my sister has 5 kids). And just to note I love Sara regardless if we have a child or not and willing to adopt, but she really wants us to have our own. 

Me and Sara have tried a lot of options and recently unfortunately she had another miscarriage and this was really upsetting and depressing for both of us. I have shown my support and my mother, who knew about all of our struggles and recent miscarriage, invited us out for dinner at her house yesterday, which Sara wanted to attend as she is in very good relationship with my mother. 

My entire family was there and the dinner was going well, Sara congratulated my mother on her pregnancy and I thought that will be it. Then my sister announced that she is pregnant again and basically her and my mother ended up having the ""baby talk"" really loudly where my sister was excited to have another brother and my mother wanted to have another grandchild. That was too much for Sara, so she got up and left in tears and I followed her shortly after. She had to cut off her family because they kept telling her she is not a woman for not being able to have children and is too old and this gets to her too much.

After we got home my mother called me and said Sara behaved herself very rudely and she is expecting an apology as it ""has ruined the dinner to celebrate life"". I got angry and have told her that she was completely out of line and inconsiderate for having the baby talk with my sister when she knew Sara had another miscarriage and her ""life celebration"" dinner made things a lot worse for both Sara and I. I have also said that if she told us what the dinner was we would not have came. At the end I was called an asshole for ""not appreciating another life being born"".

AITA?

Edit: just to point out. My mother has told me and Sara that the dinner was to support her after the miscarriage. In no way or form she mentioned about this being about ""celebration of life"", pregnancy announcement, fertility lottery and babies. If it was the case and we were aware about it we wouldn't have came.","AmItheAsshole",8704,8704,0,0.96,8,0,0,760

**My MIL DNA tested our daughter and told my husband she isnt his**

**TW mention of SA**

My 45 F husband 48M and I have been together for 25 years, we have three kids F8, M15, and F17. My husband and I had a lot of trouble conceiving our daughter we went through several years with no luck and had seen a fertility doctor who had prescribed some medication to help with ovulation. We couldnt afford IVF so we were going to try this last thing and then look into adoption. 

Well long story short I was SAd during a burglary while my husband was out with his brother, it was right when I was to be ovulating. At the hospital I took EC even though I knew it would undo all the hard work (medication) and mean we wouldnt be able to have a baby of our own, but I couldnt risk getting pregnant with my Rwords baby. 


Well after a few months Ive been feeling off, sick, down I figured I was just depressed after the SA and I hadnt been eating. But I soon found out I was pregnant. We were so excited until I went to my appointment and found out I was 15 weeks instead of the 5/6 weeks I thought I was. I had been having really irregular spotting/bleeding since the EC, so didnt even imagine I was that far along. 


My husband and I were devastated because that meant there was so much uncertainty surrounding paternity. We had our ultrasound and as soon as we saw the baby on the screen I knew I couldnt have an abortion and my husband didnt want to either. We talked and talked and went back-and-forth about adoption and if the baby didnt end up being his or what we would do and he said he didnt care about paternity we just wouldnt find out, we decided to wait until our child was older to tell them and they could decide if they wanted to find out themselves. I will also note at this point my case was unsolved but had been linked to other SAs/ murders at the time. A few years ago my rapist was caught and a year ago finally sentenced. At the hearing I spoke and my daughter and son knew about it but I didnt go into details, but they knew I was attacked but only knew it was before they were born. 


Last Christmas my MIL bought my daughter and only my daughter a 23 and me for Christmas. I thought it was extremely weird but didnt think too much of it, thinking back I dont know why I didnt see it for what it was. My daughter was equally confused and asked if I wanted to do it instead, Im adopted. I said sure and just gave my daughter an Amazon gift card for the price of the test. My daughter brought it to my attention that my MIL has been overly critical of my daughter in the last few months commenting on her differences. Saying things like I wonder where those eyes came from, hair, height, she even said to my daughter I wonder why youre so skinny. 


My daughter looks exactly like me the same eyes color, same hair color and texture but she is quite a bit taller than me Im 58 shes 6 ft. Im on the heavier side so is my husband and my daughter is extremely thin but she is also an athlete. Ive never had any reason to believe from looks alone that she is not my husbands daughter. After my daughter brought it to my attention how my MIL was acting. I spoke with her and she said oh shes just being sensitive. This was a couple months ago. 


A couple nights ago my MIL invited my husband and I out for dinner and told us to leave the kids at home because she had something important to discuss with us we did we went to a restaurant were eating and my MIL hands me and my husband two separate envelopes, my husband and I both look in the envelope and they are a DNA comparison results. I asked my MIL what it was and she said the proof that youre the garbage I always knew you were. I was extremely confused, I asked whos DNA she compared and as I said that I just knew, shes said my husband and my daughter. My husband looked at me and he looked so hurt and lost, Ill never get that image out of my head as long as I live. I called her a heartless c*nt and my husband and I left. I blocked her number from mine and my kids phones, but figured my husband needed to make that decision on his own.
 

My husband told me last night my MIL called him and he stopped by after work at her house, she was telling my husband shes known for awhile and suspected for a very long time and that she wasnt sure how to approach the topic with him. My husband asked how she knew that she said she over heard my BIL talking to his wife and heard our daughter may not be his. My MIL took that to mean that I cheated, so she did a DNA test.  Last year around the hearing my husband got drunk and ended up mentioning the hearing and some details to my BIL. 


Apparently that night while sleeping he said I couldnt protect her and what if shes not mine. My husband was extremely drunk and did not remember doing this. My mother-in-law does not know that I was SAd but she does know there was a break in and I was attacked. She kept trying to convince my husband to leave me. My husband told her what she did was unforgivable and that he is going to cut her off my husband is inconsolable hes so upset he told his mother to fuck off and then told her that my attack was actually an SA and thats who our daughters biological father, it still makes me sick to say that, was she tried to apologize, but my husband told her he cant forgive her, and not to contact any of us. 


I told everyone my MIL DNA tested our daughter and we were done with her. I have 7 siblings 5 think Im in the right the other two and my BIL cant believe MIL did that but understands why because she didnt have the entire story and assumed I wasnt being truthful to my husband.
But even if I wasnt I cant imagine being a parent so concerned with my childs relationship that I would go to those lengths to meddle.

**MIL DNA tested my daughter without our consent, and proved she isnt my husbands**


**Update** 

First thank you for all your support and a big fuck off to all the creeps and assholes.

To answer the most common questions. 

Yes we are no contact with my MIL. I havent talked to her since the dinner and my husband hasnt spoken to her since a couple days after that. She knows I was raped, and attempted to apologize to my husband when he last spoke to her but he basically told her to fuck off and he couldnt forgive her. We also had a good relationship up until this point or so I thought, we hung out and did stuff together. I was just really hurtful that she told me at dinner when I asked what the envelope was, that its proof that youre the trash I always knew you were. 

Also my answers and descriptions of what took place are intentionally vague, due to the amount of attention this got, and the fact someone commented this is now on TikTok. I dont want a single person to know mine or my families true identity and try to out my daughters biology to my rapist or his family. If my daughter desires to do that in the future I want that decision to be wholly hers and not have another decision about her future to be made for her against her will. Ill suffice it to say that he is in prison for life w/o parole, and I am not the only person he did this too, he also murdered at least one other victim. There are very few articles about this trial because it was a closed trial and although none of the victims interviewed or are mentioned by name they do use initials. There is also a slew of other charges he had brought against him as well. 

People want to know why or how I couldve kept a baby knowing the possibility of the rapist being the father. And the answer is that even if I had known definitively that he was the father my decision probably wouldnt have been different. She is as much a part of me biologically speaking as she is him, and after seeing her move around I didnt desire an abortion, although it wouldve been nearly impossible for me to get one anyway where I lived.
Although she was conceived in violence she was raised in love, understanding, and acceptance. She is much more mine and my husband than my rapists. Also he did was contribute DNA to her nothing else, hes had no influence or part in her life and likely never will. I know DNA doesnt mean anything in the sense of who she is, but that doesnt diminish the devastation and anger I feel knowing he is responsible for any part of her. 

Im honestly not sure why my husband and I were so blindsided but I feel like you can convince yourself of anything given the right circumstances. Initially we did feel it was likely the rapist because of the year we went without conceiving but when I got pregnant with my son pretty soon after my daughter I know I convinced myself that not only was it a possibility it was the only likely scenario. Its also not lost on me that the decision to keep her isnt something many people agree with apparently according to this post, but I know I made the right decision because my daughter is the most amazing girl and I couldnt imagine my life without her. 

My daughter is doing well and her relationship with myself and my husband hasnt changed at all if anything her relationship with my husband is much better she makes an effort to spend more time with him and they have many shared interests. My daughter said she isnt upset I didnt tell her, shes upset she had to find out when she wasnt truly ready and she happy I was able to share such a vulnerable, horrible event with her. My son now knows the specifics and my youngest knows my daughter has a different dad but not about my rape. 

People also seem to be concerned with her genetics and how it affects her future health. She already had neonatal testing for genetic disorders, I am not a carrier of any autosomal recessive disorders, and she has had genetic testing for autosomal dominant ones and was negative. She also has had genetic testing for several different forms of cancer because of my biological family history. Anything else couldnt affect her until adulthood and they are all almost heavily influenced by lifestyle so they wouldnt be a concern until shes much older.


Im not sure what else to say so Ill just once again reiterate how thankful I am for all the support!



**Edited** for clarity and context sorry this was a rant I didnt go into a lot of specifics like I did in my initial posts here is the link. Also I didnt word it very well but we Retested my daughter and husband because they never willingly gave my MIL a sample and we didnt want to ask her how she got the DNA.

Also my husband and I have been in therapy on/off since this happened 18 years ago. And my kids have been in therapy since they were in middle school, I make them go 4X a year and they can go more often if they desire. When this initially happened I started having my daughter go weekly and now she goes every other.

**Stop messaging me asking for the story of my rape**

Im so angry I dont know what to do now that I have confirmation. She is dead to me.

Just confirmed my daughter isnt my husbands and Im devastated. A couple months ago my MIL unknowingly DNA tested our daughter cause she didnt believe she was my husbands. To make a long story short around the time of conception of my daughter I was SAd during a home invasion, this was after several years of trying for a baby. I took EC at the hospital and was depressed and stressed after. Didnt realize I was pregnant until I was 15 weeks. My husband and I decided regardless we were going to keep the baby. After she was born we decided we didnt want to find out, I felt like know absolutely she wasnt my husband would change how she was treated. My husbands family didnt know her paternity was in question, and they didnt know I was SAd. 

Well a couple months ago my MIL invited my husband and I out to dinner. She blindsides both of us by handing us envelopes with DNA results in them and basically says she always knew I was a liar and cheater and is trying to tell my husband to leave with her. My husband was devastated when he realized our daughter isnt his. Ive never seen him look more hurt. 


We had planned to tell my daughter when she was older that there was a question of her paternity and allow her to DNA testing if she wished. But instead I had to tell my 17 year old the whole story of how I was assaulted and what her grandmother did. We didnt really know how my MIL did the DNA test so we decided to get another test done, I got the confirmation this morning that my daughter and my husband have 0 biological relationship.


Im so angry and pissed we always knew this was a possibility but I didnt think so a second it could happen. She looks so much like her siblings and me. Thank god she has no resemblance to the R**ist. I immediately made her start seeing her therapist more regularly and she seems to be doing rather well despite everything. Thankfully.

(July 2022)

My partner and I have been together for 2 years. About 3 days ago I (20F) found out I was pregnant. I laughed manically and started crying, my first thought was where is the nearest clinic to get rid of it. My partner (24M) just hugged me until I calmed down. Ive been to many doctors appointments, had a scan and everything is fine. 
I dont want this. I want to be able to live my early 20s. Im 6 and a half weeks along, within this time Ive been drinking, I vape and have smoked a bit. 
I think my mental health will suffer if I go through with this pregnancy, its what my partner wants and its what my parents want. Im feeling so conflicted on what to do. 
My mom says that she doesnt agree with termination, but its my body my choice - but shes manipulating me by using scare tactics on how my mental health will suffer, how Ill regret it and how Ill ruin my fertility. 
My partner was completely supporting me when we initially found out, then he had a couple of days to think and now he really wants this baby. Hes trying to convince me that I will be a great mom, and is questioning if I will ever be ready for a child. The thing is that I know I will be a great mom, I have no doubts. Im a bit annoyed that hes questioning my want for children, yes I want them - I just dont feel like now is the time. I have 3 years left of my degree and I know that my university has plans and support systems in place to help me finish it while pregnant. I dont want to take an extra 1-2 years to finish my degree. I want to be drinking in my 21st and I want to do all the amazing things planned for New Years. I cant imagine myself pregnant right now. It feels so surreal. I think we will struggle financially - and I know Im blessed with support systems and a house already. I truly believe that if I carry this pregnancy through, I will resent this child in some way and my mental health will suffer. 
At the same time, while I dont imagine having a 5 year old in 5 years, I also wonder if it will be a huge mistake. 3 days ago I was so sure about wanting an abortion, and now with my family and my partners opinions I constantly feel like Im second guessing myself. Up until today, I felt like I was screaming at the top of my lungs about what I wanted, but just wasnt being heard. 
Last night I laid everything on the table with my partner and he was quiet for the evening and most of today. We finally sat down and he said he loves me and he wont leave me, but he respects my decision. I know he wants this, I know I dont but at the same also have no idea.

Has anyone gone through a similar situation who can offer advice on how to navigate this difficult time?

TL;DR - I want to get an abortion but my partner doesnt. And now Im confused on what to do based on other peoples opinions.

EDIT: I dont live in America. I live in New Zealand. And yes, it WAS protected sex. 
EDIT: My partner is amazing. Obviously it may not seem like it in this post. But he loves me and I know this without a doubt. Even throughout this hard time he has never stopped taking care of me while Ive been sick over the past few days. This is hard for the both of us, and as much as I know its my choice - its still a discussion to have with him. And while he may not have been everyones favourite - hes still a beautiful soul. 


UPDATE:

First off, I would like to say thank you to everyone in the comments - I felt so safe to talk about my feelings and all the advice was appreciated. 

So, its 2 months later and I am not pregnant anymore. I decided to get a medical abortion just before my 9 weeks was up. 
Making the decision was difficult - but it was only difficult because of everyone elses opinions. Its the best decision I have ever made. 

My partner and I had a long chat, over multiple days. Although he wanted to keep it, he knew I wasnt ready and supported me 100% when I booked the appointment. 
My mother sent me a novel, including photos of a foetus from 8-9 weeks, continued to tell me she loved and supported me while manipulating and berating me. I have since set communication boundaries with her. 

Leading up to getting the abortion, I was heading to my parents place for my sisters birthday (at this time they knew I was pregnant, it was still relatively fresh). I decided to go under the conditions that we dont talk about it and that absolutely NO baby things were to be bought. What happens you may ask? My mother tells me she has a few things for me for the baby and I told her she wasted her money. That caused an explosion. My mom knew where I stood with being pregnant. I didnt want it. I wasnt ready. 
My grandmother, who is more conservative and Christian than she is, said I dont agree with your decision, but I love you and will always be here for you and she was there every step of the way. 

The medical abortion wasnt that bad, bit of cramps and a lot of clotting. I ended up losing a lot of blood and had to go to the hospital where I was on the cusp of a blood transfusion. My partner was there with me and updated my dad for me - obviously he told my mother and while she was concerned, she made comments about if I had kept it I would have almost died lmao. 

Anyways, thats that. Im living life and finishing my degree - Ive made the honours list and Im so proud of myself. I dont regret it. At all. 

So again, thank you to literally everyone who supported me without even knowing me. It was a difficult time and I felt heard.

I'm sorry, I don't remember the exact term for my condition. Basically, I have the correct parts, none of them happen to work. My uterus cannot generate lining, so I can never get pregnant. The bright side is that I have never had a period in my life (I'm 32). My boyfriend's mother found this out, I don't know how, she may have heard a family member talking about it, my family knows about it, and several of his family members that I have told. When she found out and confronted me about it, she then forbade her son from marrying me because I couldn't provide him with children. Needless to say, we (my boyfriend and I) have discussed it and though a bit disappointed, are fine with it (me unable to conceive). She is now telling all her family members not to attend our future wedding because she doesn't want her son marrying someone ""defective"" who can't give him what she thinks he wants/needs. If she can come around and change her mind on this, that would be great, but as it is right now, I don't want her at the wedding, for fear of her doing or saying something to ruin the event, and he says that while he loves his mother, he is torn as to whether to invite her or not. We may just have a quick civil ceremony and only invite a few friends and relatives and tell her later, but she doesn't even want to come over when we invite her for dinner. Not sure what to do, getting tired of her calling me ""defective"" to everyone else. His father is OK with it, his aunts and uncles are understanding for the most part. We have talked about adoption in the future, but she is also against that as it is not ""his blood"" and wouldn't ""really"" be her grandchild. Just ranting here, thanks for reading.

***Relevant Comments:***

""For the commenter who said she would find something else anyway to complain about, my boyfriend's best friend came over for dinner last night and we told him that we might not have a wedding, just a simple civil service at the courthouse and told him that his (my boyfriend's) mother is the reason for our change in plans and he started trying to guess what could be the reason. It ranged from joking about my size (I'm 6'1"" and 3 inches taller than my boyfriend, and yes, the weather is fine up here and no, I don't play or even like basketball, I get those a lot) to the fact that we are currently living together, pre-marriage. When we told him the actual reason (he already knew of my condition), he was quite shocked and said he'd be there for us no matter what. That and all of your positive comments on the situation have helped me to calm down. I was so upset about this and about to walk out the door and leave him and move on with my life and I definitely didn't want to feel like that was my only option. My boyfriend is going to confront his mother about it tomorrow night (he has to do some stuff for work tonight, thus the delay) and I'll update how that all turns out. Thanks again.""

*More about OOP's condition specifically:*

""I do produce eggs and we have to use birth control, because the doctors don't want a fertilized egg starting where it shouldn't be. My best friend since I was 3 has volunteered to be a surrogate if we need one, but I don't want to take her up on that as all 3 of her births had complications so I wouldn't want to put her through more.""

**Update Comment: December 10, 2019 (Same Post)**

""I have received two text messages today before tonight's confrontation; one good, one bad - The good one was from my future father-in-law who said that he's appalled by his wife's actions and he loves me like the daughter he never had and he thinks his son is fortunate to have found me. The second was from his aunt who basically said the same thing, but added that her sister (my future mother-in-law) spoke to her about the whole thing, asked her not to attend the wedding, and then made some comment about why do I even have breasts, it's not like I'm going to use them for anything. I am so nervous for tonight, my boyfriend has asked me not to come because he thinks my being there will make it worse, so after work I'm going to stay at home, order in a pizza and curl up on the couch and watch tv while petting the cat. That last part is not a euphemism, I get a lot of comfort playing with and petting my cat.""

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/e9qy1r/fmil_won_im_no_longer_in_her_sons_life/)**: December 12, 2019. (Future Mother-in-law won, I'm no longer in her son's life)**

If you read my previous post on the matter, I can't have children, my soon to be mother in law didn't like that and did what she could to sabotage our future wedding, telling people not to attend, and calling me ""defective"". My future (no more) husband and his father were going to sit down with her Tuesday night and try to talk sense into her. Well, she won. I don't know what happened or what was said, but my boyfriend came home and we got into a big fight. Despite what we had discussed before, he now said that he wanted kids and if I couldn't provide them, the wedding was off. I basically said ""that sounds like your mother, not you"", he replied with ""I can speak for myself"" and it escalated into a bunch of shouting at each other and I quickly put together a bag and went to my parents for the evening. I called in sick from work the next day and basically stared at the ceiling. We first met when I was 9, 23 years ago, it went from being friends to more romantic, we dated through high school and went to college together, then after graduation, moved in together. I have never dated or seen anyone else, neither has he as far as I know. We waited so long to get married, because it wasn't important to us as long as we were together. That changed when my dad got a terminal disease and he expressed his wish to walk me down the aisle (I'm his only daughter) before he became too ill to walk.

I'll be giving 2 month notice at work on Monday, to give them time to find a replacement and for me to train them, then moving back to Germany. (I didn't mention that my dad is German, my mom American, they originally met when she went there for work) I was born there and lived there at first and still have friends and family there. My friend, who I had mentioned before had volunteered to be a surrogate, has said I can stay in her spare room with her and her family until I get situated on my own there.

I'm sorry, no happy ending here. The evil mother in law won and got me out of her son's life. Technically, she got me out of the country. I know I could move elsewhere in town, or even in the state, but I don't want to be alone here, there's too many memories, and I have a strong support group (friends/family) overseas so that's where I'm going. I have been picked on so many times for so many things over the years (from my height to my accent when I first moved here (gone now, I sound like any other midwestern girl) to other things), but this one hurts. I was able to handle the others by telling myself ""that's who I am, if they don't like it, that's their problem"" and I'm sure in a few years, I'll think that about this situation too, but it's too soon. Thanks for reading and your kind words of support. I'm sorry if this seems incoherent, I'm just ranting here and crying, so it's hard to keep a decent train of thought.

**Update in Comments: Same Day (Same post)**

First of all, thank you all for your support and kind comments. Two weird things happened today, One I'm extremely embarrassed about and the other I thought was just weird. First, on my lunch hour, I had to run to the grocery store to pick up some things for my mom for dinner tonight. At the grocery store, who should I happen to run into but she-who-once could have been my mother in law. I don't know what to call her, so she will be Barbie. Walking down an aisle, who should happen to appear at the other end, but Barbie. We made brief eye contact, then she immediately turned and bolted out of there. guess she had nothing to say.

The second thing was my dad came with me to the house to help me pack up my things. He's already agreed to act as my representative when the house is sold to make sure I get my fair share. While there, he stands in the corner and just glares at my ex the whole time. Then my ex has this brilliant idea to ask for ""one last time"" right in front of my father. I guess I kinda snapped. I grabbed my sweater (you can guess what part of me was right under it that I grabbed) and said ""You are never going to see these, much less touch them or play with them again or anything else"" he turned red and walked out the door, and my dad went from staring with a ""You hurt my daughter, you're lucky to be alive"" look to just bursting out in laughter once the door closed behind my ex. He then said ""I can't believe you just did that"" to which I replied ""neither can I"". for this and the rest of my story, anytime my dad and I speak to each other, I am translating it to English beforehand rather than typing it twice. I just basically felt myself up in front of my dad.

we then went home for dinner with my mom and halfway through, my mom asked ""what does Vanessa's (the girl I'm moving in with in Germany) husband do again?"" and I just lost it. a perfectly honest question, but I just let it all go in big braying sobs. After a while, my dad came over and carried me upstairs to bed like he used to do when I was 5, where I am typing this now on my laptop. I told him to tell mom that she did nothing wrong, I just needed to release and unfortunately for her, that was the time.

A lady at work already volunteered to take my cat, and my dad will store stuff like my tennis trophies and yearbooks and pictures upstairs at his house. He said that even though I may not want those photos now, perhaps in 5 years or so, I will want them, so he's gonna keep them until I'm ready to take them back.

Thanks again for all your kind words and support. I will update as warranted and answer any further questions if I can.

**Update Comment: December 13, 2019**

Well, I gave notice at work today, had some more weirdness, and am now lying in bed with my laptop. First - while at lunch today, a dozen roses came with a note that simply said ""I'm sorry"". No more, no less, but I recognized the handwriting. I asked my coworker if she would like them to give to her little daughter at home and when she said ""no, I know why you got them and I don't feel right taking them"", so in the trash they went with the note. I was going to wait until Monday to give notice, but the gossip factory had been running full time the last couple of days, so I went and told my boss that I'm leaving, but I'll stay to help train a replacement. My last day is ironically Valentine's Day. What the hell, I've got nothing else to do that day. I'll spend two weeks after that here saying bye to people, going to a few of my favorite places in town and then on February 29, my parents are going to drive me to Chicago, about 4 hours away, and I leave for Munich on March 1. My friend Vanessa lives in Munich, so I'll stay at her place a few days while I try to figure out where to go and what to do. My hometown is about a 2-1/2 hour drive away and I still have family there, so I'll decide between now and then which one to base myself in. It's a small town(maybe about 40,000, I'm not sure the exact number, but it does have a castle and a large tin soldier museum), so I don't know if I'll stay in Munich (more opportunities), go up there and try to find something, or go somewhere else in Germany, like Hamburg or berlin.

I also went to the realtor who's selling the house and had to sign a bunch or papers giving my father authority to make any decisions regarding selling. the lady said no problem, she has a lot of experience with divorcing couples, and all I thought was ""I was never even married"".

I came home and we had dinner, then my mother and I sat down and she braided my hair. It has always been our thing to do this for mommy-daughter time. We did it for the big ""It's not just for peeing"" talk, when I was first diagnosed with my condition, before the state tennis tournament, when I went away to college, basically big moments. I think this counts as one of those.

Then my ex's best friend called, said he heard what happened, said it was pretty crappy (he used stronger language. but there might be children reading this) and wanted me to come over for an evening with his family before I left. I was more friends with his wife than him, but I'll go anyway.

Again, I can't thank this community enough for their support and kind words. sorry if I branch into irrelevant topics at times, but I just type as I think, and this is all going faster than I thought. Last week, I thought I might have to start planning for a wedding, and now, I'm planning on leaving the country and starting my life over.

My mother also suggested we go to the zoo in Chicago on my last day in America. I went there when we first moved to America, she thinks it would make the perfect bookend to my whole 23-year stay in America. It seems like just yesterday when we moved into a new house and a nice boy and his mother came over, brought us a basket of cookies, and welcomed us to the neighborhood while I was out front keeping my dog away from the movers. times (and people) sure do change.

***Relevant Comments:***

*A user is rightfully disgusted and baffled at the ""one last time"" comment:*

""He was never like that or I wouldn't have fallen in love with him in the first place. It's almost as if his switch was suddenly switched from ""good"" to ""evil"" (Simpson's reference). He used to be embarrassed to even hint in front of my father that we were having sex, then he has no problem asking for one last time in front of him. My co-worker said that I should treat it as if he had died, and mourn the loss and move on, and someone else took his place.

I also don't know why after receiving supportive emails from a couple of his family members (his father and aunt), I've now heard nothing since from either of them. I didn't know his mom had that much power over them. Then again, I didn't know until recently how much power she had over my ex.""

*A commenter hypothesizes maybe he would have been written out of the will:*

""I would have thought that too, but they don't make much, enough to live on, and have no holdings I am aware of. But maybe there's a secret stash somewhere that only family knows about.""

**Update in Comments: December 19, 2019**

Update- warning; there is an act of violence in here and I'm still shaking from it. No, the main one wasn't against me depending on how you define violence. My ex came over to my parents tonight and said he wanted to talk. I have a good idea what he hoped would happen, but it definitely did not. We had a brief chat in which he said he was sorry and I told him I was moving back home to Germany soon. He started to tear up and so did I. I take responsibility for giving him the opening that was about to happen. We're both crying and we start hugging. As we're hugging, I don't notice one of his hands moving down my back to my ass until he gets a good handful of ass cheek and squeezes it. As soon as it registered in my brain what he was doing, I stepped back and let loose with my 6'1"", 155 lbs. (I'm a big girl) and 25+ years of developing a good forehand in tennis and just slapped him in the face. My hand still stings from the force of it. He staggered back and I just pointed to the door and yelled ""get out!"" though I may have added some naughty words with it. He looked shocked at me and hung his head and just walked out the door. After I heard him get in his car, start it, and drive off, I broke down in tears. My father, who had been waiting and listening outside the room the entire time (he later explained it as listening to see if I needed backup), came in the room to me crying more at this point and he started to give me a big hug. A couple minutes later while he's holding me, I thought that he might reach down and squeeze the other ass cheek. That thought sent me into hysterical laughter. We stood there holding each other while I'm alternating between laughing and crying. My mother comes downstairs and fixes us all something to drink. A few minutes later, my phone rings and according to caller ID, it's Barbie (my ex's mother and the one who started this all). Now I did not hear her side of the conversation, so anything attributed to her is what my father told me later. She basically says she's gonna call the cops on me for assaulting her son and my father says it was justifiable self-defense, my ex attacked me first (the ass squeeze) and we have cameras to show the whole thing to the cops should they show up (we don't, but she doesn't need to know that). She hung up and I haven't seen a cop since so I don't know if she was bluffing or my dad's threat scared her off.

Now I will admit that I miss the physical part of our relationship and he was my first and only at many things (first date, first kiss, first sex, etc.), but none of that outweighs the hurt he and his mother caused me. I would rather go celibate for life rather than let him touch me again. I shouldn't have let him hug me in the first place, but it was a weak moment and I know not to let him do that again. Again, thank you for reading and the kind words of support. I thought I wasn't going to update again after the last one, and yet something else happened. Hopefully, unless it is a response to something written here or a message, you won't get another update from me until I am in Germany and away from this mess. It's late and I'm going to bed now.

**Update in Comments: January 14, 2020**

Update: one mystery solved

Throughout this whole ordeal, there have been 2 mysterious things I had no answer for. 1 is why did he suddenly change his mind and 2. How did Barbie (his mother) find out? It wasn't common knowledge, nor did I tell her. I had my suspicions as to how and yesterday, they were confirmed.

Was downtown on my lunch break. Been training the new girl who's replacing me, she seems really nice and capable, I would have liked to work with her if the circumstances were different. At lunch, I ran into Steve, his friend and neighbor who he's known since he was 3 (or 6 years pre-Mia). He said he had heard about us. He said it was a shame that we had ""broken up"" and wanted to know if it had anything to do with my infertility. Now, I had not told Steve, he wasn't a close enough friend to confide in, so I asked what he knew of my ""infertility"". He then told me the whole story. This is from his point of view and I'm only relaying what he said, so may not be 100% accurate: Steve and Jack (my ex) were working on Steve's car (don't know what kind, only that it's from the 60's (I'm not a car girl, never have been. 4 wheels, an engine, and a good stereo system is all I need to know. If you ask me what kind, I would say it's blue and old, nothing more). Now, before this, we had a very informal proposal: what do you want on your toast, it looks like it's gonna rain today, should we get married. so they went to Jack's parents house, he wanted an old heirloom ring that had been in his family for centuries and wanted to make a formal proposal. He asked where it was and why he wanted it, and his mom ran crying with glee upstairs to find it. when she came back down with it, she was crying and said it would be nice to have the pitter patter of tiny feet around the house and was I currently pregnant? It seemed odd to her, I guess, that we were getting married after 16 years of dating/living together, so she thought maybe he had knocked me up and that's why the proposal after so many years. He said we already had the pitter patter of tiny feet in Babette (my cat), she said ""No, I mean a baby, silly) and he responded with ""Mia can't have babies"" and then proceeded to tell her my whole medical situation. she said something like ""this isn't going to happen"", went back upstairs, returned the ring, and slammed the door. the next day is when she forbid (forbade?) me from marrying him, started calling me ""defective"" and started this whole story.

After telling me this story, I told Steve that yes, that is one factor in our break-up, he said ""what a shame, you two made a great couple"", and Jack was probably devastated. I then said bye and went on to lunch, and when I got home later that day, I went to my room and cried into my pillow before my father came up to get me for dinner. I had always suspected that he told her somehow, and while it's not a big state-secret, it's not something I have ever felt comfortable telling people. Now that I am telling this story on this site, I have no problem saying ""my parts don't work"" to complete strangers and it's been comforting. thank you all for your support, and I leave for Germany on March 1st. I'll try to answer any questions you may have for me before then, but I guarantee nothing as I'll be kind of busy with packing and doing my ""farewell tour"" around town (saying bye to old friends, going to restaurants I like and won't be back to in years, if ever, things like that).

So that's one mystery solved, and the other could be solved if he would just answer it, rather than taking any form of communication I have with him as some sort of desire for him to get in my pants. Thanks again for your words and support, and barring something big happening between now and then, the next part of my story will come after March 1.

**Update in Comments: April 10, 2020**

Two part update. We'll start with the good first. I left America March 1 and flew to Munich. Sat next to an elderly lady who was scared to death of flying, but was going to visit her son and his family (I don't remember what he did or why he was in Germany). So for the 10 or so hours we were in the air, she held my arm in a death grip and anytime we hit an air pocket or shook around a little (it was a relatively smooth flight with just a few bumps here and there) she gripped even tighter and later I discovered I had a bruise, but fortunately her nails didn't dig in. After deplaning and going through customs, she met up with her son and his family. This happened before all the quarantine and isolation started in earnest, so not much of a problem there. Then all the fun started with the quarantine and I've spent most of my time at my friend's house, tutoring her kids in English and generally helping out around the house. I had 3 interviews scheduled before I got here, but they were all cancelled. My Uncle up in Kulmbach has volunteered to drive the 3 hours down and take me back up there, but I haven't decided yet.

The bad - apparently Jack (my ex) has been having a hard time with this. Normally, when I and the family flew back to Germany in the past, we flew out of Cedar Rapids, up to Chicago or Minneapolis then flew on to Germany. Apparently, from what a friend told me, he drove out to the Cedar Rapids airport, not knowing we had driven up to Chicago and I flew direct from there. when I didn't show up there, he went home and figured he got the time/date wrong. He sent a few letters to my house, I had my mother open and read one to me on the phone, but shortly stopped her. Even though my mother and I have been open about my sex life, there were things in that letter I didn't feel like hearing or having her hear. The letters stopped when he lost his job for non-quarantine related reasons and later wound up in jail. Nobody has been able to tell me exactly what happened, but best guess from what I've been told, one night, he got into a shouting match with his mother, which turned physical and his dad had to peel him off her until the cops showed up and arrested him, so I guess things got pretty bad so that one of the neighbors called the cops. I never would have expected this from him with anybody, much less his mom. If only he could have fought this hard for me way back when, things might be different.

So, as of this update, I'm sitting around with not much to do, but at least I'm not in jail. Sorry for any errors, I loaned my laptop to my friend's son and it hasn't worked properly since, though he claims he did nothing bad to it. He's a good kid, so I believe him that it was probably just an accident. Hope everyone is staying safe and doing as well as can be during this time. auf wiedersehen. -Mia

***Comment April 13, 2020:***

Thank you for your kind comments. the older lady on the plane was funny, when she sat down, she said ""shprecken zee english?"" (Intentionally misspelled to demonstrate how bad it was.) I hope things are well with her and she's able to get back to America eventually.

There is a restaurant in Munich I was looking forward to going to, but that's been put off for a while I guess.

I have no idea what his intention in going to the airport was. If he thought there might be a ""talk her out of going"" moment, or just to simply say goodbye. I asked my mother to save up all the letters and mail them to me in a few months just out of curiosity. Maybe I'll read them on my birthday (July 12) - yet another thing to think about and ponder for a while.

Thanks again for your kind words and stay safe out there.""

***Comment April 14, 2020:***

Thank you and I saw no problem with your english. I had been thinking of calling him while I was here, but his recent troubles have made me rethink it. I have no idea how you call someone currently in jail. If I am motivated enough, I might try it. He only mailed the letters to my parents' house in Iowa because he has no clue, other than Germany, where I am right now. I am hoping that when this virus thing blows over, I will return to America for a visit in 2 years and maybe I will feel comfortable by then to see him in person.

It's like he had a complete personality change and that's what mystifies me the most. He went from quiet and reserved to some sort of deviant maniac and now I wonder when at some time in our marriage (if it had gone through), he would have laid his hands on me, like he did with his mother.

To answer a previous question, I will be 33 in July and he will also be 33 in October.

I have been to a lot of European countries, but Spain has not been one of them. Maybe once I get established here, it will be easier for me to jet over and check it out.

Thank you again for your kind words. Stay safe during this current crisis.

[Post 1](https://www.rareddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/g49jsj/update_from_germany_i_talked_to_him/) **April 19 2020**

I actually spoke to him yesterday on the phone. when last I updated, he had been arrested and thrown in jail for assaulting his mother. I don't know if he's out on bail, or there were no charges, or what, but he has spent the last few days sittting in my parent's front yard, doing nothing but sitting. My dad said he was going to go out there and kick his ass, but my mom, who's definitely the cooler headed of the two, went out there and calmly told him I was gone and he should pick up and start his life over too. She called me and told me this, so I decided to call him, which I did last night. He answered and sounded kind of relieved it was me, but also sad. J=Jack (my ex), M=me (or Mia, either one works). This is the conversation to the best of my memory:

J: Hello

M: Hello, I understand you're out in my parent's front yard. Well, I'm not there, so please leave them alone.

J: I was hoping that the rumors I heard weren't true, that you were still here and we could talk.

M: I tried talking before and you just took it as a chance to grab my ass and act as if sex could solve this whole thing.

J: I'm sorry, I've never broken up before, so I'm not sure how to go about it.

M: I've never broken up before either, but I think I've handled it better. I just gotta know - why?

J: I have to do what my mother says, and she wasn't happy when she found out you couldn't have children.

M: You're 32, I don't think you have to do what your mother says anymore.

J: you just don't understand.

M: I do understand. We had discussed the problem before and had come up with solutions which apparently aren't satisfactory to her, so you threw our relationship away. Did it mean that little to you?

J: You didn't have to go away. When are you coming back?

M: Not for a couple of years. Once this whole pandemic thing is over, I can hopefully find a job and my own place to stay.

J: Come back, please.

M: I'm sorry, but you made your choice. Barbie (his mother) or me. I hope the two of you are quite happy together.

throughout all of this, he is crying, and I'm doing my best not to.

J: Please come back, we can get married and adopt or whatever. I'm sorry, we can find a way to work this out.

M: I told you there were always alternatives, but you threw those away along with me. Plus, Barbie's going around calling me defective and she won't accept us adopting, how does that change?

J: You're not defective. I'm sorry, but I can't control what she thinks.

M: No, but you support what she thinks. You've known this about me since we were 16, suddenly it's an issue.

J: I don't like her calling you defective. In case you hadn't heard, I just spent time in jail for defending you.

M: Maybe if you had done that when this all started, I'd still be there.

I think that broke him, because he kept quietly whispering ""sorry"" over and over and then hung up. I just laid on the bed and quietly cried until viktoria (my friend's oldest child) knocked quietly and told me it was time for dinner.

sorry for the formatting, still trying to get used to how reddit works. Also sorry if I came across as a bitch in this, but when someone throws away a relationship that goes back to childhood, I can be a bit upset. Hope everyone is staying safe through this whole pandemic thing and hopefully, when it's all over, I can get on with my life here in Germany

Warning: there is talk of suicide in here, not me, just someone else in the story hinting at it

so, I moved out of my friend vanessa's this weekend. Her family was incredibly nice in taking me in, but when we first planned this, it was pre-virus, and I thought I'd have my own place and a job and everything. My uncle said he would drive down and pick me up and I felt better taking his offer than continuing down there. So, he came down Saturday, spent the night with some friends of his, and we drove back up to Kulmbach on Sunday, where I am currently staying with him and his wife and typing this out before bed.

It's weird being here, given I was born here and lived my first 9 years here, but even when I've been here on vacation in the past, it never felt as strange just being here. I don't know if it's the feeling of the town being deserted, or my current personal situation, it just doesn't feel right. Anyway, that's enough of miscellaneous rambling, I'm just trying to avoid typing the real part of this story if you couldn't tell.

Friday night, Jack (my ex) called me. I still have the same phone and the same account back in Iowa, so when it rang with his distinct ring tone, it caught me by surprise. I picked it up and said, ""Whaddya want?"", which I know was a bit rude and I apologized to him about it as soon as he said, ""I just wanted to see how you were doing and say hi"". So, we proceeded to have a pleasant conversation, when I could hear screeching and a ""is that her?"" followed by him saying ""I'm talking, leave me alone"" when she (Barbie, his mother who started all this) got on and said, ""Leave my son alone, haven't you done enough damage?"" To which I responded by simply hanging up. She must have gotten his phone and tried calling me a few more times, none of which I answered, but when I checked voice mails later, she was going off on how I ""ruined his life"", how he had lost his job (which we knew was going to happen anyway last year when the owner of his company announced his retirement and that he was selling off the assets, but he gave one year notice and even helped some employees find work elsewhere, he had lost his house (we sold our house after our breakup), he had been caught ""drinking in public"" (I guess he bought a few bottles, went down near the lake and drank in the park and got busted by the police for it, heard that from another friend earlier, and how he had attacked her (mentioned before, but I secretly hoped he would have decked her good before his dad intervened). She even got to use her favorite word, ""defective"", saying that if she had known 16 years ago that I was defective, she would have gotten her son a nice, normal girl to be with. She also mentioned that Jack had talked about suicide recently, saying there's no point in going on. i tried calling back, but every time, she picked up the phone and resumed her screaming, so I gave up trying and just wrote him a letter, which I sent to my parents for them to deliver to his house, figuring barbie would just see it was from me and intercept it if I sent it to him directly. I told him that I still loved him and wanted him to do well in life and move on, but that it was over between us.

So, here I am 5000 miles away, civilization shut down, living with my aunt and uncle and just waiting for when I can put my life back together.

I would be throwing up, crying, unable to move and at one point I even passed out and my little brother found me. The doctor wanted to schedule an ultrasound because she was very concerned. 

My mom still blamed period cramps and didn't want to take me to any other appointments so she made up a fake medical condition that she said the doctor called and told her about after we left. I tried to look up the condition and I found that it doesn't even exist but I was a kid so there was nothing I could do. She told everyone I was having bad period cramps and being dramatic for 5 YEARS. 

I'm an adult now and I still have the same issue so I scheduled my own appointment and got diagnosed. The doctor says that the chance of me having a baby is very low since I waited so long to do anything about the issue but there are treatments/surgeries I could go through that may slightly increase the chances. (Obviously NOT doing the treatments or surgeries) 

My mother has demanded that I one day have kids since I was about 5. She even used to pick out men she thought would make good/pretty children and try to push me into dating them when I was a teen (yes, MEN not boys/teens). She seems to think that being a mother is the only thing I was ever meant to do and telling her that I don't want kids always resulted in a huge argument. I've always known that I didn't want them. I didn't even like kids when I was a kid. 

I can't even find the words to describe the way I felt when I told her that I could no longer have children because this condition wasn't treated earlier and that it's the whole reason I was in so much pain as kid when I begged her to find someone who could help me. The look on her face when she realized that she ruined her own dream of me having children was AMAZING. The moment she realized that she could have prevented this if she had been a decent mother was even better. 

I'm not sure if I believe in Karma or God but if they're real then they've got the best sense of humor and their justice was perfection here. 

I'm still going to get my tubes tied since the doctor said there was a LOW chance but not NO chance but I'm not telling my mother that. 

TLDR: my mother, who's only dream for me is to have kids, called me dramatic when I asked her to find someone who could help me with extreme pain in my abdomen as a child. I scheduled my own appointment as an adult, was diagnosed and got the pleasure of telling her that the doctor said that because I waited so long to seek treatment I can't have children.

*EDIT: Some people are asking what I said and how my mom reacted. I responded to one comment but I couldn't find the other ones so I'm going to put it here. 

I didn't straight out blame her for it. I just said what the doctor told me and told her that I couldn't do fertility treatments or fix it so I wouldn't be able to have kids. She knew it was her fault on her own for obvious reasons. She wasn't hurt or apologetic about it which is fine since I didn't expect her to be. She was just angry and annoyed that I couldn't have kids. She didn't even ask if I was okay or how I felt about everything. The fact that one of her kids is literally unable to do exactly what she wants them to and she can't victimize herself or throw a fit about it is what really bothers her. I did bring up the medical condition she made up though and she just said ""well that's what the doctor told me."" So she's obviously not sorry about that either lol","childfree",7887,7887,0,1,26,1,0,328

[**WIBTA by not telling a guy I've been dating for a month that I'm having artificial insemination to be a single mother?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/h7k8dj/wibta_by_not_telling_a_guy_ive_been_dating_for_a/) - 12 June 2020

Prior to lockdown, I'd decided to be a single mother by choice. The journey to accepting this has taken 2 years, and included counselling and a very thorough plan to ensure I could do this alone.  I was happy with my decision, and I was at a good place in life where i realised my desire to be a mother was stronger than looking for partner, which may or may not happen - and with my fertility declining, I chose to go down this path as a solo woman.

Right before I was due to have artificial insemination with donor sperm, the pandemic hit, and treatments were cancelled. There was no timeline for when things may reopen. For a few days I was devastated as I was so mentally prepared for this, and then I picked myself up and decided to park my plan - after all I didn't have a choice. I downloaded a dating app out of curiosity and figured that I could still chat to guys and see what happened, without any expectation really.  
I've been talking with a guy (let's call him G) and it's only been a month, so very early stage. However, we've met up twice (with a 3rd meeting planned), spoken many times on the phone, and I get a really good feeling from him. For the first time in years, quite frankly, I feel emotionally connected with a man, and it feels completely natural and promising.   
During this time, my clinic called me to say they have had approval to open, and do i wish to go ahead this month with my treatment. I want to be a mother more than ever, so I said yes, and I'm now on medication with my appointment set for next week.  
While there's no guarantee i'll get pregnant on the first go, I have a conflict in my mind about informing G of my plan.  On the one hand it's at such an early stage of our romance without yet being anything committed that I feel like I'm bringing something up prematurely.  On the other hand, I wonder what may happen as time goes on - am I just delaying the inevitable? Is it deceptive of me not to inform him of something so fundamental in my life? A friend told me that I'd sabotage a potential relationship with him by telling him of this plan right now, and that a man who is really into me will accept me even if I'm pregnant, and that more time is needed for him to really get to know me.  But in my mind I'm wondering if it will piss him off by suddenly saying 'hey I'm pregnant, btw'.  
We've spoken loosely about wanting kids in the future, so I know he'd like a family, but it was a brief, passing comment. I'm also not willing to wait to get into a long term relationship - and we are far too early on to be thinking about a family together.  
WIBTA by keeping quiet about the plan for now?

Verdict: YTA

&amp;nbsp;

[**UPDATE: A month ago I was told I WBTA for not telling a date about my plans to be a single mother, so I told him**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/i4sa5r/update_a_month_ago_i_was_told_i_wbta_for_not/) - 6 August 2020 

A month ago I asked if I WBTA for not telling a guy I had only started dating that I had plans to become a single mother. I was scared I'd lose him but also felt I would be deceiving him by not telling him, thus making the investment in our relationship unfair. The comments were pretty much unanimous in that I'm an asshole, and I needed to tell him, and this validated my decision to go forth and be honest, as nervous as I was.

I explained my situation about taking 2 yrs to come to this decision, how my fertility clinic had shut due to Covid which was why I had gone back onto dating apps. I explained how my clinic had reopened after meeting him, and how important it was to me to continue in my journey to become a mother. I knew this was 'baggage' he hadn't expected and that there was every chance he would step away from the situation. Well, he didn't.

We're now in a committed relationship and he's been supporting me in my journey. I've had 2 unsuccessful artificial inseminations with donor sperm (my original plan), and we've spoken about having a child together. As early on as it may seem, he told me my honesty made him consider his own future and how he really wants a family some day, and how he has admiration for me being honest about my situation and how he wants to help my fulfil my desires to be a mother, whether with him or with donor sperm - either way he wants to be a part of my life.

I wanted to provide this update as a positive outcome has come out of being labelled an asshole and it pushed me to do the right thing, which has in turn meant I have the most understanding and accepting bf. Had I kept this info from him it would have played on my conscience, as well as most likely have caused him to not trust me. So thank you : )  

**EDIT -**

Gosh, I didn't think this post would blow up in this way. Thanks for the lovely words of support, and also those of you taking the time to provide food for thought of co-parenting and step-parenting. This is new territory for me, and I don't know anyone else in my day to day life who has been in this situation, so it's so valuable for me to hear your views and gain new perspectives. Thank you, kind Reddit community.

[**UPDATE (2): I was told I WBTA for not telling a date about my plans to be a single mother, so I told him**](https://www.reddit.com/user/GirlWithInternet/comments/pr66vy/update_2_i_was_told_i_wbta_for_not_telling_a_date/) - 19 September 2021

I tried posting the below to AITA as I'd had a number of requests for an update, but it turns out you can't post more than 1 update, so I'm posting this to my profile instead for anyone who may be interested. Thanks for reading and for being interested.

I wanted to put out an update after receiving a number of requests and good wishes.

It's been 14 months since the last post. I commenced fertility treatment back in June 2020 just after my 3rd date with G, having told him of my plans. After 3 failed rounds of IUI (insemination), the last of which ended in an early miscarriage, I switched to IVF, and fell pregnant the first round in October 2020. I was with G when the clinic called to confirm my pregnancy, and he was genuinely thrilled for me.

Me and G continued to date during this time. Last summer is full of lovely memories of park picnics in the sun, long scenic walks, cooking dinners together and generally wholesome hanging out.

My country fell into a strict lockdown in Dec 2020 at 3 months pregnant. We continued our relationship long distance, as he'd moved from my city back home temporarily to look after his mother. We found ways to keep things alive - sending each other gifts for example. G moved back to the city earlier this year, and throughout the final stages of my pregnancy we continued to see each other.

2 months ago I gave birth to a boy - B. I was only allowed one consistent guest which was my birth partner - my mother. I kept G up to date and sent videos/had calls from the hospital. He couldn't be with me physically, but he'd packed a whole bunch of useful things for my hospital bag, and ensured things were as comfortable for me as possible. 

G describes my son as an extension of me. Despite not being the biological father, he wants to play a fatherly role, which warms my heart. I've been learning a lot about what I need to do to ensure B can thrive without a biological father, and have great male role models around him, like G.

It hasn't all been plain sailing though. I moved in with my mother when I commenced fertility treatment (that was always the plan to help support me - not financially but rather to help look after B) and she was cynical of me dating someone who wasn't the biological father. She found the whole thing unconventional (which it is!) and unrealistic. A week ago they met for the first time, and she liked him and is slowly accepting him.

B is my world and my priority. Me and G are still on a learning curve to figure things out, but what we're sure about is that we want to build a life together.

Thank you to you all who took the time to offer constructive and encouraging advice. I sometimes wonder if I'd be with G had I not told him the truth about my fertility plans, and r/AmItheAsshole made that decision very clear for me, so thank you.

This all began when you and another woman went into a sex toy store with my husband. A few months before that, I took my husband to a sex toy store. He was absolutely mortified to be there with me. He literally asked me if we could just go get ice cream instead.


The first time he picked you up from your house for dinner, I had fucked him that morning.


When he complained to you that his cold boring wife hadn't touched him in a month, I FUCKED HIM FOUR TIMES THAT WEEK. 


You asked him why he didn't want to open his relationship, that way he could get his needs met elsewhere. He told you it's because I would never agree to it. FUCKING LOOK AT ME. If we had an open marriage, there would be a line of guys around the fucking block trying to hit this. THAT'S WHY.


You asked him if I was kinky and he told you I wasn't. Ignoring the fact that I came into the relationship with all the whips, chains, and handcuffs. WAP is a biography of my life. He asked me to put the toys away, and I was more than willing since the sex was good enough that I didn't need the extra spice.


March 15th... When he texted you on March 15th, it's true, it had been a couple of weeks since I was able to be intimate with him. The IVF hormones had left me so bloated and uncomfortable I was barely able to move. While I was in surgery getting my eggs removed to have his fucking child, he was sitting in the waiting room telling you how much he missed the taste of you.


And in July, when I had a miscarriage, instead of mourning with me, he was waiting for a call from you.


We were planning on buying a bigger car to fit all the incoming baby stuff. He told you the bigger car was that so you two would have more room to fuck.


I just want you to know, everything that man said was a lie. I'm not mean, I'm not cold. I am a firecracker in the bedroom and I still fit into my wedding dress despite the rollercoaster of hormones and fertility medications. But he still never talked to me the way he talked to you.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yeh83x/wibta_for_not_attending_my_best_friends_wedding/)**: (October 26, 2022)**

My (F27) best friend (F27) is getting married in February. She has been planning her wedding for 2 years and I have been actively helping her the entire time as her maid of honor. I am extremely excited for her to get married, but she is slightly controlling. She's the kind of girl that has to have everything perfect or it's completely ruined. But her wedding, her rules.

Well, I found out I was pregnant at the beginning of October and am due toward the end of June. This is my first baby and I have struggled heavily with fertility issues so this is a literal miracle baby. My husband and I had literally just given up hope in trying for a little while this past summer. I will be in my second trimester during the time of her wedding. Well, I told my best friend last week and she seemed... upset. She wasn't too happy that I was pregnant and her first question is if I would fit in my bridesmaid dress. The dress is extremely flowy and I told her that I should be just fine, and if not I'll cover the cost of any alternations/buying another dress (I bought my dress in the first place anyways). Like literally her first question, not even congratulations.

I tried to shrug it off and just assumed she was stressed. Her bachelorette party is next month (I've been exclusively planning it) so I just reached out with the final details to her to confirm everything. During the phone call she tried to make me feel bad that I wouldn't be drinking with the rest of them and that it wouldn't be the ""bach party of her dreams"" and I told her it would still be fun. That upset me even more, but I just tried to shrug it off once again.

Today she called and told me she had a ""hard decision"" to make but she's been thinking about it and while she would like to keep me MOH she doesn't want me in her pictures. She said that my bump would be too distracting, she didn't want her pictures to turn into a ""maternity photoshoot"" and that she just didn't feel comfortable with it. However, she still wanted me to pay for the bachelorette party, help her plan the wedding, and wanted me to do almost everything MOH except be in pictures and she was debating if she still wanted me to give a speech. She then sent me a bunch of bag-like dresses to choose from as my new dress since I won't need my MOH dress.

We have been best friends since we were 10. I would have never in my wildest dreams expected her to act this way. WIBTA for dropping out of her wedding? I really don't feel like paying for, and being supportive of, a person who treats me like a disposable mooch after years of fertility issues. But I also feel like I may be overreacting as some of my friends said that I would look odd in the pictures. Thoughts?

**Relevant Comments: (same post)**

*Regarding the absurdity of turning it into a ""maternity shoot:""*

""That was the absolute most hurtful comment to me. Her photographer is my friend (I'm the one who introduced them!) and I think she believes since the photographer knows me that they'll focus on me more than her. I cannot explain how I'm close enough to this photographer that if I wanted pictures she would take them for me on a random Tuesday night if I wanted. My friend is not going to risk her literal career over my pregnancy and I'm not going to ruin her photographs because I'll have a small little baby bump.

ALSO ALSO ALSO at my wedding, I DID have a photo shoot of just her and me replicating photos of our childhood (we are both only children so I thought it would be a sweet almost sister-like thing). She suggested it and I loved the idea so I paid extra to set up two separate scenarios of us to commemorate the moment. I never felt like it took away from my day and I love those pictures, it took at most 15 minutes and my husband was our hype man in the background. I never even suggested or even planned on suggesting we get pictures of me pregnant or just my belly or whatever she was thinking. I don't know who she thinks I'm randomly going to become pregnant but it hurts my feelings so deeply.""

*Regarding the drinking comment early on:*

""In retrospect, I should have been more off-put about the drinking comment. Idk I just thought to myself that she was upset because we were known for our party days and I was going to allow her to mourn that, but to shame me for not drinking after trying for years for a baby was... weird. Like what response was I supposed to give? Sure because you're upset I will now drink! Too bad for my poor miracle baby!

Also, I'm still incredibly fun not drinking. She knows I can have a good time either way. Sorry, just thinking out loud in the comments haha.""

*When gently told to just back out:*

""I am mostly so scared to lose our friendship. I have no siblings and she has been like a sister to me for nearly 18 years. I keep trying to justify her behavior or find a way out of this without wrecking the friendship and I don't know what to do.""

*About the other friends:*

""I'll be honest, a lot of them are her college friends/co-workers that I have nicknamed her ""yes men"" and she knows I do. They weirdly worship her and will hang on to her every word. She runs a really successful business so I know WHY they do, but it's still so weird to me lol. There's one other girl from HS on there that we are both friends with who is on my side 100% (aka why should I not be MOH because I might have a small baby bump) and I've been talking to about how to go about this, but I don't want to make her give up such a long-running friendship either so I told her not to worry and that I would work it out. She can make whatever decision she wants, but I don't want her to feel forced to give up a friendship over an argument that doesn't have to do with her.""

*Commenter tells her to read this and then think of what she would say if this were a friend and not herself:*

""Right before I read this comment my husband asked me to do this hahahahaha (he is very much supportive of a full-on cut-off from her but respects my decision). It uh... definitely hurt and opened my eyes. I think I let things slide too easily for me but I know how I absolutely wouldn't let this happen if this was my husband and child situation. And technically my child IS in this situation. I've taken this more as an offense to me but I'm starting to realize how it's a hit to my baby.""

*More about the bride: (This was technically posted after the next update but I thought it fit here)*

**""**To be honest, this is kind of how her behavior is. She grew up extremely spoiled and wealthy (and I did not) so I think some of our friendship has been me justifying her actions because her parents just ""never said no."" When we went off to college our freshman year, she literally moved off campus for half a semester because her roommate in her dorm made a joke about her major. I remember at the time thinking ""that's extreme but that's just my bff!"" and laughing, but that is very much her personality. When she is great and everything is going perfectly, she is fantastic and the best person in the entire world. When things get a little dicey, she tends to be a little less great bordering on mean. However, her actions have never been toward me. I should have probably known that one day it would get there but since we had 17 years of basically argument-free friendship, I just thought she would always be the person that sticks up for me and I would always be the person that evens her out/calms her down.""

**First Update in** [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yeh83x/wibta_for_not_attending_my_best_friends_wedding/ityhkae/?context=3)**: (October 26, 2022)**

""I'm going to bed now but I've collected my thoughts enough to know that I'm going to call her tomorrow and have a very blunt conversation, hopefully I can get her in person. I'm either in her pictures as MOH with the dress I have or I'm not in her wedding/attending at all. I'll also be speaking about how her actions have made me feel and how her lack of excitement about my pregnancy (despite me holding 110% enthusiasm for 2 years for her wedding because I am excited for her, but also because I know it makes me feel good to have people excited for her) has deeply wounded me. I know it's going to be a friendship-altering conversation and I am not excited to have it, but I will let you know what ends up happening. Thank you all for the support and kind words. I normally am a very anti-confrontation/water off a duck's back kinda person, but all these comments telling me I deserve better have been very encouraging.""

**Second Update: (Same post, October 27 2022)**

I want to first say a big thank you to all the wonderful comments of congratulations and support. I often try to be very level-headed about things, sometimes to the detriment of myself, and also still wanted to be a part of the day since she is my best friend and we have grown together for so long. I am someone who really values integrity and I felt like if I dropped out, I would be betraying a core value of mine. And many many many people reached out to me for an update, so here it is:

I sat down with her and had a very long and blunt talk. I even brought out the post to show her that I am not crazy about some of the points I made. I told her about how deeply my feelings were hurt by her words and actions. I told her I couldn't understand why I couldn't be a full MOH and be included in pictures. If I were to be fully honest, she almost convinced me that the whole idea of just keeping me as MOH but with no pictures was for my benefit. She told me it was to take the ""stress"" off of me for the day and to make sure I didn't feel uncomfortable with my ""new weight"" but I knew it wasn't true. I knew she just didn't want me to be in her wedding party with a baby bump but wanted my money and planning expertise (I've withheld this information but I am a wedding planner with many connections, however, I wouldn't cut any of them off due to a falling out. I am not planning her wedding as I felt it would be too much for me because I would want it to be to a level of perfection I couldn't achieve, but I did hook her up with another planner friend who is incredible but she has utilized me for free a lot). I think I realized all too clearly in almost an instant that the second she got engaged that our friendship became a business-partnership to her, whereas it never changed for me. For the past two years, what I thought were friendship-bonding experiences for me I realized were merely free expenses for her.

In the end, I decided to step out of the wedding as MOH. I will be sending all the information I have to our joint friend who is in the wedding party and will still be paying for that friend's portion of the bach party instead of the whole thing, as I know it will put that friend out of money which I feel awful about. I have been uninvited to the wedding as a whole, which was not unexpected. My friend was very angry and upset with the conversation and said some deeply hurtful things that will take me a long time to recover from. To say I am devastated is an understatement, as I expected this woman to be the godmother of my child. But I feel extremely relieved to have discovered this before the birth of my child. Now my baby's life will be filled with people who love them unconditionally. and the same goes for me.

Once again, thank you all. I appreciate your assurances and help more than you will ever know!

**Relevant** [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yeh83x/wibta_for_not_attending_my_best_friends_wedding/iu38ahb/?context=3) **regarding the update: (October 28, same post)**

*Why OOP is paying for the one friend:* 

""I promise I am only paying for my one friend who is not the bride! The price is *significantly* lower, and if my friend (who is debating on even staying in the wedding party) goes the trip would be a huge unexpected cost to her that I can't have that weighing on my heart. She is in a very overworked and undervalued profession that rarely gets a break, so I'm taking it as a way to give her a well-deserved paid vacation since I know I planned a kick-ass bachelorette party. If she doesn't go, I think we're going to plan our own girl's trip at an all-inclusive resort for a little TLC since she already has the days off! Either way, it's a win for her! I personally will be using the week either way to get a massage and maybe a small get-away with my husband. We're working out the details!""

**OOP added further information after her story was** [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/bridezillas/comments/yfh0es/wibta_for_not_attending_my_best_friends_wedding/iu7zh4v/?context=3) **in** r/bridezillas **(October 29, 2022)**

Hi! OP from the post here. After reading all the comments on my post about how my friend was such a ""bridezilla"" I was advised to check out this sub and saw my post crossposted here haha.

I do know that people use reddit a LOT for creative writing (I've actually never taken to a reddit sub for moral questions like this but I honestly felt so gaslight by the bride and her ""yes men"" bridesmaids that my request to be in pictures would ruin her whole wedding that I felt actually crazy and didn't know where else to go because it was embarrassing to ask my other friends that knew us) but I can tell you that this is a very true story of a devastating moment in my life. I think I obviously wrote the post in a very black-and-white manner with super basic details, but there is so much nuance to relationships that can't be put into 3k words. I just told the story from my perspective, which in the moment I wrote it was filled with hurt.

But the reason I'm writing this comment is not to tell you to believe me (little creepy for people on the internet to do and also why should you care about my life either way?) but it is to explain me paying for the entire bach party. I grew up extremely poor and got married young (20, we had dated since 15) because my husband and I were excited to start our lives together and didn't really care about the ""perfect"" wedding at all. To me, weddings are all about feeling and people. We couldn't afford much of anything and I planned my entire wedding and only spent the largest bit of money on the photographer. We literally got married in my bff's family's backyard (it's huge and gorgeous) and my mom's family was kind enough to make all the food and I did all my flowers, DIY decor, etc.  
Anyway, this is my long-winded way of saying that I did not even plan or THINK about a party for myself as I was young and couldn't afford it. I had 3 bridesmaids that were in college and we were also all incredibly poor and I didn't want to make them spend anymore money than the dresses for the wedding. My now ex-BFF surprised me with a fully-paid trip for me and all of my bridesmaids to what was honestly my perfect bachelorette party. Thinking about it now still brings me tears and I had no idea she was going to do it. Obviously, her family paid for it, she grew up very wealthy, but the gesture still touches me so deeply. I promised her I would do the same when she got married. I loved planning my own wedding so much I actually changed my major in college to event planning &amp; management and now plan weddings for a career and I love it! And I do pretty well! I could luckily absolutely afford to pay for the entire trip for my bff's bach party like I promised her I would (minus everyone's travel, I'm not paying for 6 plane tickets but I'll absolutely pay for a 3 day stay in a Vrbo easy). It was my gift to her, as she gifted me years ago.

Sorry for the long winded post. I saw a lot of assumptions on the OG post but it was overwhelming to have so many responses to every single comment I posted, as I thought that my post wouldn't get more than like 10 views and maybe a helpful comment. It felt much less daunting to answer it on this forum. Hope this clarifies that for you!

*Another reply*

This happened a few days ago so honestly there has not been much of an update other than what I gave on the post. I told her I wouldn't be her MOH unless I was in pics, she kicked me out of her wedding, and we haven't spoken. To me, our friendship is over and I don't know if there is anything that could be done to restore it. So I don't know if you would call it graceful, but I can confidentially say I am no longer her friend.","BestofRedditorUpdates",6563,6563,0,0.98,0,0,2,343

My daughter is 17 and her bf is 17 as well. They are both in high school. She came to me and told me that her bf and her are going to be trying for me a baby. 

Her reasonings: 

""She said that every girl in her high school are pregnant and she doesnt want to wait when shes old and in her 30s to wait to get pregnant. She says shes in her prime with fertility and it dies out in her 30s and she simply doesnt want to wait when she is old. She says she wants to be young when her kids graduate high school and not going through menopause 

"" government money and both of her and her bfs part times jobs will help support the baby and the bfs family is active on helping watching the baby when they are at work 

""she says she got all her information already on this topic and follows a lot of Tik tok influencers that are also teens having babies and watches these day to day teens raising baby videos 

""both of them dont plan to go to college. They said they want to stop their education after high school graduation because they said college is a scam 

Please help us. I dont know how to do. We are immigrant parents from Asia and I know this is a normal thing to do in western societies but this is not our culture, this behavior is zero tolerated for us. We regret moving to western country and raising our kids here. She has been badly influenced by social media and the other kids at her school 

We have tried talking to her, we have tried telling her that this is wrong. She is not listening. We dont know what to do.

Update: my daughter(17) wants to have a baby with bf

I got a lot of feedback from my post and I was asked by many to provide an update. 

Our daughter is pregnant, she found out before we found out. We went through her phone and found out she went through with it. She refuses for an abortion, she said shes not going to commit a legal murder. 

We disowned our daughter. She isnt our daughter anymore. No one in our intermediate and extended family talks to her anymore. We took away everything we gave her and she only has basic necessities since she is still our responsibility and shes in high school. We are kicking her out on her 18th birthday next year. 

Majority of the comments from the post were advising me to cut ties with my daughter since she is acting like she is an adult then treat her like one. Im not going to be supporting and providing for her mistake child out of wedlock.

We are distraught. This brings great shame to our community. My family and I are deeply devastated. We have 3 other intelligent children that are amazing children so we dont know how our daughter ended up being this terrible. 

I know most of you were upset of my comments about western society. I didnt mean to offend anyone. I was just making my own cultural observations. When I immigrated to the USA, India was a third world country at the time and we moved to the US hoping for a better future and easier life for our children, we wanted to give them the life we never got to have. This type of thing does not happen in India; this is simply not in our culture. When we moved to the US there are obvious culture shocks. Teen pregnancy or having children young while you are unwed is socially accepted and glorified in the US. Someone else in the comments made a good point on how common it is in the US for this behavior that you all have a show dedicated to teen pregnancies I believe its called 16 and pregnant. This is simply more common than in other places like in Asia. Just a fact. Didnt mean to make anyone cry.

Or just skip to the end where I put a one sentence summary.

Oh, and if you think I'm some full of shit doomer, I'd recommend you browse my profile and note just how many of those DD's (like my recent post on real estate) are coming true fully fucking accurate.

**TL;DR: There's not enough food for everyone, people gonna get fucked like Marilyn Monroe at a Kennedy family reunion.**

Ok, so at this point everyone has noticed that the cost of food and gas is going up. This post is about food. As for gas... something's going on there, prices of gasoline and diesel have become completely disconnected from the cost of oil, reminds me a lot of what happened to California's electricity when Enron was fucking with supply, I haven't looked into the gasoline market at all, but the price of a barrel of oil vs. a gallon of gasoline is more whack than Flava Flav at an all night buffet of crack.

So, back to food. In order to invest correctly we need to figure out just how bad things are going to get, and to do that we need to answer a couple of questions.

1. How much is supply getting restricted?
2. How much is that going to affect the price of food?

Let's start with the easier one, how much of a shortfall in food production are we looking at? Let's begin with the war in Ukraine. According to the USDA, in 2021 Ukraine produced 41,900,000 Metric Tons (MT) of Corn, 33,000,000 MT of Wheat, 31,643,00 MT of oilseeds, and 9,900,000 MT of Barley. In global export terms they ranked between #1 and #5 in each of those categories. Current USDA projections as of May 2022 have 19,500,000 MT of Corn, 21,500,000 of Wheat, 22,420,000 MT of oilseeds, and 6,000,000 MT of Barley. However, these projection numbers are constantly being revised down.

Ukraine's wheat crop is 97% winter wheat, and the harvesting of it is supposed to begin in July. The fields are also located in the South and East of the country, around cities like Mariupul, Donetsk, Luhansk and Kherson. If those sound familiar, it's for a reason, they're where all the fighting is. Equally important is the fact that Russia is blockading the Black Sea, so it's not just Ukraine's exports being reduced, it's other countries like Serbia as well. Currently there are around 25,000,000 MT of various agricultural goods locked up in Ukrainian ports getting ready to start rotting in warehouses and silos.

&amp;#x200B;

[It's a blockade.](https://preview.redd.it/t155o0bwrc591.jpg?width=290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=820560a8bdf123b8cf381be848bb9366dc9c7c6f)

Combining the blockade with the severe damage to the roads and bridges (remember the story about the heroic Ukrainian who blew that one key bridge? Nobodies rebuilt any of those for civilian use yet) and silos needed to harvest, transport, and store grain and other agricultural products, plus the prime areas of farmland and distribution being contested or under Russian control, and the harvest getting ready to not start at all in two weeks, I'm gonna say that Ukraine's exports this year will probably be close to zero. Even the optimistic projections of the USDA right now show enough lost production to completely offset the number of MT that Ukraine normally exports. Ukraine might honestly go from a top 3 worldwide food exporter last year to a net importer this year if things get bad enough.

Well, what about places that aren't Ukraine you may be asking? Now lets get into another issue facing worldwide food production: Fertilizer shortages. Those of you who made money on the various fertilizer shortage DD's floating around here a couple months ago know what I'm talking about, global fertilizer production was down at least 30% this year thanks to things like Ice Storm Uri, Hurricane Ida, and of course the Ukraine War and resulting sanctions on Russia, China stopping all Urea exports, and plenty more, which led to prices more than doubling.

Now, generally speaking, fertilizer is worth about a 50% increase in crop yields. So a 30% decline in supply comes out to a 15% drop in food production, plus the losses from Ukraine, which are worth about 5% of total world food production (7% of wheat), and we're at a 20% shortfall in worldwide food production. Sadly, there's more thanks to the weather. While most of America's farmland is in a drought, Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri are actually getting too much rain, and its lasted so long that Soybean planting is way, way, way behind schedule.

Meanwhile up in Canada, the planting season got delayed by a week due to heavy snow and rain, which means if there's an early frost the Canadian Spring Wheat crop is going to take a massive hit. Spring Wheat is 75% of Canada's yearly production. Meanwhile Canadian wheat exports are down 40% yoy right now due to decreased exportable supply, thanks to a 38% production reduction due in large part to COVID induced shortages.

China, another large crop producer, is facing significant problems with flooding this year, mainly in the southern provinces like Guanxi and Guangdong. Basically, everywhere along the Yangtze River is getting overloaded with too much water, which has caused damage to 30 million acres of crops. At a recent party meeting China's agricultural minister stated that conditions were the worst in history. None of this is helped by the corrupt and incompetent local and national governments that are doing a terrible job of mitigating the issues from flooding. For example, in Zhengzhou, despite warnings from meteorologists, little was done to mitigate flooding, leading to almost 1000 deaths across the region and scenes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

[That's... not right.](https://preview.redd.it/9ls2alktrc591.jpg?width=800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5c9a4c6ea0826bc36f01c89de878e027e10cb67)

US food exports to China tripled between 2018 and 2021, which offset the big losses from the autumn floods last fall, but that isn't looking like a repeatable pattern given US production difficulties. Some of you might think I'm being overly critical of the CCP here - I'm not, feel free to read ""Document No. 1"" for 2022, it's their main document about agriculture and food production, and the first third of it is just praise for Xi ""Winnie the Flu"" Jinping and his great spirit and plans. The rest of it is full of nonsense like ""Do a good job in grain production"" - that's an actual quote from it btw. Just like the Soviets learned the hard way, the CCP is discovering that the kind of bureaucrats that survive loyalty purges aren't big on imagination or competence.

So let's talk about US crop production. Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, Montana, and Texas are all experiencing droughts, Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Iowa, and eastern Kansas are getting too much rain, which is doing things like significantly impacting the ability of farmers to plant the years soybean crop in time to harvest it before winter. While in the US none of these issues will stop production, they will reduce yields per acre, and the crops produced will likely be lower in protein content. Total area under cultivation in the US is only up 3% YoY from 2021. The yield loss from reduced fertilizer alone is 5x that amount.

There is a new problem that has recently appeared, and that's a shortage of DEF. DEF stands for Diesel Exhaust Fluid. The stuff makes diesel engines run cleaner at about a 10% cost in fuel efficiency.It's needed for any big rig truck or tractor or combine or harvester built after 2014. The engines won't run without it. A shortage means the planting and harvesting machines don't work, and the delivery and long haul trucks don't run. If this comes to pass, and hopefully it doesn't, the results will be catastrophic.

I could go through a bunch more big agricultural countries, but it just gets kinda depressing, basically everyone who makes a lot of food is having significant production and weather issues this year.

So, adding all this up, conservatively, we get a 15% reduction from fertilizer shortages, 5% reduction from the Ukraine war, and 10% from weather (I'm using the same % from the '72 shortages because those were largely weather driven as well). And we get a relatively conservative estimate of a 30% reduction in global food production.

The last time there was a worldwide issue with food production was the Soviet Wheat Failure in the early 1970s. (There were also price spikes/output dips in 1994-1996 and 2006-2008) At the time US production was enough to offset the shortfalls in Europe and the USSR, but globally food prices increased by as much as 50%. That was on a roughly 10% decline in the production of wheat and other high protein grains. Today we're looking at at least a 30% decline in worldwide grain output, with the potential for slightly better or significantly worse numbers depending on the weather.

**During the 1972 Wheat Collapse, global food prices increased as much as 50% on a 10% reduction in supply. Today we're facing an unknown price increase on a 30%+ reduction in supply.**

If you're wondering, yes I've tried bringing this to the attention of elected officials in both parties. The main reaction I got was a staffer stuttering in fear before quickly bailing on the conversation. They know what's coming, and have no idea how to deal with it.

As for specifically how high this is going to drive food prices? Honestly no idea beyond just up, like up a lot, food is an item with pretty inelastic demand, because people gotta eat. Also, food prices and crop prices aren't a 1:1 ratio, because of the high costs of shipping, markups, and spoilage. For example, a head of lettuce that costs $2 at the store might cost only $0.12 to grow. Meaning that even if the cost of producing lettuce doubled, the price you pay would only rise by 6%, not 100%.

So, now that you know there's massive food shortages incoming, how do you make the money? Don't worry, I'm here to tell you. The first and most obvious way is to buy calls on crop futures.

\[Banned name\] is an ETF that tracks Wheat futures. (technically it only tracks Red Wheat, but in a shortage people will interchange and take whatever they can get) Here's a chart if you're into that kind of thing.

Going long on any of these I *highly*, *HIGHLY* recommend shares and calls out to Jan 2023. The harvests will start coming up short in the next few months, but this isn't happening tomorrow. Weekly FD's will get you rekt down to nothing. Listen to Soldier Boy's PSA from the 80s here except replace drugs with FD's. You don't want to be a loser do you?

Going long on agriculture is the obvious way to play this, but there's another option for everyone who missed out on the collapse of Russian ETFs after the start of the war in Ukraine. Well, you're going to get multiple shots at replicating that here. The Arab Spring started and Syria collapsed because of a drought and spiking food prices. That's going to start happening again on a much larger scale. What you're looking for are countries with stupid, incompetent leaders, fragile economies and societies, and that are already in economic trouble. These are almost guaranteed to implode into civil war and societal failure when things start getting really bad.

So who meets these criteria? And are reliant on foreign suppliers for food? Turkey, Egypt, China and Venezuela, come on down! You're the next contestants on ""Which badly run country will implode and flood their neighbors with refugees!""

**Turkey** \- Erdogan is the guy who thinks that the best way to fight inflation is to print more money, and no, sadly, I'm not making that up. Now, Turkey does only import about 7% of it's food, but instability has a tendency to spread, there's a dedicated Turkey ETF \[Banned Name\] and the country is already suffering from hyperinflation and otherwise in shambles. Plus, they have a long history of military coups. Some generals gonna get froggy here sooner or later. Downside, \[Banned Name\] options only go out to November, and the chain is extremely illiquid.

**Egypt** \- El-Sisi is, frankly, an ass. Basically he's the Egyptian version of all the tin-pot dictators the US trained up for South and Central America back in the 80's. He took over in 2014 with a narrow victory of only 97% of the vote. He's only run against pro-government candidates since. They have their own ETF \[Banned name\], they're incredibly dependent on Ukranian grain - about 23% of their total food supply is imported. Downside, \[Banned name\] doesn't have options, so you can't buy puts.

**Venezuela** \- this is like the ultimate poster child for a country that's going to descend into (even more) chaos when food prices explode. Sadly, it's already such a basket case that the biggest ETF exposure to it I could find is 0.37%, which is pointless. But hey, if you can figure out a way to short this place, go for it.

Finally, the big one, **China**.

Seriously, China is beyond a mess. They're basically bankrupt, and their failed real estate companies are only held up by Wall Street being unable to get out of their long positions and forcing the ratings agencies to avoid giving them the ""D"" and triggering their bonds' cross default provisions. Xi is the most incompetent leader they've had since Mao, and he's managed to consolidate his power. They appear to have locked Shanghai back down to prevent bank runs from getting out of control, and foreign capital is fleeing while record floods devastate their food production and the official government response is a document that basically says ""try harder"" and ""don't fail"".

They have tons of very liquid ETF's to buy puts on. And even inverse ETFs to buy calls on. YANG for example is under $13 right now. Again, aim for a long time frame here, Jan 2023 should be your starting point.

Personally, I have a small position in OTM Jan 2023 YANG and \[Banned name\] calls, it's a side position to the well over 90% of my portfolio that's long GME.

**Super Short Summary: Not enough food for everyone, bad things happen. Short emerging markets and the second and third world. Long agriculture futures.**

*EDIT: Specific positions are 3x Jan 2023 18c in \[Banned name\] and 3x Jan 2023 40c in YANG.  I wasn't kidding when I said my positions here were small because most of my port is tied up in one security.*

*Yeah, I'm aware of stuff like the dropping level of Lake Mead, the Italian issues with river flow dropping so much that seawater is backing up the channels and poisoning the ground, the food processing plant fires, and more.  I stopped writing about them because it was genuinely getting depressing.  There are many more options, tickers, and ways to play this than just what I listed here.*

*But make no mistake, the food shortage is NOT priced in yet, and it's significantly worse than people are aware of.  And no, it won't be the end of civilization in first world countries.*

EDIT: just more than doubled my positions. I'm buying the dip. As always, you're free to do what you want. 6/30/22.  I'm comfortable with my research and timeframe. Will continue to average down. Invest only what you're comfortable with.

So, as a 57 year old crone who hasn't had a period in years, I fully plan on saying YES and wasting as many of their tracking resources as I can.  

I'm hoping that spreading false information about our cycles and inventing pregnancies at state borders could wreak havoc on the system and in doing so, might confuse them enough to allow younger women to pass through especially if they're seeking abortions or birth control.  

I might even save my dogs pee to totally confuse their pregnancy tests, why the hell not? 

My point is that if they're going to do this, we can make it hell for them.  

I can just see it: ""Yes officer I'm pregnant, I've missed several periods""  then let them roll out the welcome mat, lie on all their questions and then pretend ignorance since they love to brand us as stupid: ""why, officer, if a female in your camp misses a period, surely everyone knows what this means, you're an educated law enforcement officer, are you not? "" 

Download a period tracker and lie on it.  

I want to create enough confusion and chaos at borders that they'll simply stop asking just to not deal with stress and bullshit. I want to poison their data.  If they're using technology to catch fertile women, we should use the same technology to hide and protect them by throwing smoke screens everywhere we go.  

This in itself sounds juvenile and ineffective but imagine if enough older women do this.  In all 50 states.  And right now they're not preventing pregnant women to leave the country but they will.  So I will lie and pretend to be pregnant, and I will force them to start the process only for them to realize after much wasted time and resources that it was all for nothing.  I want to cripple their tracking system.  

And if women all join together I'm pretty sure we can do this.  But all infertile/older  women need to do this to protect the younger ones.

EDIT: We are in the PLANNING STAGES.  Does anyone here really doubt that such a horrific scenario is exactly where we're going?  We need to start mindfucking them now, before they can even implement any woman tracking system.  Because they will, especially if we stay complacent and do nothing.  
Preemptive destruction of every shitty underhanded unconstitutional thing they do.  It's already gone too far, we must do more than just resist.  We must fight them now to protect the fertile women's right to choice.  

This is OUR guerilla warfare.  And if they implement a snitching system, we corrupt that too by reporting people we know cannot possibly be pregnant.  Send those misogynistic fuckers running like headless chickens in every direction but the one they intended.  Weaponized disinformation to force them to waste resources and hopefully allow the fertile women to stay free.

**My stepmom was my dad's AP**

My stepmom was my Dad´s AP

This is my first time using reddit and english is not my first language

When i (22M) was 4 my Dad(42M) divorced my mom. About a year later he introduced me to my stepmom (42F). She had two twin girls( N and D 22F). They married only a few months and went on to have three more kids, G( 16M) L(10M) and S(4F).

My father adopted N and D because their bio father was not involved. I´ve always considered all 5 of them ( N,D,G,L and S) my siblings and we´ve never used step or half to refer to eachother.

When i was 6, shortly after G´s birth, my mom passed away in a car accident and because of it i started to live with my dad full time.

My relationship with my  stepmom improved from there. She never adopted me however she, along with my dad, keept my mom´s memory alive by keeping in touch with my maternal grandparents and other relatives and visiting her grave with me on special days. I started calling her mom when i was around 7 or 8 and she refers to me as her eldest child ( me and the twins are the same age but i was born first)

After i turned 18 i started to work but i continued to live with my parents.

Last week i was in the attic when i found a photo album that i have never seen before. I opened it and i saw several pictures of my dad, my stepmom and the twins when they were babies, which made no sense to me because, like i said we were todlers when our parents met.

I decided to confront my parents about it. They were sit alone in the kitchen and asked them how they met, they told the same story, that soon after my dad´s divorce he met my stepmom though a mutual friend. when they were done i place one of the pictures on the table and told them that i wanted the truth.

I could tell by my dad´s face he understood what i meant. My dad told me that his marriage with my mom was going though a hard time because of my mom´s infertility issues, one day he met my stepmom and things escalated quickly and when he was ready to leave my mom she founded out that she was pregant but so did my stepmom at the same time, he lied to my mom several times so that he could spend time with my stepmom and the twins, one day he admited to my mom that he was having an affair and they got divorced.

I looked at my stepmom and she was in tears, they both tried to say sorry but i just couldn´t stay in that house any longer. i´m currently staying at my gf´s parents house. I have talked to G, L and S, it pained me alot and G has said that S has cried for me and that just breaks my heart.

I have refused to talk with my parents or to N and D. The three of them lied to me.

I feel like my life was built on lies and i am lost, i do not know what to do, i still love my sisters and my parents but they, especialy my parents, have hurted me. so much.

Edit: 

I wanna thank everyone for their input on my situation. 

I have come to the conclusion that i should talk with N and D, i will send them a message so that we can meet in person and talk about it.

I will also try to meet my younger siblings because i have not seen them since last week, just talked to them over the phone, and i missed them.

About my parents i do not know what i will do, i need to talk to them so that i can get atleast some cloesure but i don't know if i will be able to do it.

Thank you everyone!

**My sisters knew about our father's affair with their mother**

Read my last post so you can understand.

Before anything i would like to thank everyone who commented on my last post.

I have seen common questions being asked i i'll reply to them:

-""Did your mom really had fertility issues?""-Yes, her family  has told me many times she got really afected by it and that my birth was a got her over the moon.

-""Did the twins knew?""-i did not knew if they knew thats i talked to them.

Now onto the update;

After i made my post i made a group chat with the twins and texted them and we decided to met 

My GF wanted to come with me but i told her i would rather go alone. When i arrived they were already there, they asked started to try to make small talk i just asked them if they knew, they started to tear up and told me that they always knew my dad but only knew that they were his daughters when they were 16 because our parents told them, they initially wanted to tell me but my dad and stepmom pressed them not to saying that if they told me it would destroy our family. I asked how were things at home, they told me that G and L started to be rude to them and to our parents while S was asking about me.

They asked me if i could forgive them, i told them that i still love them but i just need time they told me they understood. I said i was sorry and that i shouldn't blame them for our dad's mistakes, they told me they should have told me earlier, we hugged and cried together. We said our goodbyes and then i went home, my gf asked me how i was and i just broke down, she held me tight and told me to not hold on and that she was there for me, words cannot discrive how much i love this woman she has been my rock though out all of this.

I talked with my younger siblings this morning and we met at park. I hugged them really tight especialy S, i'm super atached to her and i am really protective of her i tried to explain to her, in a todler friendly way, that i was mad at our parets because they did a ""bad thing"" and not at her, she asked if i was ever going back home, i told her i didn't knew but i still loved her. I talked to my brothers to see how they were holding on,G and L told me they had been having a hard time because they never tough our parents could do something so horrible, they told me they missed me but understood why i had to leave. 

We spent the morning together and after luch they went back home.

I haven't talk to my parents yet and i plan to call my maternal grandparents tonight to see if they knew or not.

Thank everyone for their support you guys have helped me a lot

**I talked with my grandparents about my father's affair.**

TLDR about my last two posts: My dad cheated on my mom with my stepmom, my twin stepsisters whom my father adopted are actually his bio daughters.

Yesterday i went to visit my maternal grandparents, first we mad the usual small talk and then i told them i needed to tell them something serious.

I layed it all out, the affair, the twins faternity everything . To say my grandparents were shocked would be an understatement. My grandma started to cry her heart out asking herself how could my dad ""hurt my baby girl like that"" my granddad was more angry he called my dad and stepmom everything he could think of. My grandparents always tough that my parents had divorced because they didn't just worked out and because they were young and despite not being their son-in-law anymore they mainted a great relationship with my dad.

After my grandma calmed down she asked me how i was doing, i told her that its been hard but i am doing better now she said she still couldn't believe my dad would do something so horrible to my mom, my grandpa said if my dad is lucky they would never laid eyes on eachother because my grandpa would do something that would put him in jail, if you understand me.

We spent the rest of the day catching up and talking about my mom, overall it was very intense but opening up to people who loved my mother like i did helped me a bit.

Thanks for reading.

Context: 

I (22f) have known Ive wanted to be a mom and have a family since I was little. Ive been with my partner (24m) for six years now, and he was aware of this. He supported it, but obviously wanted to wait to start trying till we were older . I felt the same given we were still young when we first got together and not in the position to start a family. 

But now we have both graduated from college, are working stable jobs, and are engaged. Now that we are at this stage we discussed and agreed to start actively trying for a baby. That was about 7 months ago. Hes know how badly Ive wanted this and has seen how upset Ive gotten each month when tests come back negative. But he always supported me and comforted me telling me itll all happen soon. 

But it didnt. Two weeks ago he told me we need to talk. those words never sound good. And they werent. 

He end up telling me that he had a vasectomy performed while I was on a trip with friends for my 21st birthday last year. While I respect his decision to do so, I still cant help but be hurt that he did this and yet kept telling me not to worry and that itll happen soon and how excited he was to be taking this step. 

I just dont understand why he couldnt have told me he wasnt ready or didnt want kids. Prior to us starting to try I was on birth control and we used other protection methods. I really thought we were on the same page about wanting kids someday and when we decided to start trying.

Im just in complete shock that he hid such a major thing from me. We havent been speaking much and hes been staying with his brother since he told me. 

I dont know how we can work this out or move past this. I still love him, but Im hurt that he acted like nothing was wrong. Its making me doubt if I even want to go through with our wedding now, but at the same time I dont want to leave. 

TLDR: Ive been with my partner for 6 years. We recently have been trying to get pregnant. After a while of no luck he revealed he had a vasectomy that I was unaware of.

UPDATE

Ive gotten a lot of messages and questions regarding a update ,  I met to talk with my fiancé this morning and figured I would share the outcome of that conversation. As well as answer a lot of questions Ive seen in comments or that I have received privately.

I have received a lot of questions/comments about his body, his choice. And yes, I do agree with this statement. I said in my original post I respect his decision. It was his choice, his body, and his right to have a vasectomy performed. I never said I was upset that he had it done, but rather upset that when we began to start trying he acted as though he had not had it done and kept it hidden. Leaving me wondering why i couldnt get pregnant when he knew exactly why. That was the issue. I dont understand how that wasnt apparent.

Further, I had a lot of questions about how I couldnt tell he had it done. I know nothing about vasectomys. So yes, I believed his claim of having it done when I was gone on a girls trip for my 21st birthday. But comments about the healing time frame and follow up testing made me doubt this/doubt that he had it done. The more I looked into the time frame of having the procedure done, I doubted him. 

Before all of this came out, I never had any doubts in my partner. He was always very trustworthy, caring, kind, and loving. We rarely argue or fight and even when we have its been over minor things. I never saw any red flags and those in my personal life never did either. He was genuinely a great guy. 

Which is what made not just leaving hard. Weve been together for 6 years, and are we were set to be married in February. We have both invested so much time into this whole relationship as well as time and money into our wedding. So just ending things didnt feel that easy for either of us. 

We had been staying apart from each other to give us each time to cool down before discussing what this would mean for our potential to have a future together. 

We met this morning to discuss the situation/so I could ask him why he hid this and what he shocked me even more. 

I blatantly asked him why he had the procedure done and when he began having doubts about having kids. His response was that he never doubted having kids but started to doubt his ability to have one/get me pregnant. He followed this up by saying he never had the procedure and knew as little about them as I did. Instead he had apparently discovered he had a lower then average sperm count due to hormonal issues at a recent doctors appointment after he mentioned we had been trying without any luck. This appointment was in August. He brought paperwork detailing and proving this to our meeting as well. 

He told me he didnt know how to bring the topic up and mentioned that it made him feel embarrassed. And since he was told he wasnt infertile and that we may just have a harder time getting pregnant he said he was just hoping it would just eventually happen so he wouldnt have to say anything. He says he regrets hiding this, and regrets creating a lie to cover it, and I do forgive him. 

We did re discuss having kids to which he ensured me is something he still wants. I feel relief knowing his concern, words of encouragement, and comfort after every negative test was genuine as he did truly want them to be positive.

When I asked why he created the lie of having a vasectomy rather than just telling me about the fertility issues, it again went back to him saying he felt a sense of embarrassment about the issue. He said he thought saying he had this on purpose would save him the embarrassment of not being able to get me pregnant. He claims his inability to do so these last few months has made him doubt his masculinity and that by creating the idea that he purposefully chose to be sterile would make him seem like more of a man. 

While I dont fully understand this way of thinking, I guess I can slightly understand how these issues may have made him feel less than when he wasnt and shouldnt have felt that way. I offered him comfort and we discussed looking into medical interventions as well as just continuing to attempt to conceive naturally. 

Im not leaving my fiancé. Yes I was upset over his lie, but he deeply regrets it. We both still love each other, both still want to be married, and both still want kids. 

We will however be looking into attending individual and couples therapy to get over this. We are going to postpone the wedding since its only 4 months away, and Im the mean time keep trying to conceive naturally. We decided we will look into intervention methods after our wedding. 

I appreciate everyones advice on my last post, Thank you.

I will try to answer any further questions in the comments but hope this answers a majority of them/clears everything up. 

Thanks.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10elhph/aita_for_ruining_my_family_tree_and_making_my_mom/)**: January 17, 2023**

I F(22) have been dating my bf Luca M(23) since my senior year of hs. For a little context, Luca is infertile, and the chances of us having our kids are extremely low. I am well aware of this and it truly doesnt bother me. I have also never really wanted kids, especially at a young age. Luca and I are on the same page and we want to live our 20s free of the responsibilities kids bring.

My family on the other hand does not agree with our ways of thinking. I am an only child and the only one left to continue our bloodline - my dads words. We were having dinner and the conversation over dinner was going well until my mom and gma brought up the conversation of marriage and kids. They asked when we planned to get married and we said it wasnt our main priority. Mind you we have just begun our careers and are not in a financial state to even consider a wedding.

My mom's rebuttal to my statement was that she would cover any expenses, which also meant she would control everything, I said firmly no thank you we'll wait. They also discussed kids and said wed have to have them quickly because my fertile clock is ticking. Luca told them that was ok bc he was infertile.

My mom goes so you wont give me proper grandkids? She then goes and I quote, I have already accepted that my grandchild wont be pure with your genes now you say you cant have any at all. I blew up and asked what she meant by pure and that she was being completely disrespectful to us.

Luca is Cuban and has a darker complexion which my family seems to find an issue with. I have come to find out they have been bad-mouthing us behind our backs. She said that we have never had a mixed child in the family. Luca then asks if we were to have a kid would they not love it bc it wouldnt be white? They called him rude for insinuating such a thing.

I backed him up and said if we have kids or not is up to us and told them they were out of line. She also added that if we adopt wed ruin our family tree and it wouldnt be legit. I stood up and left with Luca, ending the conversation with youre all a bunch of f\*cked up \*ssholes.

That night I received a text from my mom. She started by saying I was ungrateful and I am a disgrace to the family. Saying I should be ashamed of how I spoke to her and that she deserves an apology. She called me after I left her on read and said I am being brainwashed by Luca. She says she can arrange an artificial insemination with one of her friend's (white) sons. That I should want kids, especially now because I can stay home and raise them. I called her a lunatic and said she was a bitch. I called her a racist bitch who I am frankly ashamed to call my mother. She cried and hung up and I received a text from dad saying I took it too far and I'm not allowed back in their home if I don't plead for their forgiveness and oblige by their standards. I replied fuck you and blocked them both. So, AITA?

***OOP is resoundingly voted NTA***

**Update (Same Post): 8 Hours Later**

First thank you for all the supportive advice and sweet words. I showed Luca the post and he sat there reading and dying at some of the responses he has never liked my family to be fair but put up with them for me. Id choose him over them any day of the week.

We also informed his mom, whose English isnt the best so we had to translate it, and she said that I have a family with her and to forget about mine. She is the true definition of a good mother and has shown me more unconditional love then my mother has in my 22 years of life. She has even been teaching me Spanish and how to cook Cuban food, a light in this whole situation.

I have gone completely NC with my family as of today. This incident occurred about a week ago. Luca and I have been looking for a place together and my family will not be knowing where that is.

An update on the situation: My cousin (moms side) who is a bitch (put nicely), seemed to have found my post and sent it to my parents and aunt. Frankly idgaf bc I kinda hoped theyd see the comments. They told her to tell me I was being an entitled bitch and shouldnt add fuel to the fire. They said that what they said isnt wrong in their eyes and the comments made them cry (lol). They added to the, how could i disrespect them when they raised me to be who I am which is a load of bs. I am nothing like my parents thank god and learned to make my own choices as a teen. I told them I never want to see them again and if they want to apologize they would have to get on their knees and beg for it from Luca and myself. I would also never allow them into my life unless Luca is on board as well. (Not gonna happen).

They went back to the marriage crap and started comparing me to their friends daughters who are housewives with good christian husbands raising family at my age while Im a whore who cant settle down. They claim our 5 year relationship is a scam because thats enough time to get married and make a commitment.

My cousin said this is why no one in the family ever liked me, because Im the out cast (in this case its a compliment). My cousin is a strong conservative who believes whatever her parents tell her. As soon as I had a mind of my own I never respected my parents beliefs which they hate me for. My cousin told me I was a traitor and to gth. I told her I just left hell and dont plan on going back lmfao.","BestofRedditorUpdates",6305,6305,0,0.96,0,0,2,652

His wife is as against the concept of surrogacy as it's possible to be and always has been. 

We found a friend who was willing, and we now have a son. SIL went crazy. She spent months blasting all of us about how horrible we all were, that we supported all sorts of terrible practices because we were doing this, etc. She refused to go to our baby shower or see us in the hospital, but she did send a ""new mom kit"" meant for our surrogate with things to help a pregnant person recover from childbirth. My brother apologized for her, but said he couldn't change her mind. 

A few months later, my brother and his wife announced a spontaneous pregnancy (after more than five years of trying). Our parents were thrilled, and so were we. We were willing to put it all behind us.  They had a daughter, and it only intensified her views. She refused to bring the baby over for holidays or to meet her cousin because she refused to have her daughter ""raised to view women as objects"". Years later, she's softened to have our parents around without us at least. 

My parents want the whole family together again. She's agreed to a compromise that she's willing to do holidays and family outings as long as we never tell the children that our son is from a surrogate. Our parents think we should do this because she ""has a point"" and they were ""always uneasy with it"". I don't agree. This isn't some shameful secret that we should be ashamed of. We didn't do anything wrong. My wife is adamant that we shouldn't but wants our son to have a cousin. My parents are calling me as much as I'll answer to beg me to consider.

*A cursed island that appears once every hundred years to host a game that gives six rulers of a realm a chance to break their curses. Each realms curse is deadly, and to break them, one of the six rulers must die.*

Welcome to the world of *Lightlark* by up-and-coming YA author and TikTok viral sensation Alex Aster. What started as a TikTok video for a book idea  pitched with the above tagline  became a bestselling young adult novel and even got signed with Universal pictures for a movie deal, all in the span of a year and a half. It sounds like a dream come true for any aspiring author  especially one who had struggled and paid their dues for years before finally striking gold. This seemed to be 27-year-old Asters story. She told her TikTok viewers that she had been struggling for ten years to get published, and aside from a failed middle-grade series she had published a year prior (well get to that), she faced rejection after rejection in her journey to be an author. Finally, with the viral success of her TikTok video pitching *Lightlark*, she was able to grab the attention of a large publisher.

As of August 2022, *Lightlark* has been published by traditional publishing house Abrams Books, reached number one on Goodreads, been blurbed and hyped up by prominent YA authors like Chloe Gong and Adam Silvera, and even landed Aster a spot on Good Morning America.

As of September 2022, the book has been review-bombed into the depths of 2 stars by disappointed fans, reviewers who received ARCs, and the TikTok mob.

So what happened? How did a book go from being so viral that it got published for its popularity, to being despised by a large percentage of its previous fanbase?

&amp;#x200B;

**Sapling**

Despite her TikToks remaining rather opaque about her true financial situation, Alex Aster can easily be considered rich. Considered Jacksonville royalty, her father is the owner of a Toyota car dealership that is one of the top performing dealerships nationally, her mother was a surgeon prior to immigrating to the US from Colombia, and her twin sister is the CEO of Newsette, a multi-million dollar media company, as well as of a new start-up with singer and actress Selena Gomez. Aster graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League school, and worked several other jobs (including trying to create viral TikTok music) before starting her journey as a writer. Her middle-grade series was traditionally published and did well, despite her hinting that it was a failure in interviews and TikToks  potentially to spin a rags-to-riches story around *Lightlark*.

After a few initial videos pitching *Lightlark* as a mix between *A Court of Thorns and Roses* and *The Hunger Games*, Aster continued to create TikToks to market the novel. These ranged from listing popular tropes that would be in her book, scene depictions involving dialogue, videos about the publishing process, and a healthy amount of gloating about her newfound success and how flummoxed she seemed about it all. Still, this sort of low-level bragging is commonplace on social media platforms such as TikTok, so many let it slide. More interestingly, Aster posted many videos with other large YA authors, like Chloe Gong, Adam Silvera, and Marie Lu, who appeared to her friends. The social media marketing (a field her sister is prominent in) worked like a charm, and *Lightlark* shot up the Goodreads list due to pre-orders, even gaining a movie deal with the producers of *Twilight* before publication.

In August, the first Goodread reviews began sliding in, first including blurbs from her author friends and various booktok influencers. Five stars across the board  and hey, if one of your favorite authors who wrote a best-selling novel says this book is the bees knees, why not trust their word and pre-order? But to some, there was something fishy about the reviews being so unanimously positive. Whispers began to swirl that something was rotten in the state of publishing&. who was Aster, really? How did she have so many author friends? Was she really the struggling-artist-turned-success-story that she often hinted at being? Was she really the epitome of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps (or, as she eloquently put it in her GMA interview, an example of where hard work can get you)?

Once the TikTok mob began sleuthing, they realized Asters true identity: Princess of Jacksonville.

Jokes aside, TikTok did not take well to the idea that the girl they thought was a true starving artist was actually a well-off woman with a CEO sister in media and writing. Though Aster never truly stated that she financially struggled or came from a poor background, her TikToks about starting from the bottom and struggling now seemed, at best, incredibly out of touch, and at worst, deliberately misleading. Indeed, despite her childhood home being worth two million dollars, she states that her six-figure book deal was more zeroes than shed seen in her life. By this point, the crowd was split  some believed that her background had nothing do with her ability to write a story, while others were disgusted at what they viewed as Aster mythologizing herself as a POC immigrant woman that started from nothing and built an empire armed with nothing but her own popularity.  Review-bombers descended upon the fertile lands of Goodreads, tanking the books reviews from 5 to 2 stars in just a week.

&amp;#x200B;

**Tropeling**

But all this controversy was just about Aster herself, right? Surely the book, picked up immediately by a publisher after hearing about it, generating so much positive buzz by booktok, reviewed by multiple prominent authors& surely it had to be good.

Then ARC reviews started to pour in& and woo. They were not good. *Lightlark* is a poorly constructed novel, with plot and worldbuilding that seemed incomplete and befuddling even the most ardent of fantasy readers. Much of her book seemed to be an amalgamation of YA romance tropes that appeal to booktok, Sarah J Mass, Twilight and (insert whatever popular YA book the reviewer read prior to this one). Asters prose is slightly juvenile, even for YA, and repetitive, with strange phrases that should have been amputated by even a slightly proficient editor. Some small examples include:

It was a shining, cliffy thing (referring to an island)

It was just a yolky thing (referring to the sun)

she glared at him meanly (as opposed to sweetly)

But most readers of fantasy romance are willing to overlook a mediocre plot, stale characters, and bad prose  just look at the success of Sarah J. Mass  for swoonworthy bad boys to fall in love with and steamy scenes. This is everything Aster had promised for the last year on TikTok - and this is where a new problem arose. Many of the scenes, quotes, and tropes that Aster marketed in her TikToks were heavily changed or simply absent from the final product. Whats worse, Aster hinted at *Lightlark* being a diverse story with representation of groups that are traditionally excluded from fantasy and popular literary genres. Upon release, however, every character is described as pale, and theres only one visible black, gay side character  something reviewers found to be tokenism. Many of her fans who excitedly pre-ordered the book after watching her TikToks felt entirely scammed.

Faced with a barrage of insults and vitriol, questions about her background and her lies, and actual, good criticism of her novel, Aster and her editor took to TikTok, goodreads, and even reddit to defend the novel and&attack reviewers. This is never a good look in the book world, and authors who so much as even slightly defend themselves against a reviewers feedback are viewed negatively. Aster and her editor took it way further by mass deleting any form of criticism and hate and discrediting every negative opinion as trolls and haters.

**(Industry) Plantling**

Despite many TikTok viewers and ARC reviewers disliking her book, feeling scammed, or disliking Aster and her background, Asters TikTok comment section is relatively positive, and most of the press surrounding her talks about her TikTok success story. Popular influencers in the booktok world have rave-reviewed her book, something longtime fans of these influencers have found suspicious.

Could Alex Aster be an industry plant all along, a rich girl who wanted to get famous for anything partnering with a publishing company to capitalize on her TikTok fame? Were all the influencers paid off to say good things only about her book? What about all those other popular authors who hyped it up?

Thoughts are still mixed on this. Some people say that Asters entire journey is entirely fabricated, while others believe that this is a failing on booktoks part  still others believe the truth lies in the middle. It might be true that Asters family (including her sister) had connections with the publishing industry to get her work in front of the right eyes. It might be true that they helped plan and fund her social media marketing campaign for the book. Or it may be true that her parents simply offered her a place to stay and the financial backing that ensured her daily needs were met. Asters story is nothing new either. In 2020, popular booktubers (this is booktok on Youtube, for all the younguns) like polandbananasbooks (Christine Riccio) and abookutopia (Sasha Alsberg) had their books picked up by companies that were looking for a quick buck, even though the plots were thin and writing was lackluster. For many years, and especially since the advent of social media, readers have always been wary and aspiring authors bitter of the celebrity/influencer-to-author pipeline

So, whatever the story of Alex Aster truly is  industry plant or unfortunate scapegoat of her publishing companys ineptitude - the journey of *Lightlark*, from 20 second viral video to 400-page viral bestseller, is one of privilege, company greed, and the power of hype in a world fueled by hashtags.","HobbyDrama",6109,6109,0,0.98,6,1,0,738

In my beloved Ukraine,

My tomb upon a grave mound high 

Amid the spreading plain,

So that the fields, the boundless steppes, 

The Dnieper's plunging shore 

My eyes could see, my ears could hear 

The mighty river roar. 

&amp;#x200B;

When from Ukraine the Dnieper bears 

Into the deep blue sea

The blood of foes ... then will I leave

These hills and fertile fields --

I'll leave them all and fly away

To the abode of God,

And then I'll pray .... But until that day

I know nothing of God.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh bury me, then rise ye up

And break your heavy chains

And water with the tyrants' blood

The freedom you have gained.

And in the great new family,

The family of the free,

With softly spoken, kindly word

Remember also me.
