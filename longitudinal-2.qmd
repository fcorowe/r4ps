Since its outbreak in late 2019, COVID-19 affected millions of people
worldwide. One of the ways to track the spread of the disease is through
the collection and analysis of data on daily cases, which has become a
crucial component of new digital footprint trends. Contact tracing apps
and tools were developed and implemented in many countries to help track
the spread of COVID-19.

Data on daily cases can help us evaluate the effectiveness of policies
implemented during the pandemic, such as lockdowns and other
restrictions. By analyzing these data, policymakers and public health
experts have gained insights into the impact of these policies on the
spread of the disease [@goodman2020using, @brodeur2021covid] and
[@zhou2021varying]. For instance, if daily cases decrease significantly
during a lockdown, it could indicate that the policy was successful in
controlling the spread of the disease.

Data on daily cases can also help policymakers to make informed
decisions about when to implement or lift certain restrictions. For
example, if daily cases start to rise again after a lifting of
restrictions, it may indicate that it is too early to do so, and that
more caution is necessary. In summary, data on daily cases was an
essential tool for evaluating the effectiveness of policies implemented
during the COVID-19 pandemic and making informed decisions about future
policies. As we will see in this chapter, evaluating COVI9-19 policies
based onn cases is, unfortunately not so simple.

To assess government interventions during the pandemic, we will be using
**difference-in-differences** (diff-n-diff), a widely-adopted
quasi-experimental design, used to evaluate the effect of an
intervention or exposure on an outcome of interest. This strategy
involves comparing the change in the outcome before and after the
intervention or exposure in the treated group, relative to the change in
the outcome over the same time period in a control group. By doing so,
diff-n-diff can help isolate the effect of the intervention or exposure
from other factors that may be driving the outcome.

## Data

First let's import the Greater London COVID-19 data:

```{r}
# import csv 
covid_cases_london <- read.csv("data/longitudinal-2/covid_cases_london.csv", header = TRUE)
# check out the variables
colnames(covid_cases_london)
```

Then we do the same for the Lazio area data, which is the Region of the
capital of Italy, Rome. We are choosing this region because it did not
see sharp peaks in COVID-19 cases during the winter of 2020/2021.

```{r}
# import csv 
covid_cases_lazio <- read.csv("data/longitudinal-2/covid_cases_lazio.csv", header = TRUE)
# check out the variables
colnames(covid_cases_lazio)
```

First we need to clean up the data somewhat and rename some variables in
both dataframes to have 4 variables:

-   `date`: year-month-day

-   `geo`: geographical region

-   `cases`: number of COVID-19 cases that day

-   `area` : Lazio (Rome) or London

```{r}
# Rename the variables in the Lombardia data frame
covid_cases_lazio_ren <- covid_cases_lazio %>%
  rename(date = data , geo = denominazione_provincia, totalcases = totale_casi) 

# Group the data by region and calculate total cases for each day (not cumulative cases)
covid_cases_lazio_daily <- covid_cases_lazio_ren %>%
  group_by(geo) %>%
   mutate(cases = totalcases - lag(totalcases, default = 0)) %>%
  select(date, geo, cases) %>%
  mutate(area = "Rome (Lazio)") %>%
  filter(cases >= 0)

#df_milan <- covid_cases_lombardia_new %>%
#  filter(geo == "Milano", new_cases >= 0)

# Rename the variables in the first data frame
covid_cases_london_ren <- covid_cases_london %>%
  rename(date = date , geo = areaName, cases = newCasesBySpecimenDate) %>%
  select(date, geo, cases) %>%
  mutate(area = "London")

# Correct date format
covid_cases_london_ren$date <- as.Date(covid_cases_london_ren$date)
covid_cases_lazio_daily$date <- as.Date(covid_cases_lazio_daily$date)

# Append the renamed data frame to the second data frame
covid_combined <- rbind(covid_cases_london_ren, covid_cases_lazio_daily)

# Add a variable of log of cases
covid_combined <- covid_combined %>% 
          mutate(log_cases = log(cases))

```

## Data Exploration

Similarly to the previous chapter. Let's start by eyeballing the data.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: FALSE

# Visualizing Cases in London
covid_cases_1 <- ggplot(data = covid_cases_london_ren, aes(x = date, y = cases, color=geo)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option="magma") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom")
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    title = "Evolution in Covid-19 cases",
    color = "Region"
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months")

  covid_cases_1
  
# Visualizing Cases in Lazio (Rome)
covid_cases_2 <- ggplot(data = covid_cases_lazio_daily, aes(x = date, y = cases, color=geo)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option="magma") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom")
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    title = "Evolution in Covid-19 cases",
    color = "Region"
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months")
  
covid_cases_2

```

To identify whether there is a timeperiod where a lockdown was
implemented in one location but not the other, and how cases evolved, we
can plot aggregates of both locations in one plot.

```{r}
# Aggregate the data by region for each day
covid_combined_agg <- aggregate(cases ~ area + date, data = covid_combined, FUN = sum)

# Visualizing aggregated
covid_cases_3 <- ggplot(data = covid_combined_agg, aes(x = date, y = cases, color=area)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("darkblue", "darkred")) + # set individual colors for the areas
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    title = "Evolution in Covid-19 cases",
    color = "Region"
  ) +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "6 months")

covid_cases_3

```

From an initial look at the data, the 2020/2021 winter period seems
interesting as there is a high increase in London cases but not as much
as a peak in Lazio cases. In fact, after a quick review of COVID-19
lockdowns, we found that:

-   On the 5th of November 2020, the UK Prime Minister announced a
    second national lockdown, coming into force in England
-   On 4 November 2020, Italian Prime Minister Conte announced a new
    lockdown as well, however this lockdown divided the country into
    three zones depending on the severity of the pandemic, corresponding
    to red, orange and yellow zones. The Lazio region, was a yellow zone
    for the duration of this second lockdown. In yellow zones, the only
    restrictions included compulsory closing for restaurant and bar
    activities at 6 PM, and online education for high schools only.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: FALSE

# Usual chart
covid_cases_4 <- ggplot(data = covid_combined_agg, aes(x = date, y = cases, color=area)) +
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_manual(values=c("darkblue", "darkred")) + # set individual colors for the areas
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "",
    y = "",
    title = "Evolution in Covid-19 cases",
    color = "Region"
  ) +
  scale_x_date(limit=c(as.Date("2020-08-01"), as.Date("2021-01-15"))) +
 geom_vline(xintercept=as.numeric(as.Date("2020-11-05")), linetype="dashed") +
  annotate("text", x=as.Date("2020-11-06"), y=25000, label="Lockdown", 
           color="black", fontface="bold", angle=0, hjust=0, vjust=0)

covid_cases_4

```

We could make some assumptions and set this up as a quasi experiment. In
social science, researchers are often using natural or quasi
experimental setting as randomized experiments can rarely be conducted.
This involves splitting the population at hand into a treatment and
control group.

## Difference in Difference

**Plotting Means**

For a `diff-in-diff` analysis using COVID data, possible shocks that
would make this type of quasi-experiment possible could be the
following:

-   **National lockdown**: The first national lockdown in the UK was
    announced on March 23, 2020. This sudden shock to the economy and
    society could be used as a treatment group for the diff-in-diff
    analysis, with the pre-lockdown period as the control group.

-   **Regional lockdowns**: The UK also implemented regional lockdowns
    throughout the pandemic, with different regions experiencing
    restrictions at different times. These regional lockdowns could be
    used as treatment groups, with regions that did not experience
    lockdowns as the control group.

-   **School closures**: In response to the pandemic, schools in the UK were
    closed from March 20, 2020, until June 1, 2020, and then again from
    January 5, 2021, until March 8, 2021. The impact of school closures
    on education outcomes could be studied using a diff-in-diff
    approach, with the period before school closures as the control
    group.

-   **Travel restrictions**: The UK implemented various travel restrictions
    throughout the pandemic, including quarantine requirements for
    travelers from certain countries. The impact of these travel
    restrictions on the tourism industry or the spread of the virus
    could be studied using a diff-in-diff approach.

-   **Vaccine rollout**: The UK began its COVID-19 vaccination program in
    December 2020. The impact of the vaccine rollout on various health
    and economic outcomes could be studied using a diff-in-diff
    approach, with the period before the rollout as the control group.

These are just a few examples of shocks that could be used for a
diff-in-diff analysis using COVID data. The choice of shock will depend
on the research question and the data available.

The DiD approach includes a before-after comparison for a treatment and
control group. In our example:

-   A `cross-sectional comparison` (= compare a sample that was treated
    (London) to an non-treated control group (Rome))

-   A `before-after comparison` (= compare treatment group with itself,
    before and after the treatment (5th of November))

The **main assumption** is that without the change in the natural
environment the outcome variable would have remained constant!

First, we create a dummy variable to indicate the time when the
treatment started. In our case this will be the 5th of November 2020. We
will also limit the time-span of our data.

```{r}
# keep data from 2020-09-01 to 2021-01-01
covid_combined_filtered <- covid_combined %>%
  filter(date >= "2020-09-01" & date <= "2021-01-01")

# create a dummy variable to indicate the time when the treatment started (8 March 2020)
covid_combined_filtered <- covid_combined_filtered %>%
  mutate(after_5nov = ifelse(date >= "2020-11-05", 1, 0)) #changed to 05 Nov
```

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE

# create a dummy variable to indicate the time when the treatment started (8 March 2020)
covid_combined_filtered <- covid_combined_filtered %>%
  mutate(after_5nov = ifelse(date >= "2020-12-15", 1, 0)) #changed to 05 Nov
```

```{r}
# Create a frequency table of area and treatment
freq_table <- table(covid_combined_filtered$area, covid_combined_filtered$after_5nov)

# Print the frequency table
print(freq_table)

```

We then want to plot averages to see differences between
treatment/control groups and before/after. But we can also calculate the
mean and 95% confidence interval. We can also use group_by() and
summarize() to figure out group means before sending the data to ggplot.

```{r}
#| messages: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE

plot_data <- covid_combined_filtered %>% 
  # Make these categories instead of 0/1 numbers so they look nicer in the plot
  mutate(after_5nov = factor(after_5nov, labels = c("Before 5 November 2020", "After 5 November 2020"))) %>% 
  group_by(area, after_5nov) %>% 
  summarize(mean_cases = mean(cases),
            se_cases = sd(cases) / sqrt(n()),
            upper = mean_cases + (1.96 * se_cases),
            lower = mean_cases + (-1.96 * se_cases)) 

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = area, y = mean_cases)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
                  color = "darkred", size = 1) +
  facet_wrap(vars(after_5nov))
```

Here, we can start to see a diff-in-diff plot, where there is little to
no difference in means with our control city (Rome-Lazio) and a
substancial jump in means in our treatment city (London). It looks there
were many more cases of COVID-19 after the 5th of march in London,
indicating the lockdown did not have an effect, at least in this
time-frame. Why could that be?

We can also plot a more standard diff-in-diff format:

```{r}
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = after_5nov, y = mean_cases, color = area)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), size = 1) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = area)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkblue", "darkred"))
```

This second plot shows us it is probable that our diff-n-diff set up
will not work. A clean classic diff-n-diff would look more like the
following. Please note the following plot is theoretical.

```{r}
#| messages: FALSE
#| warning: FALSE

# import csv 
covid_perfect_example <- read_csv("data/longitudinal-2/example_covid.csv")

# label pre/post labels
covid_perfect_example <- covid_perfect_example %>%
  mutate(after_5nov = factor(after_5nov, labels = c("Before 5 November 2020", "After 5 November 2020")))

# plot    
ggplot(covid_perfect_example, aes(x = after_5nov, y = mean_cases, color = area)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), size = 1) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = area)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkblue", "darkred"))

```

**Difference in Difference by hand**

We can find the exact difference by filling out the 2x2 before/after
treatment/control table:

|            | Before | After | Difference        |
|------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Treatment  | A      | B     | B - A             |
| Control    | C      | D     | D - C             |
| Difference | C - A  | D - B | (D − C) − (B − A) |

A combination of group_by() and summarize() makes this really easy. We
can pull each of these numbers out of the table with some filter()s and
pull():

```{r}
before_treatment <- covid_perfect_example %>% 
  filter(after_5nov == "Before 5 November 2020", area == "London") %>% 
  pull(mean_cases)

before_control <- covid_perfect_example %>% 
  filter(after_5nov == "Before 5 November 2020", area == "Lazio") %>% 
  pull(mean_cases)

after_treatment <- covid_perfect_example %>% 
  filter(after_5nov == "After 5 November 2020", area == "London") %>% 
  pull(mean_cases)

after_control <- covid_perfect_example %>% 
  filter(after_5nov == "After 5 November 2020", area == "Lazio") %>% 
  pull(mean_cases)

diff_treatment_before_after <- after_treatment - before_treatment
diff_treatment_before_after

diff_control_before_after <- after_control - before_control
diff_control_before_after

diff_diff <- diff_treatment_before_after - diff_control_before_after
diff_diff

```

The diff-in-diff estimate is 131.99, which means that the lockdown here
caused an increase in cases in the time-window we are analysing. Not
it's intended effect!

We can visualise this really well with a bit of extra code:

```{r}

ggplot(covid_perfect_example, aes(x = after_5nov, y = mean_cases, color = area)) +
  geom_point() +
  #geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), size = 1) + 
  #geom_line(aes(group = area)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = as.factor(area))) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkblue", "darkred")) +
  # If you use these lines you'll get some extra annotation lines and
  # labels. The annotate() function lets you put stuff on a ggplot that's not
  # part of a dataset. Normally with geom_line, geom_point, etc., you have to
  # plot data that is in columns. With annotate() you can specify your own x and
  # y values.
  annotate(geom = "segment", x = "Before 5 November 2020", xend = "After 5 November 2020",
           y = before_treatment, yend = after_treatment - diff_diff,
           linetype = "dashed", color = "grey50") +
  annotate(geom = "segment", x = "After 5 November 2020", xend = "After 5 November 2020",
           y = after_treatment, yend = after_treatment - diff_diff,
           linetype = "dotted", color = "blue") +
  annotate(geom = "label", x = "After 5 November 2020", y = after_treatment - (diff_diff / 2), 
           label = "Program effect", size = 3)
```


It is important for all diff-in-diff analyses to give careful attention
to possible violations of the common trends assumption, especially
considering the COVID-19 situation where many of these violations are
likely to occur. Furthermore, due to the unique dynamics of COVID-19
such as lags between exposure and recorded infections, nonlinearities
from person-to-person transmission, and the possibility of policies
having differential effects over time, it further complicates the
potential risks to the diff-in-diff research design.

[@goodman2020using] comment on the following problems which can be
consulted in their paper:

-   Packaged Policies

-   Reverse Causality

-   Voluntary Precautions

-   Difference Data collection

-   Anticipation Spillovers

-   Variation in Policy Timing

[@goodman2020using] also give great recommendations on how to address
these problems, but this is far beyond the objective of this chapter.

**Difference-in-Difference with regression**

Calculating all the pieces by hand like that is tedious, so we can use regression to do it instead! Remember that we need to include indicator variables for treatment/control and for before/after, as well as the interaction of the two.

This is the equation:

$\Delta Y_{gt} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 London_{g} + \beta_2 Post5Nov_{t} + \beta_3 London_{g} \times Post5Nov_{t} + \beta_4 Rome_{g} + \epsilon_{gt}$

The output will show the diff-in-diff coefficient estimate, standard error,
t-value, and p-value, which can be used to determine whether there was a
significant effect of the second lockdown 4 on Covid cases in November 2020.

```{r}
model_small <- lm(cases ~ area + after_5nov + area * after_5nov,
                  data = covid_combined_filtered)

# Tidy the model output
diffndiff1 <- tidy(model_small) 

# Add significance stars using stars.pval from gtools
diffndiff1$stars <- stars.pval(diffndiff1$p.value)

# View the results
diffndiff1

# Create a model summary table for the model
summary_table <- modelsummary(list("Simple" = model_small), estimate =c("{estimate}{stars}"))

# View the results
summary_table
```

## Questions

For the assignment, you will continue to use Google
Mobility data for the UK for 2021.
For details on the timeline you can have a look
[here](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/2022-12/timeline-coronavirus-lockdown-december-2021.pdf). You will need to do a bit of digging on when lockdowns or other COVID-19 related shock happened in 2021 to set up a diff-in-diff strategy. Have a look at @brodeur2021covid to get some inspiration. They used Google Trends data to test whether COVID-19 and the associated lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being. 

Start by loading both the csv 

```{r load spatial data UK}
mobility_gb <- read.csv("data/longitudinal-1/2021_GB_Region_Mobility_Report.csv", header = TRUE)

```

1.  Visualize the data with `ggplot` and identify what section of the data could be used to evaluate a COVID-19 intervention. Examples of these interventions could be a regional lockdown, school closures, travel restrictions or vaccine rollouts. Generate a clean `ggplot` which indicates which intervention you are going to examine.

2.  Explore differences in means through a `frequency table` and a graph of these averages. Chose whichever suits your purposes best.

3.  Define and estimage a diff-in-diff regression. What do the results suggest? Was the intervention you chose effective? Discuss the reasons why it was or was not. 

4.  Discuss how the unique dynamics of COVID-19 and the possibility of policies having differential effects over time complicate the interpretation of your results. 

Analyse and discuss what insights you obtain into people's changes in behaviors during the pandemic in responde to an intervention.
